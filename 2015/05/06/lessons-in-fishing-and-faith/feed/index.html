					<description><![CDATA[Actually, I &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; found out about that (the different Greek words for &#039;love&#039; Jesus is using) shortly before your comment. I feel like we (the uneducated - in Greek/Hebrew) often miss out on a lot of nuances and meaning if we trust our translated versions of the Bible and just read the translated text as-is]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I was thinking about this too, especially when watching AD on TV, I was confused whether I was watching a flashback scene.
I love the dialogue asking Peter to reaffirm his love, but reading it with knowledge of the different Greek words for &quot;love&quot; used in that passage gives it a whole other meaning.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great reflection, Emily.  I think it&#039;s easy for us to lose hope and motivation,  especially when our faith is weak and we are overwhelmed by the circumstances. :) But Jesus was so loving to the disciples even after they fell back to their old self,  encouraging them once again,  and asking Peter to reaffirm his love for Jesus.]]></description>
