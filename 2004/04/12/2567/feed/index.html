					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;haha ^^ i had the same question for my dream!! &quot;Why did i end up giving him a hug?!?!?&quot; haha ^^ dreams are strange.. actually, it was more of a &quot;who is this guy i&#039;m hugging??&quot; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;usually in my dreams, i don&#039;t know the people... unlike your dreams, where u seem to knwo who you&#039;re dreaming about!! haha ^^ it&#039;s like dreaming about some stranger!! quite scary if u think about it.. haha ^^ &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;but yah, i finally read your article in the BAC Talk Newsletter!! isn&#039;t it great to come back to the church? but i guess it&#039;s not as good as it was before? something about the community? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;hm.. well i kinda noticed that too.. i mean i can see that there are so many people and that&#039;s great!! but we seem to be in our little groupies and there are always people alone, standing there.. but i guess this is really something our church needs to work on!! &lt;/p&gt;]]></description>
