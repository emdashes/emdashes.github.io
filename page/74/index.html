Why do we care? Or do you even care? Should we care? I’m sick, I contracted a cough from someone on Friday night, but that’s besides the point. On Friday night, instead of being my usual self and bumming around at home when Nexus was cancelled, I decided to go to 3D. I’m not sure why as my sane self usually would hold me back; I haven’t re-visited this fellowship ever since I’ve returned (maybe because it hurts to see my friends around me not feel welcome by my peers and well, I feel the same –  I don’t have the urge to invite my friends to this church anymore for this reason. Thankfully, the few times that my friends have visited, they at least enjoyed the time there – and a few people have introduced themselves). As I settle back here, one would think that the easiest thing to transition back into would be the church environment; but it’s not. Integrating with my school friends, work life, and the people I’ve met since I’ve arrived including my new fellowship has been okay, but integrating back into church life has been the most challenging. Anyhow, the topic discussed at 3d last night really scratched at what has been bugging me really much recently. It coincided perfectly with the article, er blog entry, uhm, java program that I am planning to submit to TalkBAC and the issues that I’m dealing with – it was very comforting to end the night in prayer, and have some of the girls pray for me and my current situation.
</p>



<p>
Caring. In the past while, I’ve found from experience that caring seems to result from compassion. And the compassion that I do have, definitely does not come from within me. Compassion “grows” in me toward the people that seem the most in need  – those that I, my selfish self, would not think to spend time investing in, but yet, something compels me to spend time with them, pray for them, and just love them – wanting to get to know them on a more personal level, even if *i* don’t want to – it’s an oxymoronic paradox. Ironically, I can identify that they are those who Jesus talk about: the outcast, lonely, hurt, lost, but oftentimes, they don’t know it, or outrightly tell me, but the aspects of their lives that are expressed leaves these impressions. And because of that, I just want to be there for them, in hopes that one day, they will find the joy, fulfilment, and purpose – filling the void in their inner being.

First and foremost, a big thank you for those who messaged me and called to check up on me; it’s nice to know that there are people who care :). Our Valentine’s Day theory held true – the mountain was empty. It was an excellent day for snowboarding and we took advantage of that. I learnt one thing this time – how to get off the lift without going “ker-splat”, but I still have yet to perfect the technique. Mel learned how to do that first (she has it down pact I believe) and she also figured how to ride heel-side so now we cut our trip down Collins from 1 hour (since the last time) to 20 mins =)! I’m still working on being able to go on my toe-side so that I don’t keep angling right because I can do heel-edge and I ride goofy. I’ve also learnt that the faster one goes, the worse wipeouts get. I managed to somehow  fall on my back, hear a “crack”, get up and see the word on the “slow” sign moving up and down quite quickly, not slowly (ie. dizzyness ensued). Thankfully, I got up and rode for the rest of the day, but suffered greatly for that particular wipeout – so much that I had to call in “sick” at work today because I have trouble moving my neck. But, Advil is my friend and I hope I will be back to 100% by the end of the week.</p>




<p>
Dug this up while I was cleaning my room – I made a Sunday School Scavenger Hunt for my kids back when I was in high school. Each clue led to another clue:</p>




<p>
Who am I?</p>




<ol><li>In the living room with cushions I will be<br>
In this room, you will find this clue under me.</li>

<br><li>I’m not an animal but I have legs,<br>
Nor a chicken because I don’t lay eggs.</li>

<br><li>I can be found in green or black,<br>
Teachers at school draw and write on my back.</li>

<br><li>Clear and transparent you can see me through,<br>
Whether the clouds are grey or the sky is crystal blue.</li>

<br><li>In every room I am round,<br>
Turn me and on the otherside, your clue will be found.</li>

<br><li>I make noise as I’m used by you<br>
You’ll use me for pencil crayons and for pencils too.</li>

<br><li>I stay in every classroom each and every day,<br>
I know that I’m not very popular because people hold their noses and turn away.</li>


</ol><p>Any guesses?
</p>

No wonder I get mistaken for a teen! Lol, my inner self must be counter-balancing my biological self. I normally avoid these subjective quizzes (since anyone can just make them up), but I took this one I found on my friend’s blog, and oh my, based on my answers, that’s what I got!</p>

<p>
Everything is new to me. I like watching the world<br>go by around me, and I don’t sweat the small<br>stuff–or the large stuff, either. Just so long<br>as I stay warm and safe and dry, life’s pretty<br>good.

Now that I’m out of school, I have moments where I miss the environment and convenience of Waterloo. If I ever needed to study, I could just step outside my “home”, and within 30 seconds, be on the perimeter of the campus and just spend hours there studying, dreaming, or playing Daytona/Initial-D at the SLC. And if I was ever bored, some people would graciously accompany me on walks the park in the snow, or to get stung by mosquitos in the trails. I had the convenience of being able to walk to a restaurant if I was hungry or thirsty, to k-ok w friends, or even bike to a friends’ place without having to worry about being too far. And when I was procrastinating, or when I was lazy, or if everything was too far away, there was always someone who offered to give a ride. Being back in the city has its advantages, but when everything is spread out – friends, food, fun – and not having a car readily available to me, I tend to fall to the sin of laziness. I take a look around me and realise how blessed I’ve been. If I had to drive to UBC to study, I probably wouldn’t even do that because of the time and effort it takes to drive there and back – it’s definitely not as flexible. Please note that I’m not trying to complain here. It’s just one of these reflective moods I sometimes fall into when I’m alone. I’m definitely looking forward to more outdoor activities when the sun comes back, and looking forward to Valentine’s Day…where I’ll be spending it with Melody on the slopes snowboarding (we figure that there may be less people since it’s a special day for couples and all and snowboarding isn’t exactly a very romantic way to spend the day).</p>




<p>I recently turned on the TV for no reason, and was immediately glued to it for an hour watching Sue Thomas: F.B.Eye.
Because I don’t have cable, and never did, nor do I really care if I ever will, I can’t compare that to any other show because I don’t generally watch TV (although I did see commercials for the OC so I guess it’s showing on Global (or was it CTV), which I have). Anyhow, the only reason why I enjoy this show is because the actress (and her character) is severely deaf, but like my ASL teacher at UW, she learned to speak and fluently read lips and use ASL to get by. So, aside for being inspiring, having the show base it on real character Sue Thomas, and having it contain very little violence and sex, I try to catch as much as I can of what she signs when they do on occasion. When they do carry a conversation in ASL, there is also subtitles to help us “illiterate” people out.</p>




<p>
And, now to follow-up with my last posting on lying. It’s ironic, because everyone who did comment, reflected a comment that was raised in our discussions during Sunday School class. Some people in my class claimed that if it was two evils, it’s better to do the less evil for the greater good. For example, if lying is wrong, and one had to lie to hide the Nazis, and s/he knew that was the Nazi’s did were evil, then ts/he’d lie. However, there seems to be a fallacy in that argument, but I can’t pinpoint it. It’s just very unsettling that they’d choose one evil over the other.</p>




<p>Another idea excused those who weren’t following God – how would they know that lying was wrong if they didn’t have His laws? – example being Rahab. Going on with the example of Rahab, others suggested the perhaps she was willing to sacrifice her very life for two strangers, and the Hebrew midwives for people they didn’t personally know, which is why God blessed their selflessness. The objection? If everything is relative, even today, why do we then impose moral laws on people such as sacrificing children to gods? God wrote those laws to be applied to all, not just one group of people. </p>




<p>
Some suggested that if we lie for the best, we can always ask for forgiveness later. That also disturbed me on two counts: 1) lying for the best – or for “just cause” as R wrote – even I don’t know if I have ulterior motives sometimes when I do things that seem right, so I agree with FH there; and 2) ask for forgivenss later – that’s just “abusing the system” I would think. It brings me back to Romans 1:1, and 15, where 15 says, “Shall we sin because we are not under law but under grace? By no means!”. That just doesn’t make sense if you think of it as a two-way loving relationship. I’m not entirely sure that I’ve resolved this issue myself, but I agree that w J. that God generally cares more about our attitude and what’s going on in our hearts than following rituals and rules. However, like I’ve mentioned before, I can never be 100% sure of my heart (esp when it comes to relationships, but that’s another topic for another day). So, what does my prof have to say about it?</p>




<p>Consider this: If you play chess, you try to outsmart your opponent to win the game. However, in the process, you may need to strategize and mislead your opponent into thinking that you want to advance in a certain direction, so that you can sneak up on him or her. Thus, in your calculations, you may end up risking one or two of your pieces, but in the end, you hope your strategy would win. But, because I’m not very good at chess, I don’t do that. I just go for it, and hope to eat as many of my opponents pieces as possible so that I can corner him and win, so that really didn’t strike a chord. However, it did occur to me that the card-game Cheat is played in a very similar, and definitely more obvious way. The whole goal of the game is to lie and cheat so that you can get rid of your cards and win the game. You wouldn’t want to say, oh, I don’t have any 4s and pick up the pile. The rules of warfare. Warfare is a very real game, with deception as one of its very tactics – you’d want to deceive the opponent into thinking one thing, when you have another plan up your sleeve (ex. Pearl Harbor). Have you noticed that in the OT examples I gave, the context surrounding the situations somehow evolved around “war” – one group out to destroy another.</p>




<p>
Hmm, I’m not very good at articulating my profs thoughts. I’m not God, so I may never really know why He blessed some and not others, maybe it was their sacrifical love to protect His people even though they didn’t know they were to be rewarded in later time, maybe it was the rules of engagement, or maybe it is totally different answer that I have yet to find out. But, I really don’t need an answer to go on living my life the way I should be living – “what does the LORD your God ask of you but to fear the LORD your God, to walk in all his ways, to love him, to serve the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul” (Deut. 10:12 NIV). And, because that was addressed to Israel, which we, as Christians, are symbolically a part of now, it applies to me – indeed, a very high calling to follow.</p>

Hahah, well, happy new year! I just realised that the entries in the past month were and are still dated incorrectly (ie. 2003) ~ either no one noticed, or no one bothered to point it out. I jumped onto the bandwagon today (ahem, much like A. Lexus) and joined <a href="http://www.bsfinternational.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bible Study Fellowship (aka BSF)</a> with my friend Mel, which is conveniently located at my church. Because we started mid-season, we were a l’il lost, but we’re going to commit to three weeks and try it out to see if we like it or not. Zeck told me that he didn’t like it when he first started but now that he’s back in, he doesn’t mind it anymore. Hrm. We attended the intro session for newcomers and to me, it sounded like a stereotypical AA meeting (not that I know how that one is like, mind you!). Hi, my name is ______ and my friend/relative/etc. referred me here. And, the first 20 mins sounded like it was straight off of a TV commerical advertising; it was actually quite amusing. Nevertheless, it makes me wonder if the BSF club as advertised at UW is a fraud (or a completely diff org altogether), considering they meet at Eunie/Vern’s complex even though the website says they met at the ex-Y (z! ha). Well, this group is unique in that it’s the only young-adult group in Canada – you gotta abide to the rule that you’re between the ages of 19-35 and are still single (unmarried). If you break any of those, you’re automatically kicked-out into the Men’s/Women’s groups around the city.</p>




<p>
Sunday School is serving to be quite interesting as well. It just so happens that BSF coincides withe the OT Survey class that I’m currently taking. Last Sunday, the prof opened a whole can of worms. The class was engaged in a lively debate in whether lying would be ever “right” in God’s eyes. Remember the 9th commandment? Well, you may also recall that Rahab hid the spies, lied about their location (Josh 2:4), and God later honoured her and her family not only by saving them, but also by letting her be a great…..grandmother of Jesus! In another case, er. I forgot. Oh riiight, back in the Prince of Egypt days, women who couldn’t have babies, became midwives. When they were questionned why they didn’t kill the Hebrew babies, they lied and told the king that the Hebrew woman already delivered when they got there. But instead of being displeased, God opened their wombs and blessed them with families (Ex 1:15-20! What do you guys think? I’ll post up the prof’s response in a few days.
</p>




<p>
To leave you off with yet another story – an evening playing badminton:


</p><blockquote>
Girl: So, what school are you from?<br>
Me: You mean high school?<br>
Girl: Yeah…<br>
Me: Oh, JH. You?<br>
Girl: FH…<br>
…<br>
[After 1 game]<br>
Girl: What grade are you in?<br>
Me: Er, actually, I’ve graduated…<br>
Girl: Oh! Then, what year are you in?<br>
Me: Ehm. I’m done that too. I’m working now. What about you?<br>
Girl#2 (who overhears this): What?! Seriously?<br>
Girl: Boy, you look young. I’m in Grade 11. I thought you were in Grade 12 max.<br>
Girl#2: [looks relieved that the other teen looks the same age as her] Phew, I’m in Grade 11 too.<br>
Me: Yeah, it happens a lot, I’m useta it…
</blockquote>

		<p>				Pentel gel pens at a store were selling for $0.57 caught my eye. I paused to look and saw some Winnie-the-Pooh items that I knew my sister would like. As I bent down to examine some things with Melody by my side, I saw someone familiar and noticed that he spoke like Skipper. When I stood upright again, it occured to me that I was in Victoria and that I should call Skipper up to see how he was doing. But before I finished dialing, he already saw me from the entrance of the store and walked over.</p>




<p>Later on, I attended a worship session. The worship leader, after finishing up with songs, proceeded to start off in prayer. We sat down on the floor, gathered in a circle and started to pray for the person on the right of us. Turns out that I ended up praying for Zhakyrnn again. I remember the worship leader first started off by praying for Tania (Sung) in saying, “Dear God, we lift up Tania tonight…” but I never got a chance to pray for Zhakyrnn not only because I was distracted by the cell phone or radio ringing in someone’s jacket (who was at the prayer meeting), but also because my alarm jolted me awake from my slumber.</p>

		<p>				so, I woke up very unrested this morning because of yet another dreamful night.</p>




<p>One of my closest friends who used to go to UW, is now in Toronto. In any event, I saw her again last night and I was really sad, because somehow I knew that I wasn’t going to see her again. I was especially sad because I wouldn’t be around reach out to her spiritual needs and somehow, I had the notion that I wasn’t going to be seeing her in the afterlife. After we departured, I ventured into a place of teens and kids, bumped into Clarence and asked him what was going on. Well, he soon told me that some of his teens had decided to use this facility for no reason, and that meant that their teens’ camp money would have to be used to cover the funds of damages and such. So he tried to round up some of the teens, and I found lil_star_angel (i don’t know her in real life) in a room with another girl, and I was like, “lil_star_angel, you’re aimee right?” and she asked me who i was, and how I knew her alias since most people she knew didn’t know she had xanga (this must have stemmed from her xanga blog that i was reading last night). anyhow, i led her to an auditorium where everyone was meeting, and then walked out . . . the other bits and pieces of my dream contained my classmates from elementary school and photo albums . . .</p>

Incident #328. Well, not really, but I’ve lost count how ghetto my neighbourhood is – yes, we have prostitutes standing on the corner two blocks down every morning (don’t know why it’d be morning, but they’re apparently diff girls everytime). I guess it doesn’t help that this city, with a population of 350,000 is the second largest in this area, outside of Vancouver. I thank God that He was definitely watching over my sister last night, and it sure hits close to home because it literally did happen close to home (within 5 houses down), to a family member, and it could’ve turned ugly if my sister didn’t lock her doors. By His grace, it was not me that was driving yesterday evening around 6:00 pm, for I am not in the habit of locking my car doors (I either forget or just don’t), even though my mother always reminds me.
</p>



<p>
<b>To my friends who drive near my neighbourhood: lock <i>ALL</i> your doors, <i>always</i>.</b>
</p>




<p>
Anyhow, my sister was driving alone and stopped at the stop sign waiting to turn onto the main street. Some caucasian guy steps out from the shadows and knocks on the passenger window, trying to say something to her. But, of course, my sister’s smart enough to ignore him. So then, he goes on to try to pull the passenger door open, but because my sister is more sensible than I am, she remembered to lock the door before she left the driveway. She almost honked the horn, but then I think God sent a guardian angel on time, and another car pulled out from another street and the guy ran away! I can’t believe she didn’t call 9-1-1. Aiiiieeee….I’d be traumatized for the rest of my life if I was in her position; I’m already quite emotionally shaken over this close call….at least I hope to remember to lock my doors when I’m in the car now!</p>

		<p>				in one scene, i found lil crab-like shelled bugs(?) that moved on my carpet, so i got my dog to kill them, and then as i peered down to examine them closer, i noticed more dull-gray and smaller ones crawling about blending into the colour of my brown carpet…so i quickly rushed to my parents, who told me to use a powerful vacuum clearner to clean out the infestation from my carpet. and in doing so, i saw ones that were flipped upside down, dead, and also dehyrdrated, dried up dead mosquitoes, some which i had to kill by sucking them up in pieces by the vacuum cleaner hose.</p>




<p>in another dream, i recall that some of us were hiding in a room from enemies. the threat of them invading the house, or having the windows implode were very real. so as i sat crouched down in between the dresser and a bed, with our bibles on our laps, i remember being impressed that God’s presence showed up and spoke to the few of us who were Christians, telling us not to worry for when the windows did break or if were to experience any pain before our death, it would mark the Second Coming. After he left, the people around me, who weren’t Christians, including Caroline, couldn’t understand the Bible passage that they were reading. I couldn’t tell them that I heard from God, but I remember saying that we may not be on earth for much longer, but if you trust in His Word and trust in Jesus, then you’ll not only be in heaven, but you’ll get to meet and spend time with God there. I also remember Him telling us to be avoid staying in the center of the bedroom, as the glass shards would likely fall onto the bed – either stick to the walls beside the window, or stay under or behind the bed. We assumed the earthquake position while sitting, and placed a blanket over our heads for preventative measure…and waited.</p>

		<p>				So I had a dream a few days ago, where I was in a hotel or a temporary room somewhere. I went up the brown-carpeted stairs into the cramped place where I was staying. I think we had just finished a party, but I knew that <em>they </em>were looking for one of my girl-friends, who happened to be, or resemble vonne.</p>




<p>As I was headig up the stairs, I noticed that ahead of me, 3 men were coming out of the elevator so I crouched down below the railing and headed to the back-stairs. The first flight of stairs I went on, sort of ended up meeting with the wall, so that was futile. I rushed over to the other side (sort of like counterstrike i suppose) and crept up the stairs peering over the top of the rail, knowing that they’d be looking for Vonne (who was hiding under the bed), while the others would be looking for me. I know that mid-way, I managed to get a good view of them and fired some shots…</p>




<p>Last night, the protagonist (or me) was a guy. He came home and his father asked him if he needed to take a shower, but he said that he had already and went to bed. On his way up the bunk-bed ladder, he saw a cup of tea on his desk and a small purple plastic ring with the top part in the shape of a flower, which he disregarded. He was too tired so he didn’t even bother drinking the tea.</p>




<p>The next day, he sees his girlfriend and she asks him if she saw the ring from her, which was supposed to be inside the teabag. She told him that after drinking the tea, one was supposed to see something in the teabag and open it to find a ring. Oops. He told her that he hadn’t the chance to drink the tea because he was too tired. So he went home, and tried to look for the ring. He enlists his friend to help him, but they don’t know where it was. But because the ring had somehow appeared outside of his tea the night before, he knew what it looked like. So, with the help of his male friend, he went to a local store to purchase a similar ring, but with gemstones around the centre of the flower (circling the “o” part). Thankfully, she liked it and said something to the lines of “how sweet!” – because he had bought her one to match the one she gave (like those sets that you see in the Chinese stores in Pacific Mall in TO cept this one was plastic). She automatically assumed that he had gotten the ring, because he knew what it looked like. He knew he would have to find the missing ring to avoid disappointing her…</p>
