		<p>				In my last post, I went on and on about AYCE sushi places, so maybe it’s time to highlight other “Japanese” restaurants.</p>




<p>Enter Tomoya, a relatively new and hidden gem (at least for Korean food).</p>




<p><strong>Tomoya: Japanese Bistro & Bar</strong><span class="adr"><span class="street-address"><br>325 Max Becker Drive<br></span><span class="locality">Kitchener</span>, <span class="region">ON<br></span><span class="phone tel">(519) 749-9997</span></span></p>




<p><span class="adr"><span class="phone tel">Date of last visit: July 9, 2011 (for dinner)<br></span></span></p>




<p><span class="adr">It seems that the name ‘Tomoya’ is really a compound of two Japanese words: Ya – for store or shop, and Tomo – meaning friend.<br></span></p>




<p><span class="adr">But, I don’t go to Tomoya for their Japanese food, though I do enjoy their spicy salmon sushi rolls ($5.95); I come for their Korean food.</span></p>




<p><span class="adr"><br></span></p>




<p><span class="adr">Like many non-AYCE “Japanese” restaurants in town, Tomoya is managed by Koreans, which is fine, because I have come to like Korean food a lot since coming back from a short visit to Korea many years ago (sadly, many Korean dishes often rely on generous amounts of garlic and onions, to which I sometimes suffer consequences from because of a mild food intolerance I have).<br></span></p>




<p>Many would probably say that the prices at Tomoya are a bit high, but I would compare it to the prices of Taka (Bleams+Strasburg). I am willing to pay $10 for their <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bibimbap" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">stone bowl (dolsot) bibibamp</a>, as I would say it’s equally good and similarly priced as Korean BBQ Restaurant in downtown, and much closer than downtown is for us.</p>









<p>The portion sizes always surprise me; you really get a pretty big serving of the Korean dishes (haven’t tried the Japanese, but the table next to us was raving about the chicken teriyaki and the Korean galbi/beef ribs). Furthermore, they seem to always give us miso soup and salad to start the meal, and some seasonal fruit to finish (pretty much regardless of what we order – watermelon this time, last time it was apples) – and this time even some kimchi to go with our Korean dishes (as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banchan" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">banchan</a>?)! They have limited selection of Korean dishes, but what they have is consistent, and tasty.</p>




<p>It appears that they have some lunch and monthly specials. I had my eye on the soon tofu stew ($8.50) but an <span id="result_box" class="short_text" lang="ko"><span class="hps" title="Click for alternate translations">아니오</span></span>﻿ from the kitchen confirmed that they only serve it during lunch hour. Instead, I opted for the monthly special, which was described as crystal noodles, but I know it as “<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japchae" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">japchae</a>” ($4.50). Because it was on the appetizer section of the menu (regularly $5.50), I didn’t actually expect much (in terms of portion size), so I ordered a roll to go with it. Was I ever wrong – the portion size is much bigger than expected, and would be perfect for someone with a lighter appetite, like myself!</p>









<p><span class="adr">It’s kind of sad to see them relatively empty every time we go, but I guess it is pretty much off the beaten path. It’s also somewhat unsettling to hear the microwave after you place your order (to defrost the meat??). The service is somewhat sparse, and maybe it’s a language barrier – but with so few customers, I can understand that they only really need one person to look after the tables.</span>﻿</p>




<p>I hope they’ll last and stick around, because it gives me one other option for non-AYCE sushi and Korean food! By the time I’m full, I’ve paid less than a meal at an AYCE place anyway.</p>




<p>And here’s a link to the only other blog review I managed to stumble upon on Google: Tomoya Japanese Bistro & Bar</p>

		<p>				<strong>June 2011 Update:</strong></p>




<p>Since the series of posts about a few sushi restaurants in town a few years ago, more and more all-you-can-eat (ayce) sushi options have been popping around the region – it’s almost to the point of oversaturation. Most of them have a dollar or two difference in weekday vs. weekend pricing.</p>




<p>Here are some of the choices:<strong></strong><strong></strong></p>




<ol><li><strong>Sushi Feast</strong>, Cambridge, ON – good tight rolls, small pieces that aren’t filled with rice. Points for presentation: sashimi and rolls are sometimes served in a sushi boat even. Probably is my first choice for fish and rolls. More expensive than most.</li>




<li><strong></strong><strong>﻿</strong><strong>Nara Sushi</strong>, Kitchener, ON – closer to us, decent overall, favourite is Nara Roll, which is made from rice paper instead of seaweed. Offers more unique cooked items like salmon belly. Beef ribs quite tender as well. My first choice for cooked items.<strong>﻿ </strong>It’s a nice bonus that carbonated drinks are included in the price, and that kids under 5 eat free. In terms of pricing, Sunday is considered a weekday.<strong><br></strong></li>




<li><strong>Sushi Boat</strong>, Kitchener, ON – close to Nara Sushi in terms of location, and a good alternative (non-similar options for their menu items, such as rolls with mango and kiwi). While some may say the menu offering is a bit smaller than others, the salmon sashimi has good texture, and even offers red tuna sashimi (though I didn’t much like the texture nor taste of it there).  The soups aren’t as salty as most places, but all the salads are lettuce based (instead of the pure seaweed for example). This one, unlike all of the others mentioned in this post has employees that also speak Cantonese, instead of just Mandarin or Korean. Has a VIP room for bigger groups. In terms of pricing, Sunday is considered a weekday.﻿ Children under 5 also eat free.<br><strong>Update</strong>: a visit two months later resulted in very poor quality rolls, mainly due to warm rice. The sashimi is still pretty decent though.<br><strong></strong></li>




<li><strong>Sakaye</strong>, Cambridge, ON – would not go for their rolls, but their Korean dishes are delicious. Their deep-fried items like tempura or potato croquette use the same batter. Sashimi (dinner) is hit and miss: salmon is good, tuna is somewhat mushy.</li>




<li><strong>Sushi 99</strong>, Waterloo, ON –<span style="text-decoration: line-through;"> I must admit, I have not tried their all-you-can-eat yet, but</span>Sushi 99’s AYCE is nothing to write home about, despite their extra choices for deep fried vanilla ice cream and cold creme brulee: the rolls have rice that is still warm, their kitchen dishes are okay (seafood pancake, green onion roll), but Nara Sushi seems to have better quality (kalbi/short ribs there are less fatty, and their salmon belly is less deep fried). Their a la carte option is good value and decent taste. e.g. Spicy salmon with avocado 8 piece roll $4.95, Chicken teriyaki meal ($9?) offers a good portion of meat with stir-fried vegetables on rice</li>




<li>As for <strong>Ye’s</strong>, Waterloo/Kitchener, and <strong>Sushi Star(s)</strong>, Kitchener, ON – used to go a lot more when it first opened, but now it doesn’t really stand out compared with the other choices. And I haven’t been to Ye’s Sportsworld Kitchener, Yummyaki (Korean-operated) in Waterloo, since it renovated, or Yummy’s (Waterloo, ON)</li>


</ol><p>We generally do not go to AYCE places for quality, just like we don’t generally go to chain restaurants for theirs either; it’s more for convenience (variety in a group setting that’s almost the same price as ordering an entree at a sit-down restaurant).﻿</p>




<p>So with that being said, the a la carte sushi rolls at <strong>Casa Mia</strong>, Waterloo, ON is probably one of the best in quality/taste around here!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.uptown21.ca" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Uptown21</strong></a><br>21 King Street South<br> Waterloo, ON<br> 519.883.1100<br>Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/NNUptown21" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@NNUptown21</a><br>Date of visit: June 7, 2011</p>




<p>After stumbling upon the book <em>Where to Eat in Canada</em> in Newfoundland some years ago, we have bought a copy of a later edition and discovered some places to try locally. Over the years, we have visited some on special occasions and this year, it just so happened that Tapas Tuesdays at Nick & Nat’s Uptown21 coincided with my birthday! So, we took the opportunity to try it.ï»¿</p>




<p>A friend asked me whether it was worth it, so here are my thoughts:</p>




<p>Serving time is from 5 to 9pm. We had a reservation at 5:30 pm and stayed pretty much until almost 8:30 pm. They’re really quick to bring you food until the tables start getting full (which by the way, seems to be always a full house so reservations a pretty much necessary on Tuesdays). Then, the food slows down, but it let’s you have time to digest and just enjoy, so not for those in a rush. We started to refer to each round of tapas as “levels” (like in a video game, the geeks that we are) since the breaks got longer in between (and fewer dishes) and we wanted to see how many we could try before we were full; the lamb and smoked pork poutine did it.</p>




<p><a title="IMG_9068 by b.p., on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aimeili/5811047294/"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3643/5811047294_c37dfa56b6_m.jpg" alt="IMG_9068" width="200" height="133"></a> <a title="IMG_9058 by b.p., on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aimeili/5810475225/"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5111/5810475225_1ea7beb562_m.jpg" alt="IMG_9058" width="200" height="133"></a></p>




<p>If you’re willing to dish out $35 (+tax, tip) for say another meal (like Summerlicious), then this is worth it. This type of eating suits the types of people who like trying new foods, and not for the types that aren’t as adventurous and need to know what they’re ordering, because you won’t get that there; the dishes change weekly, depending on what they have on hand. It’s more a meal <em>experience</em> instead of a quick sit-down meal.

At first, I had thought that maybe if more people went, you would get to try more dishes, but it doesn’t work like AYCE sushi; the portions pretty accurately reflect how many people are the table (which is nice since the portion sizes at sushi are usually the same regardless of the number of people). 

So if you do go, I’d recommend going as early as you can to minimize the wait time between “levels”/rounds of food.</p>




<p><a title="IMG_9052 by b.p., on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aimeili/5811035912/"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5200/5811035912_f382d32eda_m.jpg" alt="IMG_9052" width="200" height="133"></a> <a title="IMG_9098 by b.p., on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aimeili/5810488959/"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5264/5810488959_6a4a42bfda_m.jpg" alt="IMG_9098" width="200" height="133"></a></p>




<p>And as for me, I would go back and try it again – maybe for another special occasion.</p>

		<p>				The New Eve by Robert Lewis, which reminds me of the counterpart of “the quest for authentic manhood” series: biblical womanhood in modern society. Four chapters can be previewed online, of which I found interesting especially with the stat that a 33% of wives outearn their husbands (Lewis 5), and that 34% of men would consider staying home if their wives earned more money (31). Call me old fashioned, but if I was a guy, I may take issue with that; I would question my own competency.
And, to be honest, I’d probably be the Yia Yia in this commerical:
<iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/x9LinzE_85I" frameborder="0" width="560" height="349"></iframe>
The four chapters didn’t really answer my questions about the biblical view on child care, holding a career, and how it applies today; maybe I should contemplate on buying the book, since he’s already bought four.

<h3><strong>Restaurant</strong></h3>




<p>King Street Trio is back, back on King Street, but this time in Uptown Waterloo. A smaller spot than its previous two locations, but the atmosphere definitely fits in with the feel and vibe of Uptown Waterloo. This location used to be the Paper Tree, a small boutique specializing in different assortments of paper products, but if you didn’t know that you might not even know it was a retail shop before.</p>




<p>The wood adds warmth (and depth) to an otherwise industrial open concept kitchen and dining area. The details in the design is evident; even with the textured tiles on the washroom floors.</p>




<h3>Meal Choice</h3>




<p>King Street Trio offered a trial-run 3 course meal for $20, similar to conestoga dining room’s/bloom’s end-of-term dining method; we sampled a three-course meal by a somewhat random process. We had a group of 4, so we were able to try a variety of the menu items, some of which I have tried on their previous menus.</p>




<p><a title="IMG_8886 by b.p., on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aimeili/5618414964/"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5264/5618414964_bdc13b5fe1.jpg" alt="IMG_8886" width="400" height="266"></a></p>




<p>Verdict? Personally, I liked my meal the most compared to my dining companions’, but in all seriousness, if their presentation and quality of food keeps up, it’s heaps better than what King Street Trio on University was by the end of its run.﻿ It’s probably a place for special occasions than a daily option (for the budget conscious), or if I feel like having a great steak without needing to go to a steakhouse.</p>




<h3>Service</h3>




<p>Table service has never been a lack at King Street Trio; even if you do just order water, the servers always make sure your glass is full. Food did come out a bit later than expected, but I think that’s what the trial run is for, to work out food prep, seating, and other little nuances that you would not discover until you actually go through the motions (a great idea; much like a usability test!)</p>




<h3>Conclusion</h3>




<p>Aside from some “trial run” pains, but if they sort them out by opening day, it will be a great start.

Brian, the owner seemed to recognize most of their guests, so I told him that we read about the event in the local forums when he seemed surprised at our reservation. Definitely a busy first meal, as I didn’t get a chance to ask if he was the original owner of the King Street Trio in Kitchener…

Now, I can say that I’ve been to all three King Street Trios, including the original on King Street, Kitchener. This one doesn’t seem to have a permanent place for the live jazz; maybe that’s to come later, or maybe it’s a intentional move on their part, with a different restaurant vision in mind.

		<p>				I am a firm believer that a solid education can be shaped by the learning environment around you: good teachers and peers. I don’t remember much of what my teachers taught in elementary (aside from tees and tas in music class), but the teachers in high school indirectly influenced some of my habits today: Mr. Shiu’s lectures prompted the development of furious note-taking skills (and shorthand), and his “rules” are now embedded in my writing and editing at work, such as not ending sentences with a preposition or using ambigious referents (including the words “stuff” and “things”); Mr. Williams gave out mini chocolate bars every time we had a test – that certainly made exams less stressful, and I liked his teaching methods (for some reason, I still remember what the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoplasmic_reticulum" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">endoplasmic reticulum</a> looks like illustrated), and ended up taking at least 3 classes with him; Mr. Thompson encouraged me to not give up in math, despite my hating it (with much help from my mother). I was impressed that he was impressed at my mother’s ability to teach me how to solve the hardest questions, and when he found out that she majored in pure math, his next question was, “What does she do now?” I think he was expecting it was math related (does personal tutor count?).</p>




<p>In high school, I had hard-working and smart friends, which kept me working hard as well. In undergrad, friends who were older and wiser spent many hours patiently teaching me concepts I struggled with (computer science), which paid off because when we got to assembly language I understood it; another friend had actually taught me UNIX syntax in first year (for fun – at that point, I was more interested in hacking and computers more than course work); yet another friend even took the time to explain how to do matrices on the day of my exam (I got enough of it to figure it out for the exam). And, still another friend taught me latex for fun (can you tell that they’re all geeks?).</p>




<p>Some may say that good teachers are few and far between in university, but I must admit that I really enjoyed many of my upper year courses, so much so that I made all 8:30 classes, and skipping almost no classes (a stark contrast to first year). My current role in improving the user experience of web sites/applications has indirectly been a result of an information design course (or two?) I took with Professor Harris. Identifying split infinitives and ambigious referents was a perfect continuation from that class in high school with Mr. Shiu, in the two applied grammar courses with the current East Asian Studies director, J. Jewinski. And while I didn’t do as well in my computer science courses, I do recall J.P’s visual illustrations using Pez and a ferris wheel to illustrate FIFO, LIFO (and circular linked list) concepts. But, I never did get his name right or remember his favourite movie, for bonus marks.</p>




<p>My Korean professor makes this list of memorable classes and names. The first term I was only starting to get into the groove, but by the end of this term, he knew my name as I wasn’t afraid to ask questions (unlike me). Professor Kim clearly enjoys teaching. He has opportunities teach at UT but he drives from Scarborough once every week to teach at Renison, stays overnight at the residences and teachers another class before driving back. The day that WLU cancelled because of the snow storm? Well, it took him 4 hours to get to class. If he can make it, the students really have no reason not to show up. While we struggle to figure out what to study for the exams, his tangents are often philosophical in nature: “we make money to do what? to eat. we eat to make money.”</p>




<p>or as seen from my facebook status posts:</p>




<ul><li>“so turns out, korean guys laugh different than girls according to my prof! guys: 하하 (haha, first learned from @jameswyoon) and girls: 호호(hoho). then, there’s holding a laugh too?! 크크”</li>




<li>“love 101 in Korean 102: “I like the person” then respect then love then need…then marry﻿</li>




<li>“haha Korean prof recommended Song Cook’s too! (And a Soriwon?? 2 blocks north of there)”</li>




<li>﻿”新年快樂, 새해 복 많이 받으세요!﻿”</li>




<li>“woohoo, prof let us vote on the midterm date!”</li>




<li>﻿”Korean class = lessons in philosophy﻿”</li>




<li>“하하: the first two korean syllables i learned from james yoon. now, in korea101r, i’ve advanced to 안녕하세요…yay~ :p﻿”</li>


</ul><p>He even covered the basic etiquette of Korean dining: never pick up your bowl (unlike the Japanese and Chinese he says), and if you are served soup at the beginnig, you don’t drink it all right away; the host will only fill it up again if you do, as it is supposed to carry you through the meal. Anyway, at the end of this term, he arranged a special deal with a local Korean-Japanese restaurant where we would pay $15 for a customized buffet. Unfortunately, a few students didn’t show, and he had to cover for them himself! I’m crazy for even considering taking 201 next.</p>

		<p>				…with Facebook and Twitter available as a microblogging and social procrastination tool, the days of blogging have dwindled. In the last 10 years, the site has evolved from being hosted on geocities, uwaterloo.ca, to a paid host. In the process, I have played with tools like Dreamweaver and NotePad++, learned HTML and CSS, and the difference between the presentation and content layer.</p>




<p>For those who have followed for awhile, sheepie.net came about because of the offer of a free .net domain name for a year, which of course resulted in my paying to keep it thereafter. The eventual plan is to transition everything over to her.happyhippos.ca, which is in progress. Maybe eventually, I shall move to WordPress (and then add it proudly to my resume one day!).</p>




<p>This blog started pretty meaninglessly, and contained topics covering faith, school life, everyday life, but now I’ve noticed it really only covers major trips and reviews. Over the years, most of the real comments have come from people I know, with a couple of mysterious guests, like 0rc and Ann(e).</p>




<p>Let’s see if this blog lasts another 10 years. And what more appropriate than ending this post with the first-ever post that inspired me to blog: </p>




<blockquote>
Techie Blues |03.01.2001|



    If you think that it’d be cool to be up-to-date with every high-tech toy on the market, then consider this object lesson.



    If you don’t want to have a restful sleep, here is what you do. First you buy every communication device possible: mobile phone, PDA, pager. Next, make sure the pager is running low on batteries, and the mobile is set to “loud” mode and to receive i-fido text messages at 8:30 in the morning. Thirdly, the scheduled appointment on your PDA must be set so that the alarm is turned on to ring every 5 hours and the time set is for all day. Next, go to bed at 230 AM and be prepared to wake up at 1030 AM.



    Or should I say be woken up at all sorts of odd hours in the night? First, my PDA alarm goes off at 3 AM which I turn off. At 830 AM, my mobile beeps to notify me of the weather forecast of the day. Somewhere in between 3 AM and sunrise, my pager sounds an alarm to alert me that the batteries are low. At 1030 AM, my REAL alarm clock finally tells me to wake up.



    Due to cost-benefit reasons, I couldn’t throw my PDA across the room to tell it to let me have some peace, and my pager/mobile was too far away to reach. Somehow, my 8 hours of undisturbed sleep became an electronic nightmare. Thus, one of the many disadvantages of having so many high-tech toys . . . but there are many benefits too . . . just in case you wanted to get one 🙂

		<p>				Shortly before Christmas, I encountered a slight cold. Despite my cold, I was still well enough to travel; it was more of an annoyance than a bother. Yet, upon my return home on New Year’s Eve, I felt terrible: cold flashes at night (could be because I was sleeping in the basement freezing all night), followed by a headache, fatigue, and what felt like a fever coming on. Sad to say, I was the first to say goodnight shortly after the New Year’s countdown. On New Year’s day, I went to bed at 8PM, woke up in time for a great worship at a local Pentecostal church (more conservative that I think some of us think), and felt miserable for the rest of the week. By the time I saw the doctor, she said I had bronchitis, but told me that it is viral 85% of the time, and gave me the option of waiting it out, or filling the prescription for antibiotics. She actually vocalized what I had thought: that I had somehow caught two bugs. Well, as I told Tiff’s mom, God has blessed me with only one major flu a year, so this was it for 2010 and hopefully for 2011 (since it spanned over to 2011 as well) 🙂 (<a href="http://her.happyhippos.ca/worst-flu-ever">see 2009</a>).</p>




<p>I know it’s already March almost and I’ve only gotten to finishing this post now. Looking back, 2010 was a year full of mixed blessings. In no particular order:


</p><ul><li>Trips to <a href="http://her.happyhippos.ca/paris">Paris (February)</a>, <a href="http://her.happyhippos.ca/out-east">Nova Scotia and PEI (April)</a>, <a href="http://her.happyhippos.ca/visit-home">Vancouver (May)</a>, cross-border trips to Buffalo, <a href="http://her.happyhippos.ca/indianapolis">Indianapolis</a>, and local trips to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urMYAEbJ6RI" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Niagara Falls (July)</a>, Stratford (August), Port Stanley (September), <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aimeili/sets/72157624883990375/detail/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">New York and New Jersey (September)</a>, and ending the year in Boston (December).</li>




<li>Despite encouraging response to radiation and treatment, my uncle passed away suddenly in September. I believe that God knows when it’s our time, and somehow it coincided with my parents’ visit, so that they did not have to go twice. In the end, all of us had a chance to spend time with his family and it was good seeing them after this many years, despite the sad circumstances.</li>




<li>At work, I switched teams, which allowed for more UX design opportunities. Different challenges, but refreshing.</li>




<li>I lost my diamond. I had happened to look down at my ring, and noticed that 2 of my claws were broken and was left with a gaping hole in my ring. I believe in the power of answered prayer, and recalling how God answered BAC’s pastor Isaac’s prayer for finding lost keys and my prayers for finding the counsellor’s engagement ring among a grassy field, I had high hopes that He would hear my prayer. And hear and answer He did! Despite my travel from Waterloo (to the store) to Toronto that day, I just walked back to the car, opened my car trunk and voila, it was just sitting there gleaming against the black fabric.</li>




<li>Four set of our friends tied the knot as well 🙂</li>


</ul><p>Let’s see what God has in store for us in 2011.</p>
