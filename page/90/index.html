Let me elaborate and give you some examples (in response to Pearlo’s comment):
</p>



<p>


</p><ol><li>If you have read my opinion <a href="javascript:OpenWindow('relationships.html')">piece</a> on Christians dating non-Christians in either Insight or from my website, you know where I stand on ppl who do it, and sadly, I’ve seen consequences as a result of doing so…say that I had a friend who is in that situation, and I tell them that I don’t think it’s right, and side with her family that the guy she’s seeing is totally tearing her time away from God and from who she could be, and she gets hurt by that…well, I may feel sorry (bad) for hurting her, but not exactly too sorry for telling her what I feel. I know that I’d also do it again, maybe not to this particular friend, but with other people.</li>




<li>
Consider this, if I find out that a fellow sister in Christ is engaged and soon to be married with her long-time boyfriend,  I wouldn’t be sorry that I asked others about them, because it’s supposed to be a happy occasion, but I guess I’d feel sorry if the sister was hurt because they didn’t want anyone to know to begin with–but I instead found out from a friend who told me when I asked about them. I also know that I will continue to ask people I know well how others are doing and their status, if I don’t know the other party well. For, from personal experience, it is quite embarassing and awkward to have someone ask me indirectly, “So, how are you and Ben doing?” when that was in the past a year and a half ago. I’d rather them find out from others . . .However, I guess some people don’t feel the same, so I’d be sorry for offending that particular person, but not for asking others.</li>




<li>
Imagine that you have a friend (or sibling! :P),  of whom you see 24/7: you go to church, live, and work (w/in 1 metre or less) with him/her, so it would be understandable if you’d want some distance. You try to communicate that on multiple occasions that you’d like distance (not that you dislike him or her though) and it’d only be understandable if you’d want some own time with your friends (which so happen to be his/her friends too at times). So, the only last resort is to move out, which surprisingly enough, works a little too well. Thus, you might end up being sorry for compromising whatever friendship there ever was, but not exactly sorry for what you did because it did help accomplish the healthy distance that was needed in that relationship.
</li>




<li>Turning the table onto you, would you feel sorry to have fallen out of love with someone (and thus, hurting them) and perhaps become slightly interested in someone else, to which both events are mutually exclusive and to whom you end up spending the rest of your life with, all in a matter of a short period of time?</li>


</ol>


Hrm. Some of this reasons of not feeling sorry for the action are quite selfish, but are sometimes necessary, in my opinion.  Ah wellz. Anyhow, yeah…time for class!




<p>
OH one more thing, I am SOOOOO O_o because my program doesn’t require us to do an intensive concentration area anymore (5 courses in an area other than English) – we can take up to 13 open electives! If I don’t have my CS minor, then my CS courses go down the drain (instead of twd my “intensive concentration”, which sounds so much more “high and mighty” than “open electives”). boooo.</p>

		<p>				modrobes because I certainly don’t want <i>you</i> to get into my pants…’tho I’ve been in J’s…literally…but a long story and I digress…


</p><p>
You know, I was lookin’ fer a pair of bright red flares by Modrobes since the summer, but Athletes World always sold it for either $39.99 or on sale for $29.99, but i figured them to be too expensive. Thus, this time, when i saw them for $24.99, I couldn’t resist and promptly bought ’em. Actually, this item was one of the two things on my Christmas wish list, so I’m claiming it as a gift from my grandma in HK. =). Vonne, GK, and many others thinks that they’re too bright, but at least it matches my Swiss Army bag. kekeke. And, both my mom and sis like it :). Well, if you want to see it, find it on my fotos page–I actually like the pic b/c it’s quite a fun one. The style is similar to this <a href="javascript:OpenWindow('http://www.radicalplanet.com/start/images/2hip_large2.jpg')">one</a>.
</p>



<p>
The other day, I received an e-mail that was a rather funny <a href="javascript:OpenWindow('spam.html')">spam</a>. Firstly, I was addressed as a “sir”, and secondly, the rhetoric behind the writer’s plea isn’t very persuasive at all. Tho’ I am persuaded to reply and see what happens…tho’ I’d likely get more e-mails from him and secondly, get scammed.
</p>



<p>
I wish I knew Mandarin. As I went for Chinese groceries with PT on Saturday (in which I ended up driving his minivan (since he picked up the church bus) on the trip back which was a very interesting experience since I’ve never driven one before and the fact dat he actually trusts my driving skills…), a lady came up to me and tho’ she looked familiar, I couldn’t pinpoint who she was. She just approached me and eagerly spoke to me in Mandarin. I did not catch a single word! AH! Possibly because I wasn’t fully at her attention, but also because she spoke waay too fast. So, I just gave her this “look”, and proceeded to say, “wo(3) bu(4) jiang(3) guo(1) yu(3); wo(3) jiang(3) guong(3) dong(1) hua(4)” with my poor speaking skills. Her look was like, “oh! but I don’t speak Cantonese”. Yes. i’ve never actually spoke to her in Mandarin before, so I have NOOOO idea where she got the impression that I knew Mandarin. Shopping in a Chinese store doesn’t guarantee that one knows Chinese. Well, I soon found out that she was asking me about ESL stuf because I work at the LangLab and I see her every Monday when she attends the ESL class…but, I don’t even know her name…
</p>



<p>
Tania asked me today, who I write my journals for. I told her that it’s both for me and for others I guess, since I’m so useta writing it for that purpose. My parents and my teachers in elementary school made us write daily journals — either on a topic or on what we did. So, I’m useta doing that I suppose…
</p>



<p>
Btw, Caleb told me write that he is da best! =) Dun ask me why, he just is. Period.<br>

<li><a href="#local">The art of eavesdropping</a></li>





<a name="hp">After three failed attempts, I have <i>yet</i> to see Hairy Pots. Sunday’s show was sold out at Galaxy. We could’ve beat the system too because there was a database flaw :). There were only 2 tickets left, but we were able to order “4” while making simultaneous purchases on 2 different consoles, but we couldn’t communicate to the purchaser at the 3rd machine in time because we needed 6, and then, a couple bought it. Boo.


<p>
<a name="fire">I heard that on Sunday, my housemate, GK, set the stove on fire. Well, apparently, she accidently poured oiled into the stove pan and flames licked all the way up to the top of the fan. My other housemate’s bf, an ex-pyromaniac, quickly poured the whole Brita onto the flames. You and I are likely taught that water is never to be used for grease fires, correct? Apparently, if the water to oil ratio is higher (ie more water than grease), it’s as effective as pouring sand or using a fire extinguisher–not that we have any of the latter items. Thankfully, the fire was contained, else I’d be soo sad if my Pound Puppy was gone :P.


<p>
<a name="power">Two nights ago at about 4:30 AM, I just saved my work before I was suddenly left in the dark. I wandered outside my room and GK, “What just happened?”. The lights were ever so bright in the buildings across from us, but we had no electricity! Not being able to do anything in pitch darkness (well, with a “press-and-hold” GM light that Jason gave me do to parking checks), I ended up resigning to bed. Oh well, that was likely a good thing because otherwise, I would’ve gotten less sleep. On the other hand, GK took her notebook, went to school, and never came back until the next afternoon…


<p>
<a name="local">I overheard a conversation the other day:<br><i>A couple is seated at the dinner table and before starting their meal…</i><br>
[Bf]: Why were you just praying?<br>
[Gf]: No! Why would I be praying?<br>
[Bf]: You looked like you were praying.<br>
[Gf]: You’re crazy!


<p>
The most interesting thing is I do believe that at one point in her life, the girl would say grace before meals.  Her bf, is obviously not one and by his incredulous tone, he does not think highly of Christianity. Reminds me of my years in elementary and high school where prayers of thanksgiving before meals were heartlessly fired up to God in a blink of an eye.
</p>



<p>
On the topic of prayer: please continue to pray for my friend in her quest for Truth. She’s now attending fellowship, church, Sunday School, and even cell group with much interest! And for my other friend, that she will find meaning in life and to be able to feel, embrace, and to be set free by God’s love.</p>

Me: Normal?! [Glances at the stove clock] it’s 4:15 a.m. …

<p>
Interesting to see what our house defines what time bedtime is… I don’t think we actually have a concept of bedtime. :þ

<p>
Was gonna see HP today (a private screening!) but PT cancelled b/c his friend was busy. Must’ve been a busy opening night. D’oh. Hopefully soon 🙂</p>

Over the past weekend, I think I had the chance to realise how Jesus (and possibly mothers) felt in the area of compassion for people that he didn’t know (well, Jesus, being God did, but I use “know” reciprocally). I was reminded to pray for a distant friend once again. I could feel my heart breaking for this 19-year old, who is so full of potential and ambition, whose friends and  parents love her, and yet has somehow ended up on the road to self-destruction and trouble. God <i>must</i> have a purpose for her even though she says that her “church is overated”–I pray that someday she’ll see Him and be released from what enslaves her inner being…which reminds me (actually it was <a href="http://ericairis.blogspot.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Erica</a> who indirectly reminded me through her blog entry)…inwardly, that weekend was quite emotion-filled. Vonne asked me after Lifesong how I felt over Soap’s testimony, and I just kinda *shrugged*–rather useta or expectant of the rhetoric of such a night (and not to mention that one of my closer friends back home faced a similar struggle of coping and healing). However, instead of feeling upset or angry at the offender, all I felt was sadness. The same feeling of sadness for the friend who came over for a few hours on Sunday. I guess that’s where compassion also ties in–I felt sad that these people did/do not have freedom from whatever had/has a hold on them; freedom, which comes from a personal relationship with God, through Jesus Christ. Oddly, I am reminded me of <a href="javascript:OpenWindow('tears.html')">a poem</a> I wrote back in Grade 9.
</p>



<p>
BTW, does anyone know how to fix <a href="javascript:OpenWindow('error.JPG')">this</a> error? Oh, I’ve tried to update my driver w a full reinstall and even tampered w the BIOS…sometimes my computer can go for days w/o crashing, but other times, on boot, it freezes and shuts me down b/c of this error…*sigh*.</p>

Interestingly enough, Soap touched upon a very good pt on forgiveness and how hard it is…as much as I’d like to say that I  forgive everyone very easily, I am experiencing the challenges first-hand even with Christians. I thought about it yesterday evening in the shower before even I knew what Soap was going to talk bout it! I realise that as much as I don’t get along with someone, it’s not very fair to bring past negative experiences into the picture as I’d be even more biased in my thinking, and it would only make me only more angry and/or bitter.

<p>
Ah, I think I will sleep earlier tonight. All those crazy all-nighters I pulled while helping out with Lifesong this week has really caught up with me! Goodnite :).</p>

Made a few updates to this page: took out the poll (it’s wasting space right now), updated piQ of day (realised a more convenient way to post thumbnails by directly linking to the source instead of having to save the image and upload it to my server), and added <a href="http://www.xanga.com/sillypearly" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sillypearly</a> back to my list of “frequent” bloggers (she’ll be happy to know) :). To those “new” readers: typing “impromptu.sheepie.net” in your browser will take you directly here instead of having to go to my “thoughts” page.</p>
