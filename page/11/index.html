		<p>				Firsts


Little Bean had her first airplane adventure! It* almost seems coordinated that all the babies and toddlers were situated close together on the first flight. Great for isolating noise, but I’m sure it wasn’t fun for the non-parents in our immediate vicinity. Perhaps it was a combination of late flying, teething, and ear pressure, but the second leg resulted in a more cranky (and thus, crying) baby than the first. We tried baby Tylenol on the return trip, and perhaps that, in addition to daytime flying, resulted in a calmer and happier baby, who even smiled at fellow passengers and interacted with them (so yes, we drugged our child; my mother told us she used to use Dimetapp on us…)
We also discovered that she really likes babies, in addition to other young’uns and adults. While her first visit to the church nursery was met with tears (and thus, an early pick up and nap in the <a href="http://www.mamankangourou.com/en/product/asiatik--mei-tai-type" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mamankangarou</a>**), she would actively want to touch her baby cousin and play with her newfound friends (including those in Seattle, a first US visit for her)! Just showing her baby cousin perked her up right away from being grumpy (resulted from  being woken up early to catch our return flight home); she even started socializing with the toddler behind us on our flight home.  A fun afternoon for the mommies (chatting and taking photos) and her first playdate with her newfound friend led me to discover that she’s ready for the “walker-turned-exersaucer-that-has-no-saucer-or-wheels” contraption as well (a quick Google search tells me that the Baby Einstein brand calls it the “Musical Motion Activity Jumper”). This I will miss dearly: the opportunity to watch her grow up with her cousin and the children of my friends back home.
Other milestones:


</p><ul><li>While her bite was a tad sharp last month, the first tooth on her bottom left is finally poking through</li>


    

<li>I didn’t realize she has been able to sit without support until I saw a photo on Facebook of her playing with a giant banana. This wasn’t the case just a week earlier at her playdate…!</li>


    

<li>Sleep (and its challenges): We managed to wean her from being swaddled at night while she slept in a pack n’ play bassinet. However, she tended to scooch over to the edge every time and mash her face against the mesh or bury it in the crib sheet. I suspect that’s because she likes her face / lip against something, which is in line to what she does in her car seat as well. This has not translated well when transitioning her back into the crib – my theory is that it’s too “open” and she doesn’t like it. On a related note, a friend asked me what was one of the biggest lessons I learned as a new parent, and I had to say do whatever it takes for your baby to sleep. A doula gave me one advice that worked wonders: find out and remove the stimulus/stimuli that prevents her from sleeping and she may have an easier time of sleep even on the go! (answer: visual stimuli)</li>


    

<li>The day after we returned, she developed a 1-day fever; it was sad times almost all day for all – even the digital thermometer had a sad face. We are so happy to see the happy Little Bean again</li>


    

<li>(not really 7 month related, but…) apparently vomit happens a lot to many babies, at least that’s what the friendly sales lady at a local baby store said. She was surprised to learn that it was Little Bean’s first time, at the tail end of her 6 months. We were just thankful that nothing landed on the demo glider that Daddy was sitting in</li>


</ul><hr>
*The “It” at the beginning of the sentence greatly bothers me because it’s an ambiguous referent, but I haven’t found a better way to rephrase it
** The stretchy  meitai carrier was the best $21 spent on a baby item by the way. Though, we tried the travel / performance ergo baby that my sister has: it’s super comfy and convenient – which is probably worth the investment especially for treks like snowshoeing (her first time with us as well on this trip!), though it costed 3x more. We have an older, original ergobaby carrier hand-me-down, but I’m questioning its authenticity at the moment.]]>

		<p>				Solids


Month six brings a major change in Little Bean’s daily routine (and yes, <em>routine</em> is important; it makes or breaks a good day): the introduction of “solid” food. At her six month check-up, the doctor asked if she had started to sit tripod-style (yes), transfer objects from one hand to another (kind of?), and put everything in her mouth (doctor said that other parents would be envious that she only puts her fingers in her mouth). While her weight is still on the lower percentile of the graph, her length is back to being average, but maybe we have a late bloomer, because a few days later, she decided to gum everything. Ah, one of the signs that she’s ready for solids!
We started her a week late, which happened to coincide with Chinese New Year, and while she immediately took a liking to rice cereal (store-bought: <a href="http://well.ca/products/baby-gourmet-organic-brown-rice_61839.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Baby Gourmet</a> which only has soy lecithin in addition to fortified nutrients, compared to other commercial rice cereals that have ingredients such as vanilla and other random additives), her face told us that she wasn’t expecting mashed avocado in place of it, when we introduced that to her next. However, a consequence of a new diet means stinkier and more explosive diapers.


</p><h2>Cloth diapers</h2>


We wouldn’t have tried using cloth diapers had our friends not lent us some Bum Genius diapers. At first, the diapers would leak but I soon realized it was because she was still too small for them, but the diapers have advanced since I last remembered them in my childhood days. Gone are the muslin cloths and safety pins, and in their place are “hook and loop” closures (aka velcro), diaper inserts, liners, and material that wicks (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyurethane_laminate" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PUL</a>).  We haven’t used them out yet, as they’re not as convenient as disposables, but I have the sense that the cloth diapers are more breathable on her bum.
It helps to have friends who also use cloth diapers as I’ve come across some tips from them and on the internet, in no particular order:


<ul><li>Breastfed babies diapers are the easiest to manage, as you can just throw everything in the wash, without needing to rinse or flush.</li>


    

<li>Because the diapers are now very absorbent, I sometimes can’t smell it, but the guideline of changing her every 2-3 hours is a good window, as the diaper is almost always wet within that timeframe.</li>


    

<li>Stains that still remain after a wash can disappear with sun exposure, even if it has gone through the dryer.  Yes, something magical happens with UV rays and removing stains! Now I understand why people dry their laundry outdoors, in addition to getting a nice fresh breeze through them. However, with the cold and snow, I’ve resorted putting them next to the window, and over a course of a few days, sure enough, the stains fade! However, a couple of friends also recommend using <a href="http://www.bunchafarmers.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">buncha farmers all-natural stain remover</a>, so I will try that next time and the residual stains from her explosion on her clothes too.</li>


    

<li>My friend suggested a more economical way to catch poop in the diaper, so to save on having to rinse it before washing: line a soft paper towel between the diaper and babe’s bum – or better yet, Charmin extra strong supposedly does the trick too.</li>


</ul><h2>Teething</h2>


In other news, Little Bean IS teething – no teeth is poking out yet, but I put my finger in her mouth the other night, and felt something sharp on her left. She had woken up wailing and the usual tricks to lull her back to sleep consistently failed until another friend suggested using baby Advil to help her with the pain. Well, we had baby Tylenol instead, and it sure is effective; she went back to sleep within 15 minutes!


<hr><em>What would new parents </em>(I)<em> do without the internet? </em>I’ve vocalized this to older moms, and they told me that they had support groups of other moms to lean on, or they just had to rely on information passed down from their parents. {If I had to rely on that, the diet of solid foods would be drastically different (e.g. egg white introduced separately than yolks, avoidance of peanuts, strawberries, and other potential allergens until after 1 years of age, which the recommendation now is not to wait)}<em></em>]]>

After scrolling through everything, here’s what caught my eye:


</p><ol><li>Facebook is my top referer (through sharing individual posts to my friends on Facebook)</li>


    

<li>I’m not sure if I’ve discouraged search engines to index my site since the start, but it’s somewhat strange to see that the top search referral is, “ntcbc deacon administrative leave” especially because I don’t have a post about that. And because I see it now, I guess there was an incident that must have been a big deal (bigger than I thought)</li>


    

<li>If we counted my top fans from commenters alone, Lawrence gets the award. But yes, I know that there are lurkers among you as well, so thanks 🙂</li>

</p><h3>Kefir</h3>


After a recent trip to the farm, the hosts gave me some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kefir" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">kefir</a> grains to try cultivating, when I expressed some remote interest and enthusiasm that they’ve been making homemade kefir. Grace first introduced me to store-bought effervescent kefir, served with a homemade rhubarb compote, and I returned to it recently when I saw it for 50% off at the grocery store. Then, I bought the non-effervescent one for regular price (which goes for $3.5/946ml = $very pricey in my books), when I read that kefir is a yogurt-like drink that has three major things going for it:


<ol><li>It is low in lactose (for the [somewhat] lactose-intolerant, like myself)</li>


    

<li>It is high in calcium (1 serving = 30%)</li>


    

<li>It is high in probiotics, thought to contain more than yogurt itself</li>


</ol><h3>Homemade Kefir</h3>


When sampling their homemade version, more things came to mind:


<ol><li>This tastes nothing like the store-bought variety; as Stephanie succinctly put it, it has strong flavours of yogurt+beer</li>


    

<li>This smells nothing like the store-bought variety; it smells like yeast</li>


    

<li>Milk can be “stored” in room temperature? (I guess with kefir, it can?)</li>


    

<li>What? They bought the kefir grains from kijiji? I didn’t realize that a) they were that tech-saavy (!), and b) shady-much?</li>


    

<li>This brought me back to a faint childhood memory: I had a fizzy strawberry milk drink when I was in kindergarten at a classmate’s house. I had always wondered if it was just an East Indian drink consisting of sprite+strawberry milk, but maybe it’s a version of kefir?</li>


</ol><h4>Observations</h4>


As I experimented with kefir this week, I came across these findings:


<ol><li>Store-bought kefir doesn’t smell like homemade kefir because it doesn’t contain yeast</li>


    

<li>The smell of yeast in homemade kefir is stronger than it should taste (should taste more sour than yeasty)</li>


    

<li>There is a very brief window of when kefir is ‘ready’ before it turns into kefir curds and whey. When it’s ‘ready’, it has a milder flavour (less beer-like) and has a more similar consistency to store-bought kefir, which is looking to be around the 12 hour mark with my proportions of milk to grain and the surrounding environment.</li>


    

<li>My sudden intake of kefir may or may not have affected the change in smell of breastfed baby’s bowel movements (yeastier! *tmi, i know)</li>


    

<li>As I tended to this micro-organism/bacterial colony, I couldn’t help but think that cultivating kefir grains is similar to cultivating our seed of faith – our relationship with God; you have to tend to it, for it to grow and as a result, multiply.</li>


</ol><h4>Comparisons</h4>


So, while I wasn’t giving some breast milk to my friend, I suppose kefir is similar to breast milk, in that:


<ul><li>they both contain plenty of nutrients</li>


    

<li>both can differ in taste and texture, depending on the stage it’s at (or time of day)</li>


    

<li>and both are sometimes referred to as ‘liquid gold’ (see <a href="https://www.google.ca/search?q=kefir+%22liquid+gold%22" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">kefir</a> vs. <a href="https://www.google.ca/search?q=breastmilk+%22liquid+gold%22" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">breast milk</a>)</li>


</ul>


I tend to have a black thumb when it comes to plants, so we’ll see if they will survive for an extended time. If you’re brave to try the end product, let me know and I’d be happy to share.

		<p>				sniff. To be honest, I’m a little reluctant to want her to grow up, because it means three Ms:
more mobile, meal planning, and messy meals – and thus, more care and less time!
This month, I have finally gotten back to playing badminton – and wow, my muscles felt so tight when I lunged to reach for the birdie at first, but at the end of the night, I felt good. In Little Bean’s world, she has re-discovered her love for sucking on her two fingers (must be very tasty), and she can now repeatedly roll herself over from back to front, and on occasion from front back. But, like many things, this happens only when you’re not looking. If we had a weekly theme, this week’s would be: blowing bubbles. Pfffffpht sounds. While it makes for even more drool, at least it’s helping her form P and Th/B syllables for later use 😉 I also realized that j.w didn’t know that she is very helpful with diaper changes because he would always hold her legs up when changing her diapers, but whenever I change her diaper, she helps mommy by lifting up her legs and keeping it there until you put a diaper on her.
And here’s a short clip of her pffffts to end off this post:

</p><li>I didn’t know the power had went out around 1am, but around that time, we had moved Little Bean’s playard/make-shift-crib away from the window wall as I didn’t want her to feel cold from the window draft. Good thing we did, as it would’ve been very cold for her to sleep otherwise without heat.</li>


	

<li>J.ws’ place had a gas stove, so in the morning, jopoo made us all some hot coffee and an omelette breakfast (using a flame to start the gas stove)</li>


	

<li>Cars were not damaged by fallen branches, but our car was stuck in the garage as the only way in aside from the powered chain was through the side door, to which no one had keys for. However, jonny graciously swapped cars with us so that we could get back to KW</li>


	

<li>Despite missing church in the morning (in spite of attempts to get there), we were able to take refuge at j.w’s parents’ place for the day, as the other house had no power, and thus heat</li>


	

<li>The church Christmas dinner was not cancelled as the restaurant had power, so everyone gathered there that night and shared a filling meal</li>

…that was the first thing the Registered Dietitian said to me. She then said that it would be very difficult to eat that many calories, so to make it up, she suggested that I drink a fruit+diary smoothie before bed every night; it was that or drink a bottle of Ensure before bed (which isn’t the economical or tastier method as 6 of them can be around $13). She was happy to agree that coconut milk would be good in my smoothie too. When asked for a hot drink alternative, she suggested Ovaltine. In addition, she prescribed 2 <em>tablespoons</em> of molasses a day, and suggested eating red meat at least 2-3 times a week. I didn’t know why at first, but apparently molasses is high in nutrients, including iron which is good for me and baby (I’ve always been on the lower side – but not anemic).
So, basically, I have to unlearn everything they teach you about not eating before bed, and about staying away from whole milk, juices and sweets. Perhaps part of the reason why weight gain is slow as molasses for me is because I don’t really have an affinity to sweet-sweets, including Ovaltine. I find 100% OJ is too sweet for me too at times, and will dilute it with water. The hand-out package she passed along, had advice that many people would be happy to follow, especially the first line below:


<blockquote>Eat high calorie desserts like ice cream, cakes, pies, cookies and sweets…
Choose juice, milk or milkshakes instead of low-calorie fluids like water, tea, broth or coffee…
Add extra butter to toast, bread, and crackers…
Drink whole milk and use whole milk products.
Choose cream soups. Spread mayonnaise on sandwiches or crackers…
Add extra oil to stir-fry vegetables or meat…</blockquote>


…maybe I should try <a href="http://www.thekitchn.com/whats-the-deal-with-butter-in-coffee-190911" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">butter coffee</a> too, sometime.
And to make eating two tablespoons of molasses easier, I have resorted to putting it in the smoothie or in my own blend of hot chocolate (blend of Laura Secord all natural, 5-ingredient hot chocolate base – thanks to the Lus – with added Trader Joe’s cocoa powder, milk, ginger powder, nutmeg, cinnamon, and now molasses). When I asked if I could incorporate it into baking, she didn’t think that was a terrific idea, as I would need to eat all of what I baked in a day, like a dozen of gingerbread cookies; I can see how gross that might feel. I did also learn that if I had non-animal protein, like edamame, I should pair it with food that has vitamin C in it, so that the protein is absorbed properly (like OJ, kiwi, strawberries). In terms of ideas for good fruit in the winter season, she admitted that there isn’t much but to try frozen fruits instead as the nutrients is sometimes preserved better due to flash freezing. I forgot to ask what my target weight should be, but I guess if I get back to pre-pregnancy weight that would be a start. She didn’t cover avocado and fish with me this time, but thanks to our local Sobeys, fatty fish finds (for a fabulous price) are a weekly event now. Time to stock up on these foods, even though it may mean paying more, like for kefir and maybe a trip to Eby Farm for their <a href="http://www.ebymanor.ca/our-products" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Golden Guernsey cream top whole milk</a> too.  I just hope j.w won’t gain too much weight if he comes along for the ride at times too!  /88]]>

</p><li>My manager told me she developed carpal tunnel syndrome while she was on mat leave; I didn’t quite believe her as I had attributed it to her use of her smartphone. But, while I didn’t have any symptoms during my pregnancy (which is more common), apparently getting the hang of breastfeeding took a toll on my wrists early on – at least that’s what I think. Anyway, the doctor told me it happens and diagnosed the right wrist as having ulnar neuropathy and the left wrist as having De Quervain’s Tenosynovitis</li>


	

<li>Little Bean started to become more responsive: she would laugh or smile at random words or phrases, starting with: “Excuse me/you!”, then “farfale” (a type of pasta), and moving to “squishy” and hearing me sing “Shake a friend’s hand, shake a hand next to you” while shaking her hand up and down. The alphabet song continues to be a great go-to song to calm her down.</li>


	

<li>All my regular pants are now too lose. It’s true: breastfeeding burns calories! I feel like I have more of an appetite than during pregnancy (I actually wasn’t very famished often then, as the weight of the baby probably helped me feel “full”). Today, when I weighed myself at the doctor’s office, I thought the scale was broken, so I grabbed a nurse and asked her to show me how to use the scale, and she read when I saw, which unfortunately, means that I weigh less now than my pre-pregnancy weight, which is very disconcerting. I remember losing 10lbs due to suspected H1N1 flu, and I never did gain it back until pregnancy, but my weight now is even lower than that, like maybe at the same weight as my early teen years.</li>


	

<li>Phantom cries and pushing an empty stroller (or one with groceries), or rocking from side to side, despite not carrying her. I was amused to hear from a doula that I’m not alone on these experiences.</li>





For me, I recognize that the fourth trimester is over when I see a bunch of hair fall out every time I shower (sadly, I’m losing the luscious locks that I grew during pregnancy)! For her, wake up she has.  Now, you can tell that she enjoys interacting with you, whether it’s her gaze that follows you, or the expressions she makes. I’ve read that they become more social during feeds, and I didn’t understand what that meant until I realized that she discovered her hands and is now exploring: reaching for and touching or grabbing at my shirt, hair, face and even glasses while nursing, which means she is more easily distracted as a result (she also turns her head to look at Daddy if she hears or see him nearby, and thus interrupting her feed as well). She has also just started to reach up and grab the toys above her during playtime, and she attempted to sit with support on the bumbo chair. Tummy time is easier now when she’s alert, but as a result of exploring the world, putting her down for nap time is often a slight struggle, with her mantra cry before settling down/soothing herself to sleep. Napping while out, unless being pushed in a stroller on a bumpy sidewalk, is especially difficult, but at night, she sleeps an average of 5 hour stints +/-1 hour, which literature defines as “sleeping through the night”, though after her 4mo immunization shots, she actually surprised us by sleeping for 9 hours straight!  Mommy and Daddy are savouring this stage of life, as we have our evenings back, and she’s just a good baby overall. #PraiseGod
Milestones: 12 lbs, 25.6 in, 16.1 HC = this translates as being 85 percentile in length/height, but only 10 percentile in weight (takes after her mother in this area, perhaps?)]]>

Now that I’m on maternity leave, and spend most of my time at home (which I don’t actually mind), one of the most commonly asked questions is, “What do you do all day?”
My inner voice might have interpreted the question as, “What do you do with all this free time you have now?”, to which my mind would retort, “Free time? What free time?”
I can just imagine a conversation going like this:


</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>You:</strong> What do you do all day?
<strong>Me:</strong> What do <em>you</em> do all day?…Work? Right.</p>


If you asked me what I used to do at work all day, I must tell you that I didn’t work all day. Of the 8 hours, my day would be broken up with many meetings to attend, emails to respond to, questions to answer or consult on…and when I do actually have time to do assigned or actual “work”, it’s in pieces and starting and stopping just breaks it up even more. Of course, time is also spent on social interactions with colleagues, bio breaks, and filling my empty stomach.
Likewise, my day begins when j.w leaves for work and for the most part, ends when he returns. So, like most of the workforce, I look forward to evenings and weekends to unwind. My meetings are with her: feeding, changing diapers, and work is spending time to help her progress developmentally; we have time for fun, whether it’s tummy time, reading to her, or socializing with the world. Social interactions, bio breaks, and filling my empty stomach happens when she is content in her ‘poo’ chair (chair that she happens to ‘go’ in often, but also to sit in and watch mommy cook or empty the dishwasher), playing in her playmat, or napping. Though, naps also allow me to get some chores done (baby laundry especially) and sometimes, if I’m super tired, I will squeeze in a power nap too.
I’m blessed that my husband, when he comes home from a full day’s of work, will take over baby duties, including sharing father-daughter time, bathing her and starting her bedtime routine while I finish up cooking. And sometimes, he even takes her out to the Kitchener Market on Saturday mornings so that I can sleep in! We’re thankful that she sleeps early so that we both have a full evening to ourselves to relax a bit before the next cycle repeats the following day.
So what do I do all day? Like work, there are good and bad days, but for the most part, every day is a different and new day!
