        53. For, in verse 10, the NIV says, “<i>He came to that which was
        his own, but his own did not receive him,</i>” which seems to echo verse
        3 of Isaiah 53: “<i>He was despised and rejected by men, a man of sorrows,
        and familiar with suffering. Like one from whom men hide their faces he
        was despised, and we esteemed him not.</i>“]]>		</p>

		<p>				 In reality, my grandmother (on my father’s side) isn’t so fortunate.
          Just recently found out that she has approximately 6 months to live
          due to cancer on spleen, kidney, and liver. I guess I just request prayers
          for her especially for peace and comfort in dealing with the pain associated
          with cancer and for her family. Her husband passed away 2 Christmases
          ago, so I guess she’s quite lonely in HK. Thankfully, some of her sons
          + extended family will be able to visit her throughout this time. And,
          she’ll be meeting God soon…after 82 years… Hrm, I guess I’m not
          really that sad because she has something to look forward to…and her
          salvation is in the Lord afterall!
        </p>



<p> Onto lighter topics: Just the other day, I went grocery shopping w
          Jesse and Waymun (well, that’s not really his name but anyhow :P) and
          I was suddenly craving for seafood (see? food!), but well, I wasn’t
          really in the vincinity of BC waters anymore, but something caught my
          eye…two fish for $0.91?? How can that be possible!? Well, I had no
          idea what “Salt Herring” was, and neither did Waymun. I suspected that
          it was from salt waters and previously frozen. At the back of my mind,
          it also occured to me that it could have been salted at one point since
          the expiry date wasn’t until Feb03. Anyhow, Waymun rationalised that
          since it was less than one dollar, if the fish proved to be gross, we
          could afford to throw it out. Following his reasoning, I took a package.
        </p>



<p> Imagine my surprise, when upon steaming it, I tasted a bit of it and
          experienced “Ham Yu”. hahaha. the joys of cooking. Thankfully, I was
          also making snowpeas so I just stirred the rest of it into the peas
          and “low fan” with it. Twas quite edible actually :)…so now, I have
          one more fish sitting in the freezer waiting to be made into “Ham Yu
          Gai Lup Fan” (Salted fish with chicken pieces fried rice?). Lesson of
          the day? “Salt Herring” is literally “Ham Yu”. And, Waymun’s fish? I
          have yet to ask him how his dish went…:)
        </p>



<p> Speaking of food, I’m ravenous again! And, if I was in Vancouver in
          the next few weeks, I’d check out some of these 3-4.5
          course meals for $15($25) and I’d take along a date! Some of these
          dining places has great scenic view of the city too…</p>

		<p>				All Scripture is God-breathed and
        is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness,
        so that the man of God may be thoroughly equipped for every good work.”
        

</p><p> Plato believed that <i>all</i> good writers/poets are divinely inspired
          (secular terms of today: “giftedness, talent, genius”). Most critics
          nowadays beg to differ, I think. The notion of God inspiring the writer/author,
          who in turn inspires the audience just sounds absurd, almost. And yet,
          Christians believe that the word of God is inspired by Himself, which
          really means that Plato’s perspectives in expressive theory (the relationship
          between the work and the author) is still very much alive/real today.
          Hrm. Funny thing is that we discussed this in class this week and then
          it was reinforced in my devos last night…Oh, don’t ask me what’s his
          definition of “good” is because I have yet to form a solid answer on
          that one…
        </p>



<p> Because I’m still waiting for a wall calendar, I decided to modify
          Boy’s
          version to plan <a href="javascript:%20OpenWindow('calendar.html')">my
          term</a> as it progresses…
        </p>



<p> with 3 courses in CS, and only 1 English course, I feel like I’m a
          CS major instead of a English major this term. As a CSer now, I lose
          my full reading week as well :(, but I think I’m going to create my
          own if all goes well (i.e. workload-wise) :). I’m practically falling
          asleep in my DB class and although GK recommends that I don’t purchase
          the required textbook, I decided that if I could earn double dividend
          pts, a $5 gift cert to chapters, free shipping and save myself $50,
          I could purchase this textbook, use it, and then resell it without too
          much of a loss. Thankfully, GK has the lecture notes from last term
          b/c this prof is making us print it. The DB course makes my Computer
          Systems course really interesting (since in the last class, we learnt
          about <i>grammar</i>! :P), and my Business System Analysis class “okay”
          (although I’m tempted to zzz in that class too) in comparison. The History
          of Lit Theory actually seems like an elective now especially since there
          are no assignments in that course, only 3-4 essay tests :).

<p> Free Jelly
          Belly samples? Yep. I hope they come! 🙂 Took me three days before
          I got the form tho.. :P.</p>

		<p>				 Where is Madagascar?
          Hint: it’s on the Risk (and Axis and Allies i think) board.
        </p>



<p> As I was taking a shower today, my thought process eventually wandered
          to Madagascar. I remember in my early high school years, during the
          days of Risk, the island would constantly stick out on the board, which
          eventually ended up as the choice for a hypothetical STM trip for at
          least two(?) of us. And, although God may yet to call Girl (and perhaps
          another) there, I’m also reminded of Campus Crusade’s OEX
          project. I’ve been semi-interested for the wrong reasons since I’ve
          heard about it in first year. I’ve always found a reason not to go (like
          this year, convocation/family plans is happening during the project).
          Anyhow, back to the Malagasy. Hrm. I guess I’ve never really been curious
          about Madagascar, aside from the geographical location in the world,
          until today. And, I believe that it’s time for me to pray for the country,
          now that I know a l’il more about the people there…</p>

		<p>				 Scene I<br>
          GK: Are you busy?<br>
          Me: No, why?<br>
          GK: You wanna go see <i>Two Weeks Notice</i>?<br>
          Me: Um, okay! [I start laffin’]… Tho’ I just came back from watching
          <i>Maid in Manhattan</i>!
        </p>



<p> Scene II<br>
          GK: [holds KFC cup on her way out]<br>
          Me: Oh! You went to KFC too?!<br>
          GK: Yeah, that’s why I called you about dinner.<br>
          Me: Where are we seeing <i>Two Weeks Notice</i>?<br>
          GK: Galaxy.<br>
          Me: [ha ha] I just came from there…<br></p>



<p> Two movies, four hours, sixteen bucks (wow, it’s exponentially(?)
          correlated). Not bad on a school night. So, after seeing the first chick
          flick w some guys/girl and the second with some girls, I think I like
          <i>Two Weeks Notice</i> a tad more. Although the movie title from <i>Maid
          in Manhattan</i> is quite clever (alliteration and pun(?) on Made in
          Manhanttan) and <i>Two Weeks Notice</i> is grammatically incorrect and
          is highly bothersome (think should be “Two Weeks’ Notice” since it’s
          the notice of two weeks [possesive]), and Sandra Bullock playing as
          Lucy is repetitive (see <i>While You Were Sleeping</i>), there was more
          humour in her movie and contains “somewhat” more of a plot. Now, I also
          wanna see <i>How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days</i>, which is due out in February
          sometime…maybe I’ll drag someone to see it during my so-called reading
          week :).</p>

		<p>				I thank you that you brought me to CC today (01.07.2003:
          I can’t remember what CC stands for). I was amazed at what one girl,
          Vanessa did. Even though she really wasn’t paying attention, she was
          writin’ a letter/prayer to you! Sorry, if I d/n stop her, but I was
          awestruck at what a grade 2/3 girl did! She had this book full of “think-you”s
          (meaning thank-you) to God! To see her write in it first touched my
          heart and made me realise that anyone could write them, not only the
          ones who knew how to write. She took so much time to write each letter,
          erasing it if it wasn’t “perfect”, kinda made me feel guilty that I
          didn’t do it as often and wishinig that i started this as a kid…
        …
        

</p><p> 1 John 3:16 says, “<i>This is how we know what love is: Jesus Christ
          laid down his life for us. And we ought to lay down our lives for our
          brothers.</i>”
        </p>



<p> How am I, as a Christian, to follow that verse? One of my friends
          was in trouble last term and I realised that I couldn’t give up my life
          for him/her even though I wanted to help. I couldn’t imagine putting
          everything in my life on hold or giving it up for another friend so
          that s/he could deserve better and to have a solid relationship with
          Jesus. I couldn’t bear to sacrifice school, my relationships, and/or
          my future for this person (as it would entail at least one of those
          sacrifices). So, how am I to lay down my life for my brothers/sisters?</p>

		<p>				 This section is Part II of my first rant…after being delayed for
          another 1.5+ hours (from 23h05 to 12h45 quoted departure time, but by
          then we didn’t even board yet), the flight was relatively smooth as
          I was exhausted from boarding that morning/afternoon (details to come
          in next section) so I just slept. The sunrise during the 4+ hr flight
          over the praries (sp?) was beautiful–the three hues of blue, orange,
          and pink…Shame that my digcam wasn’t available. ARGH. The most frustrating
          part of this flight wasn’t the delayed arrivals or departures, which
          they blamed on the snowstorm in TO (I don’t really believe them as Air
          Canada didn’t seem to have any problems throughout the day), but rather
          the chaotic MESS they made of the retrieval of our baggages/luggages.
          We arrived around 8h45(?) but didn’t actually get out of the airport
          til way past 10h00! Allegedly, the plane was too heavy and couldn’t
          travel properly in the snowstorm, so they had to leave behind some baggage
          from random passengers. Unfortunately for us, one of us was the victim
          and 2 of her 3 things were left bhind. After waiting in line to be served
          by 1 person and filling out some forms, we learnt that the baggages
          wouldn’t arrive til later in the afternoon by courier, which meant that
          our travel plans to Niagra Falls would’ve been canned. Luckily, Eunie’s
          parents were willing to stay home to wait for the package.
        </p>



<p> And of course, knowing Jetsgo, during that afternoon the bag/snowboard
          didn’t make it. Eunie, Becks, Mel, and I trekked around Niagra Falls/Clifton
          Hills area (from top of Ripley’s Believe it or not Museum to parking
          took us 1 hr walk) and took some pix (w my APS), which hopefully turns
          out okay :). The exercise was really nice because Mel and I needed to
          work off our stiff bodies (from head to toe and Boy, I can just see
          you laffin!). The shower at night really helped b/c I managed to stretch
          some of it off =P. Jetsgo apparently called Eunie’s house the next morn
          and her parents had to be late for church b/c Beck’s stuff came at 10am.
          Thankfully, this time the stuff arrived in one piece. Tho’ if I was
          Becky, I would write the company a complaint letter because of the inconvenience
          caused, as well as the trouble of having to get a new toothbrush/socks/etc.
        </p>



<p> And now, the reason for my pain: snowboarding! Yes, what fun!<br>
          Mel and I went snowboarding (w/o prior experience in skiing either)
          for the very first time on Friday, just hours before our flight back
          to Ontario. Yes, we are quite “sad”– haven’t done stuff that tourists
          pay tons for to do out West. My dad suggested that I go on New Year’s
          but because my bro refused to teach Mel and I, I wasn’t quite psyched
          up or had any gear ready to go when Boy offered on New Year’s eve to
          take/teach us the day after. However, after a miscalculation of $97
          to $84, I decided that even tho’ I could likely rent and get a discount
          lift pass elsewhere another time, Mel and I decided to go on the 5th
          to <a href="http://www.cypressmountain.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cypress</a>.
          Mou (or Becks, but somehow, I’m useta seeing her name as Mou now :P)
          kindly lent me her gear (gloves, pants, touque) and my sis lent me her
          pants and my bro, his old snowboarding jacket. For some strange reason
          tho, my butt got all wet even w 2 track/water resistant pants on, and
          Mel’s stayed perfectly dry…ah wellz :).
        </p>



<p> Contrary to a friend’s slightly-biased opinion, Boy is actually quite
          a good instructor and after many, many falls, we got the basics by the
          end of the day (went from about 9 am til 3 pm w a lunch break in-btwn)
          :). However, it took us soo long to get down the runs and thus, we only
          had time to go down two: EasyRider (the bunny hill three times?) and
          Collins (green once: took us over an hour to accomplish…I especially
          hated the ICE at the top of that run…poor Boy, he had to sit and wait
          for us to get up from our many wipe outs). By the end of the day tho’,
          I was about to have some control by talking to my snowboard and pointing
          in the direction I wanted to go, and most of all, I ended the run off
          upright and at a full stop 🙂 (I still can’t ride off the lifts properly
          tho). Hahah, I ended up leaving my license and my credit card in my
          bro’s jacket so when I was at the the casino in Niagra (no gambling),
          I had to show my passport for ID purposes :P. Snowboarding again? Yes!
        </p>



<p> And that ends my Christmas holiday. Another term begins, and hopefully
          by the end of this one, I’ll be done!</p>

Well, i did do something on Boxing Day. I woke up at 6 AM to go to <a href="http://www.absound.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A&B Sound</a> (whalley branch) in hopes to get a deal on a MP3 player (32MB expandable w SM card–Rio One) for $49. Shame that it was the first item to sell out and after being in the line up for 1.5 hours before getting into the store, there wasn’t much left. My dad picked up the last stack of laser paper for 2 bucks, and I just found a small toy (<a href="http://www.i-zone.com/products/product_detail.jsp?PRODUCT%3C%3Eprd_id=30587&FOLDER%3C%3Efolder_id=398115&bmLocale=id&bmUID=1041286950079&PRDREG=ID&FromListing=1&SOURCE=catalog" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Polariod camera</a>–I figured that even if it costs an arm an leg to replace the film, since it already included film (sticky pics) and batteries, it was worth the $14 even as a “disposable cam”).  Well, we later ventured into Richmond and I stopped by a FS to purchase the $69(?) 48x28x48 LG CDRW writer on behalf of my sister, 2 boxes of 10s CD-Rs w thin jewel cases for $0.99 (after rebate and taxes excluded), and a headset “to play CS” on behalf of my bro for $0 (after mail-in rebate excluding taxes on $20).
</p>



<p>
Fast forward to last night (spent one night watching cheese fOb vcd with chris and ma “Boy” w dinner compliments of the chef, chris, and the other night with Lorraine and 2 GQers fer dinner and pool). After dinner, my HS friends waited over an hour and a half to bowl at this 36-lane bowling “alley” in Surrey (Xcalibur) for a free lane so that we could play at $0.25 a game (excluding $5.00 shoe rental..which is normally at $3.75), i had to leave b/c it was getting close to midnight. The weather outside was awful. I can’t believe how bad the snow-response team is…oh wait, didn’t the Lower Mainland sell its snow plow many years ago to another province because it doesn’t “snow” here :}? The roads were slushy, covered with snow and no sign of snow plows or salting machines. It’s no wonder ppl can’t drive in BC in the snow. Everyone was going 30 to 40 kms on a 60 km/hr street…some car would’ve plowed into me if I was driving beside it because he turned into the lane on my left from someplace and skidded. On the other hand, my car totally did the same on one turn and the pick-up in the opposing lane saw it coming, so he slowed down which was a wise and generous thing to do!</p>

SO, as I was saying…I hate <a href="http://www.jetsgo.net" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jetsgo</a>. I’m never going with them again. Why? Well, although I do give them props for price and value of the plane ticket, their service really sucks. Reasons? Read on:


</p><ol><li>
Before we left for the airport, Marc and Keith calls me and tries to scare me with the news story that a Jetsgo flight had to make an emergency stopover in Calgary (which is not a destined stop on all Jetsgo flights) due to unforseen engine problems.</li>




<li>What’s up with the lack of express check-in electronic kiosks at the airport check-in? Bah, oh well, at least the line up was relatively short. The lady at the check-in told us that the flight was delayed an hour, which is quite normal…so, we killed time by returning carts and with the $3, eunie bought us food to share :). However, I had thought that departure times on the boarding pass meant that was when the plane leaves the gate, but apparently not with Jetsgo. We finally boarded the plane though. Unfortunately for passengers destined to Halifax, the departure time was also futher pushed from the early afternoon to 20:00 and then from then to 00:20. Another 4 hours! Poor them. I would be terribly irate too especially with no offer of compensation for missing connecting flights, etc. I overheard at the counter that apparently, the plane experienced problems because it left the gate and then had to return back to the gate for unspecified reasons.</li>




<li>
Security. Or, lack thereof. If I had accidentally dropped my boarding pass, anyone could’ve picked it up and posed as me for they did not ask for photo ID, unlike Tango/AC. Speaking of security, how did my shoes set off the security alarm!? They are not steel-toed. At first, I thought the cha-siu baos and such set it off so I had to send it through the heavy with radiation x-ray machines.</li>




<li>
Déjà vu? Our plane left the gate and increased the engine speed to ascend with flight attendants strapped in for take-off, when all of a sudden, the plane slowed down. The flight attendants at the front frantically gestured and PAed the rest of the crew to the front and quickly shut the curtain to discuss the matter. Hrm, how suspicious and reassuring is that?! Apparently, the cargo door switch light was malfunctioning so the plane had to return to the gate to get maintenance to fix it while the passengers remained seated and waited for a very long time (apparently, they said 10-15 mins but it was way more than that).</li>




<li>
Ethos. <i>ethos</i> is greek representing “ethical appeal”–the credibility of a company. Mel and I are still unsure what the company is trying to market. The flight attendants are dressed in black leather jackets. Mixed with such young faces (fresh outta college? Theory is that Christmas season is when people with seniority take time off so they need to hire interns or the company is so new that they can’t afford to hire people with experience), they convey a lack of professionalism. May we have one free smile please? One especially looked like a street punk with his jacket and jewellery and open collared shirt. Maybe that’s one the lady behind Melody decided to pick on them and whine and complain to the flight attendants, to which the Captain/pilot heard the incident and came out to address the woman:

<p>
Cap: My crew informs me that some words were exchanged from you. I will not tolerate any abuse to any of my crew members. If I hear from you again, I will ask you leave as it is a federal offense…<br>
Lady: But I didn’t say anything! (I didn’t hear what she said so I’m not sure if she’s telling the truth but she did whine and complain to her son for most of the waiting time to which the son must’ve been quite embarassed at her behaviour and acted so much more maturely than she did). <br>
Cap: I got to take my crew’s word against yours. Do I have your word that you will not bother them for the remainder of the flight?<br>
Lady: But..<br>
Son: Mom, just say, “Yes.”<br>
Lady: [Reluctantly because she thinks she has done no wrong] Yes.<br>
Cap: Thank you. [walks back to his post]
</p>



<p>
She and Melody then writes the company a letter on our respective laptops to which one flight attendant nosely (dat a word?) pauses to read what Mel and her are typing and returns to us with a brochure and says, “You can find the address at the back of this.” Gee thanks, miss. I guess they tried to recompensate by offering people two free drinks, but I wasn’t even sure that it was free because all they asked was, “Can I get you anything to drink?” until I verified that it was indeed complimentary. I guess they also tried because as we exited, the same flight attendant, said “thank you, goodbye” to everyone else but when Mel got to the door, she added, “Sorry for the inconvenience.”


</p></li><li>
Quality. Okay, so maybe there is less leg room, the bathroom is more claustrophobic, and there is no inflight entertainment (unlike its competitor, Tango, which you can “purchase” as an option) because the plane is old (glow in the dark exit signs!?), but at least they can provide cleanliness to their passengers. Melody’s seat jacket had a empty water bottle left behind by a passenger from a previous flight. How disgusting. I didn’t even bother checking mine for garbage. Didn’t want to know. And, you know how airplanes generally have headrest covers to “protect” you from everyone else’s germs? Well, all we saw was velcro (and no cover). So basically, even if the company does not wash the covers, at least make it <i>look</i> like you try! Not to mention that “wash bassin” is spelt with one “s” and not two (basin)…and we were dying of overstuffiness of recycled air. Usually planes have AC on or something, but this one was opposite. Mel also disliked the air freshner that occasionally leaked from the bathroom heheh.. 😛</li>






</ol>


Thank God that we got home safely! Pray for our return trip please; unfortunately, it’s wiht Jetsgo.
