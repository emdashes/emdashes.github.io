I wonder what the symptoms of pneumonia are?</p>




<p>Whee! Free VIP tickets to see the BC Autoshow next Thursday evening – one for me and for 2 of my friends. The perks to having a family member purchase a new car within the past year =).
</p>




<p>
<i>“I have a car, I have high-paying career, I have a girlfriend, but I am not happy; I wish I have inner peace.”</i> My heart breaks to hear of the echoing cries of those who have everything, and yet have nothing. How do you <i>tell</i> someone that the empty hole can only be filled by Him? How do you share Jesus, the answer to the meaning of life, with them? The question, is how?

Spent time catching up with a good friend of mine today (even though we hardly talk anymore). I think the history of us just let me trust him in sharing what’s going in my life. Sort of nice to be able to do that and find that we were both going through similar struggles with career choices, and coming to the same conclusions. Weekend was crazy eventful: saw a UBC Gala Ball (ie. latin and standard ballroom competition) from 9-5 on Sat, attended Theatresports (like drew carey’s who’s line is it anyway – I believe Colin came from this league) – but wasn’t as great as expected. Sun evening was <a href="http://www.stomponline.com">STOMP!</a> Considering we bought the tickets at 1/2 price (half-price tickets booth like the one in NYC) on Saturday, we only paid $37.50 for 2nd row seats (well it’s row 6 in the RHS but that section starts at row 5). For 1 and 1/2 hrs, it was pure dance, rhythm, and sweat. I was pretty impressed, and it was quite entertaining, but definitely not a standard broadway musical. You can see some of their acts on their website. Not sure if it was worth $60+ to see it at a regular price though. I’ve wanted to see them since Vonne and I saw a preview of them on the streets as we were lining up to get $40USD tickets for Miss Saigon in NYC.</p>




<p>
For those doctors out there, please diagnose my illness correctly; I seriously don’t believe that it’s “just a flu”.
Just so happens that my family doctor is away this week, and the substitute doctor won’t take any appointments unless they’re “urgent”. The receptionist recommended that I go to a walk-in clinic today. However, the young chinese male doctor looked me over for 1 minute and declared that I had the flu (just looked into my mouth with a light (no stick), and told me to breathe so that he could listen through the stethoscope). When I asked if he had any recommendations to help my symptoms, he just said that over-the-counter medication only relieve symptoms temporarily for a few hours, so he basically told me to tough it out. I sound like a frog now when I speak, or like I’m dying because I can’t talk above a whisper or else risk going into a coughing spell. The good in this? My abs are definitely getting a good work-out! It just automatically contracts every so often now, even when I’m not coughing (I think it’s the way I breathe). I don’t care if I don’t get paid; I’m not going to work tomorrow.</p>




<p>The symptoms? Try not to be grossed out okay? If you are the type that does, please don’t read on:<br>
-Fri: Cold chills accompanied with fever I think (didn’t have a thermometer with me at work); slight cough deep from within lungs<br>
-Sat: Dry cough with coloured phlegm (yuck!), which occasionally had blood traces<br>
-Sun: Same cough increases<br>
-Mon: Same cough, sore and swollen throat develops, along with mild earache when swallowing<br>
Now, the doctor predicts that I will get a runny nose in the next few days. I hope to prove him wrong just so I know that it’s not a flu. If it is, this is quite the flu. I haven’t had it this bad in a few years, especially with the coughing. Last time I almost lost my voice was when I was on CCF committee back in 3rd year (and Pork was my voice up in front hehe). OK, so I lied. I looked back at my archives, and it seems like I get sick at least once a year around this time, maybe not as bad, but still bad enough.

Too much. In the past week, I’ve read way too many blogs where the writer is suffering from being sick. Guess what? Now, it’s my turn. I’m battling a cough (which is the kind that is deep from within the lungs), with body stiffness/soreness/spasms (well, probably from badminton too yesterday, but the entire body feels weak),accompanied with a minor headache and cold spells (even though my body is warm to touch) at times. Look what all you sick people in Ontario did! Your germs somehow managed to travel this far and over cyberspace! 😐 Thankfully, we have a whole Kirkland bottle of acetaminophen in our kitchen cupboard at the office…=þ</p>




<p>
During my slumber on Monday, I had a very interesting <a href="http://www.xanga.com/see_lai" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dream</a> that prepared me to handle the news from a certain company quite well. On Wednesday, I heard back from the company I interviewed with two weeks ago, and well, once again my dream came true {only 4-6 of my dreams have come true within the past 5 years – if more did, I would be pretty freaked, as some of my dreams are quite violent in nature}. Back to the real world; the company left me a voicemail saying that they had made an offer to another candidate that had a little more core technical writing experience than I did, but the interviewer, whom I’ve interviewed with 3 times now, was apparently pretty impressed with me. In fact, the recruitment co-ordinator mentioned that if I was ever in town, I should let them know in advance, so that she can arrange an meeting with her. Now that would serve to be quite an interesting experience and it’s something that I do look forward to – hopefully by the end of this summer.</p>

As a follow-up to my last post, a verse comes into mind, when I reminded of my story – in 1 Corinthians 3:6 Paul says, “I planted the seed, Apollos watered it, but God made it grow.” I may not be the planter, but the waterer, but God is responsible to make a flower sprout and grow as long as we do our parts respectively.</p>




<p>
Highlights of the weekend:


</p><ol><li>Fresh fruit shakes at BubbleZone averages $3.25 (I think). However, there was one that stood out which I still don’t get as to why it’s so expensive: $4.25! Anyhow, being one who doesn’t mind trying new foods, my friend decided that as long as I finished the drink, he would pay for it. He wanted to see me suffer. Let me tell you now, that doing that is hardly worth it, but for $4.25 that I would never have otherwised paid, I agreed. Wow, what a pugent drink. I think I shall stay away from durian for a long time, but at least I saved myself the cost of a drink and it did quench my thirst. Sorry, Marc, I’ve decided that I don’t want to try the real fruit pieces.
</li>




<li>Picked up a Palm portable keyboard for my Palm IIIxe that I ordered from NCIX.com a month ago for $1.13 after work on Saturday. I guess it’s times like this that old technology serves you good. Now, I can take notes in Sunday school without having to write them down and type them out again!</li>




<li>Played some Daytona, fooseball, and a couple of games of pool at EA. Haven’t “dook ball” in awhile, was nice playing again.</li>




<li>Watched Mel drink 5 shots, one being one where she had to pick out the shooter without the aid of her hands basically by shoving her face in a whole martini glass of whipped cream. Yuck. Had DQ ice cream cake which didn’t quite sit well in my stomach overnight.</li>




<li>Enjoyed a homecooked meal that was made from fresh king crab ($9.99/lb which came to about $50+!). Mmmm =9!</li>


</ol>

<i>The Sacred Romance</i>, <i>The Journey of Desire</i> – titles that sound like topics on relationships. And, they are. They are two books that I’ve read on the relationship between you and God. I really enjoyed reading those books, and was deeply saddened to hear that one of co-authors died shortly before finishing (or starting?) the second book. I’d lend you these books except, I lent it out to Ben one year, and never got them back. So you can ask him for it if his friends have returned it back to him yet. In any event, when I saw another book by John Elredge, I never gave it another thought and borrowed it from the church library; it was titled, <i>Wild at Heart</i>. Of the two books that I’ve read that were geared to men, I recommend them both. This one and <i>Every Man’s Battle</i>. While the latter dwells with a man’s struggle with p0rnography and how to overcome it, this one dwells more into the psyche of a man’s character (what makes a man, a man) or as the cover says, “Discovering the Secret of a Man’s Soul”. Well, it’s nice to know that there are still some knights out there who want to valiantly rescue a beautiful maiden (in distress) – the sense of danger and adventure in a man Elredge argues, is innate; that God made him that way.</p>




<p>
I’m finally at peace with where I am. For those that don’t know, a certain company in ‘loo called me to interview me for a job I didn’t apply for – and surprisingly (since I had been ‘rejected’ twice before with the same company), I managed to pass the first set of interviews and moved onto the 2nd (and final) interview. If it was just a few months ago, I would’ve gladly dropped what I was doing, and moved back. ‘Cept it just hit me a week or so ago. I’m finally beginning to see the opportunities all around me here, with the people that God has placed in my life and in the areas that I may be able to serve. I’m praying that God will place me where I can be the most effective in my ministry to others – if ‘loo, so be it. If I should be staying now and foregoing a technical writer position, then I’ll rejoice as well. Funny, how it’s a win-win situation in a sense.</p>




<p>
A week ago, I found out that someone who used to act as a mentor to me when I was a teenager had used his time wisely on the bus. Every day, as he bused to work, he would see the same faces and would be interested in finding out about their lives – one in particular. Over the months (and years), they established a relationship, a friendship that would last until this day. Today, they even meet for lunch sometimes, and yet, I’ve only known this friend for less than 3 months – and our friendship didn’t really take off until two weekends ago. I’m amazed how God works. He’s already planted seeds in my friends life through another Christian. In hindsight, it’s pretty funny to know that ever since I found out that another guy had offered to take my friend to see the Passion of Christ for free, I have been praying for that ‘anonymous’ Christian and thanking God for him – who turns out to be someone I knew all along!</p>




<p>Thought of the week: My heart gets easily confused between (other) love and romantic love.</p>

		<p>				With all this talk surrounding <i>the Passion of the Christ</i> (or, otherwise known to me simply as “the Passion” prior to the name change), it’s hard to avoid it. No, I’m not one of those who have flocked to the theatres to see it just yet, although I do have “free” Famous Player and Cineplex Odeon tickets to use. I have my reservations, one being a very silly one – because I now associate Harry Potter to be the actor and Frodo to be Elijah Wood, will I do the same for Jesus? The main reason that I’m shying away is that if I walked out of the theatre of Gladiator to only never to return because of its gory violence (no, I have not yet seen Kill Bill for that matter), I don’t know if I will be able to sit for 2.x hours to watch this movie. And, yet, as a Christian, I somehow feel pressured to, or obligated to – but I can’t seem to verbalize a “why”. Anyhow, just don’t be surprised if you ask me if I’ve seen it and I tell you no.</p>

Saturday was another fun day of snowboarding. Melody and I went alone this time, only to get pelted on by huge balls of hail and ice with almost zero visibility. Consequences of not being able to see? Taking wrong turns and ending up on runs that you’re not exactly ready for skill-wise or are expecting. Yaay, so we’ve “upgraded” from green runs to doing short blue runs purely from accident – the advantage of taking Hutch? Avoiding going the flat section on Colins and by-passing traffic since no one seems to take Hutch. Whee! I discovered that the level of “blue” is similar to the level of “greens” at Blackcomb – no wonder I  had no control on Blackcomb! Well, at least, there were no major wipeouts on Hutch, but tons of slowing down =p. When the sky did clear up in the afternon, with tons of sunshine and excellent visibility, Hutch looked scarier than before, but nevertheless, we took it!

		<p>				At 5:30 AM on Tuesday morning, the first Krispy Kreme in British Columbia opened its doors to eager customers. Campers stayed overnight to grab the first batch fresh off the belt. Line-ups stretched two blocks, traffic jams were unavoidable, and people patiently waited for up to 2 hours to taste the ‘krispy, kremey’ doughnuts that are filled with 199-340 calories each. Yum? O.o Well, I have yet to try mine unglazed because the original glazed is way to sweet for me – it drips of sugar. It’s a 10 min drive from my workplace, so I imagine that I will visit sometime. Even if I have a craving at 3 am, the drive-thru is open 24 hrs. And, the first day of sales? $90,000. Any franchise takers? Ha.</p>

What’s a trackback? Well, haloscan uses wikipedia to define it as: <i>Trackback is a system […] that alerts and allows a blogger to see who has blogged about posts on his or her blog. The system works by sending a ‘ping’ between the blogs, and therefore providing the alert.</i> Simply put, it’s way to link related sites and to see who’s linked your post. Trackback is new to me, so I have much to learn, just like those who have been asking me. The old “X new pennies” link meant that there were that many comments that you have not read.</p>




<p>
For those ICQ and MSIE (internet explorer) fans – note that they are not mutually exclusive – please fix your icq before you keep annoying trillian or mozilla users like me who aren’t affected by the jokeworld.biz worm. Yes, if you have opened a link that said something to the effects of jokeworld.biz/index.html LOL, and you were using IE, you should check your ICQ folder under “Sounds” to see if there is a new directory called Meine. If yes, it means you likely have a worm. To find out more about this intriguing worm, the only document I found on google about it at . And no, I don’t know how to remove it – just scan your computer with a virus scanner. I know my workplace virus detector found it on my computer at work, so it should be okay. Oh yeh, it’s effects? Annoying other ICQ users with that url, potentially infecting others, and your icq may cease to work (as some of my friend have quickly found out).
