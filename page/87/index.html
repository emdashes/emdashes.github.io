While we’re on the topic of the Bible, my English professor proposed a few theories in the last few classes: one being that everything in the Bible focuses toward Jesus Christ; the OT points to the birth of Christ, whereas the NT leads to His first and second comings. Basing on my current knowledge of the Bible, I don’t see how “everything” does, but I guess thematically, I would have to agree. On a related note, the Catholic Church was <i>the</i> authority on censorship (I’m no history major, so you can ask Cal or Ben A. to tell you when because I don’t remember) at one point in history, and thus censored many literary works. However, those that defended the texts argued that through exigesis (a close examination and interpretation of the text), one can “read” a text in a way that fits into Christian principles…I guess much like how some may analyze the Matrix and the Lord of the Rings in that sense…which is why many “secular” texts (eg. by Homer — not to be confused by Homer Simpson) survived. Ah yes, censorship is another issue which I shalt not dwell on today.
</p>



<p>
Continuing on literature: A friend of mine asked me a couple of weeks ago why Shakespeare and his works was and is still so widely read/known today. Readers, any thoughts? Applying what I’ve learnt in my English class recently, my prof would likely interject and respond by saying that firstly, Shakespeare wrote plays that are often classified as being tragic or comical (tragedy, comedy). Aristotle may argue that Shakespeare deviated from the genre of Tragedy/Comedy, which makes the plays highly interesting. In <i>The Poetics</i>, Aristotle distinguishes the characteristics of a Tragedy versus a Comedy. Logically speaking, an event is tragic when pity is evoked from seeing a good man encountering misfortune. On the other hand, a situation is seen as being comical when a lesser man, of a “lower type” (ludicrous defect/ugliness) is dramatised or overly-jested), the audience offers no pity. Yet, one cannot extend these characteristics of such genres to Shakespeare’s plays for if we take his tragedies under Aristotle’s definitions, one realises that they are not really tragedies at all! Take MacBeth and Hamlet for example, the audience feels helpless and pity for them because of a flaw that causes their tragedic fall, but both of them are murderers, how are they “good”?
</p>



<p>
To end yet another long post off, why was Jesus so influential? He was not a scholar or a rhetorican, but rather, a carpenter’s son. This is one question that if given the opportunity, my teens would ask God or would like to find the answer for (yes, I’m ending in yet another preposition). If you have any insights to this, or any of the questions  <a href="javascript:OpenWindow('questions.html')">here</a>, please drop me a line! Thank you.</p>

		<p>				<code>  Rewind: During the mid-90s, when the Canadian HQs of Campus Crusade for Christ was located in Surrey, BC, I got to know the faces of those that visited "our" restaurant. From then on, I was intrigued by this Christian organisation that wanted to "change the world". I guess this organisation has been dear to me ever since I found out that they impacted me without them realising, for I dedicated my life to Christ in 1992 through one of it's then existent outreach ministries: Maralee Dawn, the ventroliquist.
  Fast-forward some years: One summer's day in August of 1998, I wandered the halls of Campus Crusade of Christ Canada's HQs under the "fertilised" air of Langley, BC. The two weeks of working with HR (even tho I was assigned quite menial tasks) really gave me a first glimpse (the second would be with <a href="http://www.fotf.ca" target=_blank>Focus on the Family, Canada</a> a year later) of the joys of working in a Christian organisation, doing work for God full-time and the importance and the impact of Campus Crusade for Christ has on the world.
  As I looked at the various campuses across Canada and the coloured pins (and years of existence?) that were stuck on each one that had a Campus Crusade for Christ fellowship on the campus. I recall seeing a pin on UW and mentally noted to check it out in the upcoming school year.
  Imagine my surprise when during my first year, only about 10 or so students showed. In those days, there was no weekly fellowship, but rather a separate bible study group for both guys and girls that met on different days of the week. Perhaps once a month, we'd get together and spend time with the rest of the group. I can't say that I attended everything, but I do recall that we'd fit into 1 or 2 cars and be able to do some games, worship at someone's house and on special nights, we'd carpool to Guelph to have OEX prjct sharings, dinners, or to have workshops on spiritual gifts, joining with surrounding CCCs. Today? They have over 40 students meeting every week for a time of worship and fellowship! Neat, eh? What's more, is that the leader of my Bible study group (and leader for many of the other events) is now married to fiancé/bf and serving full-time at CCC! I saw their picture today with the Africa Sonrise Project 2002 team...(yes, one theory I have is that dedicated CCC leaders eventually get married soon after graduation, to someone within CCC, and then both of them serve full-time with them..I know at least 5 couples that followed this "trend" and the thing is I don't know very many CCCers). Praise God for what He has done over the years! :)
  Aside: As much as I support CCC, I still have my reservations about some of their staff's outlook, for they represent CCC--I fully support their desire to change and impact the world, but to diminish the importance of outreaching to a smaller community (ie. outreach to chinese culture and its community as inferior to reaching the world) somehow turned me off or away from wanting to serve with them on campus, which is why I'm still at Chinese Christian Fellowship (part of <a href="http://www.afc-ca.org" target=_blank>Ambassadors For Christ</a>), which I realise is a smaller organisation, but they serve to outreach to a specific group, which I don't believe for a minute that they are neglecting the Great Commission to "make disciples of <i>all</i> nations..." (Matthew 29:19) for they raise people and send them to different nations in the world to carry the Good News as well. So within 5 years, a multiplication of 4 times the people at UWCCC. With the double cohort next year and by God's grace over the next few years, I would not be surprised to see UWCCC the size of UWCCF today!

      A psychological and spiritual look into the dreams of one’s self–PT lent me this book as a result of our previous discussion on dreaming and sin. Meier and Wise seem to discredit more of Freud’s theories and instead, support arguments from Carl Jung in regards to dreams and symbols. Like PT, I’m not entire sure I agree with the ideas of the books or the encouragement for one to do dream-works. The book encourages one to remember his/her dreams and to analyze them into full detail. I don’t seem to have problems doing that, but sometimes I would like to not remember my dreams and be at peace. For one, the authors seem to indicate dreaming of a having a sensual relationship with another of the opposite sex is not abnormal, or is it anything to worry bout (ie. being wrong) for they write, “The next time your mate talks aloud to another person in his or her dreams, don’t get suspious or worried. To the contrary, the spouse is probably defusing the problem of stray attractions!” (191). Hrm, I’m not sure how that works, but okay if that’s how they get comforted…I wonder if that also works for non-married couples…On the other hand, the authors note that predictive dreams (dreams that in hindsight seem to indicate reality) does “not cause us to anticipate future as much as to recognise the work of God when it comes to pass”. I believe that statement makes sense for when I dreamt about “finding” my friend Tommy, I didn’t realise that it would come true and when it did, I did remember my dreams…and my actions/prayers to God regarding them. Maybe I’ll check out a similar book in the future entitled, <i><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/stores/detail/-/books/0830725695/reviews/002-6576798-0392866#08307256953200" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dreams and Visions</a></i> by Jane Hamon to see what she hasta say about dreams in another spiritual/biblical perspective.
      

</p><p>
	  Speaking of dreams, at 7:58 am this morning, I was abruptly shaken from my dreams by a *CRASH! SLAM! BUMP!*, followed by an “AH! I can’t see! Why is everything so dark?!” and then a millisecond of silence and then a painful groan. </p>



<p>With that, I instinctly knew that there was something wrong. I recalled that temporary blindness happens if and when there is pressure on the brain against the optical nerve (or something like that) which then causes one to not be able to see. I jumped outta bed, yanked my door open, and peered into the hall with my mind still in a haze and muttered, “Is everything alright?!” and was met with my housemate’s bf coming into the door heading towards her room. At the instance that I saw him, I knew that he’d be able to take care of anything so I was reassured and headed back to bed, tho’ with much worry. Within seconds, I heard, “aarg, I feel like puking!”. Thus, I hustled a prayer towards the heavens praying for her safety, comfort, and healing and relunctantly went back to a restless sleep.
	  </p>



<p>
	  I suspected that she was taken to the hospital especially when the Yellow Pages was left open on the dinner table to the Taxi/Cabs page. Thankfully, she’s okay now, resting in her bed. She told me today that she bumped her head against a hard surface two days ago but did not feel any effects until yesterday, when she was slightly naseous, which also resided. However, this morning, when she was brushing her teeth and putting her contacts on, her vision suddenly blacked-out and she must’ve said everything I’ve heard (but she couldn’t remember) before passing out on the floor in the bathroom. When I opened my door, in my state of confusion, I did not notice her on the bathroom floor for all I saw was her boyfriend rushing into the house. Because I did not know about her previous fall or that she was suffering from post-concussion syndrome (as the doctor identified her to have today), I would’ve likely called 911 as a response to her phrase of not being able to see (fainting I can deal with for I’ve done that myself twice in a day at BAC) but thankfully, her bf came just in time (God’s timing!). The taxi was not to the hospital but rather to the Health Clinic, where after examination, they sent her to ER on a stretcher in an ambulance! There, they proceeded to do a CAT scan, draw 5 vials(?)/bags of blood, and placed her on IV for a few hours. Nothing seemed to be out of order, so they sent her home (where she proceeds to attend class b/c of attendance marks!) and so here she rests. Thank God that she’s okay, for my mind was quite unsettled during my classes today.
</p>

Aside: The wallpaper on my desktop needs to be changed. Although it’s a lovely scenery shot of BC (by Boy?), and I see can “touch” the mountains and the waters, everytime I gaze at the waters for too long, my bladder decides to shrink some..hahaha…purely psychological I tell ya!</p>

		<p>				did get to know a few ppl that I didn’t know (at all, or too well) before, which was what I wanted as a bare minimum.  By the end of the weekend, I also came to realise that I wouldn’t see some of them again because they are on work-term now and I’d likely be gone by the time they are back. Each night, I had some really good late-night conversations on an one-on-one basis with both Anna and Becky–to the point where sleep was sacrificed and affected me tremendously on the last morning (and I ended up taking a 5 hr nap when I got home before doing some reading and then sleeping again). I totally believe that it was God’s plan that although my first roomate Angela couldn’t make it, Anna had a bed to sleep on…and although I was kinda wary about sleeping with someone I didn’t really know well (unlike some other roomies), I am really thankful and not a bit regretful for the room arrangements. Tho’ I’m not really close friends with many at CCF, I’m still not fully remembering that it’s my last retreat and term here (which is one reason I went to the retreat even tho I’m kinda phobic with big crowds so I tend to avoid them)…
      

</p><p>
      I didn’t really have time to evaluate much throughout the retreat, mostly because the schedule was so packed with things to do…quiet time with God alone was not spent too well on my part (which was done when I got home), but definitely time with God as one fellowship was not missed. I believe that many of us felt God’s presence and power amongst the fellowship throughout the weekend. Most would say that one had a powerful time of praising and worshipping Him, but as I told Becky, I don’t trust my emotions when it comes to music becuase of the effects music has on people in general, so I don’t really get too carried away anymore (ever since WC’97 i think). However, I definitely felt the Holy Spirit in our time of “corporate” prayer–when the fellowship united together as a whole to pray for an individual. Although I personally would’ve like to have seen the sharing part of the program to begin a l’il earlier in the evening (started past 21h00 so many of us were not completely alert by the time 1h00 rolled around), the frank honesty and the willingness of the people who did share really reflected our theme of unity and fellowship. If I discerned correctly, I think what ended up being said affected one or more individuals deeply, which reminded me to silently pray for him/her/them as the fellowship lifted another brother in prayer.
      </p>



<p>
      I think as one put it, retreat was more “fun” in the years before, but when it came to evaluating it on a spiritual level, this one was indeed jam-packed. The games that the rec team came up with really helped team-spirit and “bonding” :). And, although one sister really offended me in her actions when her team lost one round during a game, I *had* to give her the benefit of the doubt and come to terms in forgiving for I  don’t know what she meant by her actions–if she realises that her gestures closely resembles an intentional curse at the party the gesture is directed to in American Sign Language.  I remember protesting to our teammates in shock, “She just swore at us!” and one gal replied, “Oh, she’s like that.” Greeeat. In terms of facilities at Countryside, I do believe that this one had more to offer, 10 rooms with 2 beds per room and ensuite bathrooms?! Luxury! (tho’ some of us suffered through cold showers due to lack of hot water). The rest of them shared bunkbeds but luckily, the lodge had heat and the bathrooms were indoors, unlike Maplegrove…I still don’t know all 76 attendees, or their names, but at least I know at least one more than I began the retreat with (yes, I’m ending a sentence with a preposition). One regret, my digicam..is STILL in the shop.</p>

		<p>				The
          Purpose Driven Church a second-chance, I’ve come to conclude
          that it’s not him that I have a problem with (in fact, his methodology
          is quite good), but more of the churches that implement his strategies
          and suggestions that give people, like myself, a negative impression
          of his efforts. [end of abstract]
Although the book’s target audience seems to be directed at pastors
          or leaders of churches that desire to grow, someone attending one of
          the churches that model after <a href="http://www.saddleback.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Saddleback</a>
          (Warren’s church) should read it to better understand the basis of some
          key or repeated ideas.
I know I’m known to criticize churches, including my own, who adopt
          Warren’s idea a l’il too readily. Carbon-copies of resources are used,
          which makes me wonder if the church wants to <i>be</i> Saddleback. Thankfully,
          over the years, most churches have moved away from replicating and imitating
          the exact ideas of Rick Warren’s church from lesson models (e.g CLASS,
          magnify/mission/membership/maturity/ministry) down to the guest welcome
          card. I think churches were a lil over-zealous to succeed and neglected
          to read his plea: “To understand many of the methods in this book, you
          need to understand the context in which they were developed. Otherwise
          you may be tempted to copy things we did without considering the context.
          <i>Please do not do this!</i> Instead, look beneath the methods to see
          the <i>transferable</i> [emphasis mine] principles on which they are
          based” (27).
A concept that I never fully understood is the CLASS (or the baseball
          diamond) model. Yes, the material in each class is quite good, but what
          if one moves and attends another church that uses the same model? Will
          the material not overlap? I’ve attended at least three churches long-term
          that use the CLASS idea, and at each church, I am overcome with a sense
          of pure dread of the high possibility of having to endure repeated teachings
          (not even sure if it’s in a “fresh” way), echoing the same objectives.
Another oversight that I see churches often doing is the way the sermons
          or services are prepared. Warren emphasizes that “both verse-by-verse
          (book) exposition and verse-with-verse (topical) exposition are necessary
          in order to grow a healthy church.” Hrm. I’m glad he said that because
          otherwise, based on my experiences, I would’ve thought he only encouraged
          topical teachings as being crucial to success. The few churches that
          supports <i>the Purpose-Driven</i> model that I’ve attended seem to
          focus on topical teachings 90% of the time. Topical teaching (ie. sermon
          that focuses on one topic, such as God and Suffering for example) has
          its place and time as does focusing a sermon on a particular passage
          of the Bible. One problem that I have with topical teaching is that
          I often find the sermon quite shallow. Perhaps it’s because services
          tend to be more “seeker-friendly/sensitive” but verses to support points
          raised are seemingly pulled from all-over-the-place in the Bible. I
          often wonder what the context of the verses are written in and if they’re
          used in the right context (eg. Rev 3:20 is arguably used in a wrong
          context quite often)…
During the time that <i>the Purpose-Driven</i> model got popular,
          Bibles were also being slowly phased out. I’ve learnt that at in at
          least three churches I’ve been to, one does not need a Bible, for all
          the biblical references are printed in one’s outline or on the projected
          on the screen; therefore, one’s Bible can continue to sit on the shelf
          and collect dust. With technology comes convenient I suppose, but I
          also wrongly assumed and blamed it on Rick Warren’s teaching. Well,
          he suggests that idea I guess, but he also notes that in his church,
          they place Bibles in front of each seat so that they can all follow
          along on the same page.
Well, on the bright side, at least there is somewhat of uniformity
          amongst different churches across North America…haah, almost cult-like
          if you ask me. Thankfully, I don’t have to come to terms with a replicate
          Saddleback church at the church I serve at in Waterloo, but I know it’s
          inevitably avoidable to keep running away from them, especially if a
          church ministers to my needs and offers a place where I can serve at…
And in conclusion, I’ve decided that I’m not against Rick Warren or
          how Saddleback Church works, but rather, how <i>other</i> churches misrepresent
          them.]]>		</p>

		<p>				Jon
        C came down from Mac to visit some friends this weekend. Though I
        didn’t spend too much time with him, Becks, Jon, and I had lunch together
        at Philthy McNasty’s
        (really, some of the stuff they promote on their “family” menu are questionnable,
        like the ad for the Canadian version of a Maxim-like mag). Come to think
        of it, I’ve never really had lunch with Jon C before when I was back home
        (well, he is 3 years younger I guess). I didn’t spend much time w Becks,
        but it wasn’t too mimimal because she hangs out w my sis.
         Conversation got quite interesting as we were discussing elementary,
          high school, and present crushes (and how certain people invade my dreams
          at night)! Ha, juicy insider stories from first person accounts always
          the best :). I guess it’s especially good when you know the other party/crush
          that the other talks about…

		<p>				 *Food freshness and quality alert!*<br>
          The Math C&D (coffee and donut shop) in MC sells food that is really,
          really old, I guess at a lower price than the variety stores at say,
          the SLC (=MBC at SFU, SUB at UBC). I bet that no one even notices though
          b/c all of them are geeks that “live” in that building and well freshness
          isn’t too important especially if personal hygiene isn’t an issue :P.
          For those that actually care, I went to buy a chocolate bar so to not
          starve myself in a later class. Once I bought the Nestlé Crunch and
          opened it, upon peering at the label, there was some sort of contest
          that closed on 04/x/02. April 2002! Which means that the chocolate wasn’t
          produced in April but at least 4-6 months before the contest-end date
          because the company knows that it takes time to make the labels and
          it takes more time for contestants to purchase chocolate bars. For all
          I know, it could be Hallowe’en candy from 2 Octobers ago! *shudder*.
          And for those that are wondering, Yes, I did eat it in its entirety.
        </p>



<p> Some people keep saying how I seem to know everyone. Speaking of people,
          Jon C came down from McMaster to vist some friends this weekend. Last
          time I saw him was at BAC during Christmas. hehe. I bump into people
          in Toronto I’ve met (even though I don’t live there), I see people on
          campus…and I admit that I have 400+ peeps on one of my ICQ lists (90%
          of which I’ve met in real life). In reality, I don’t think I know that
          many people. I know a <a href="javascript:OpenWindow('http://community.webshots.com/image1/4/78/75/32647875XxspXe_ph.jpg')">friend</a>
          who seems (or useta, I’m not sure how much of a recluse he is now :P)
          to know the entire city of Ottawa. At any rate, I guess I just realised
          how at small this world is once again (so I guess the above is semi-true
          since 6 billion peeps is separated at less than 6 degrees if one does
          the time to do the math). I was looking through a <a href="http://www.gambitstudios.com/Liberty.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GameBoy
          emulator</a> zip file sent by someone (oh yah, I can play Bomberman
          now too on my Palm :P) and noticed a name and e-mail address belonging
          to Ka-Lok Fung (he useta go to BAC back in the days). I was like, WHA?
          So, I quickly ICQed Ka-Lok to see if it was him who worked on it partially,
          and apparently it is…
        </p>



<p>Déjà vu! Gabriel Chan spoke to CCF last night. I remember him speaking
          many years before. I gotta say that he improved :). What’s more is that
          Peter Lau (both from AFC) is our speaker once again for the retreat
          (he was ours 2 years ago). Hopefully the talks will be different, even
          though the theme is somewhat similar…</p>

		<p>				You are the first thing I think of in the morning. You
        are the last thing I think of at night. And guess who’s on my mind every
        minute in between!” (278)
        

</p><p> My, what cheese! Hahah. I guess I’m not really the dreamy romantic
          type :}. My parents got me a “textbook” entitled <i><a href="http://www.amazon.ca/exec/obidos/ASIN/0735202346/701-9015474-3440305" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">How
          to Say It</a></i> by Rosalie Maggio for Christmas (dunno what they’re
          trying to tell me here, but it’s useful to say the least–especially
          to Jetsgo! :P) There’s everything from Letters of Acceptance to Letters
          of Welcome. I haven’t gone through the entire book yet, but yesterday,
          we had a résumé workshop held by CCF, so I came back to read what the
          book had to say on résumé writing (and hints on active verbs, adjectives
          to use, etc.). Just so happened to stumble upon the section that said
          Love Letters. Does one really need to be taught how to write love letters?
          What’s even more amusing is it teaches one how to “stalk”:
        <i> When writing to someone who doesn’t (yet!) love you as
          you love them, be brief rather than long. Retain some emotional distance…Don’t
          move too quickly. Instead of inviting the other person to go camping
          with you, ask if they’ve ever done much camping, what they thought of
          it…Your goal is much like that of a letter of application: you don’t
          aim to get the job, you want to get the interview. You present yourself
          as a warm, bright, funny, interesting person so that you can keep the
          person’s interest long enough to present yourself as a candidate for
          their love.</i> (276)
        If anyone tries to pull that one, I’ll know where they got it from. Since
        most of my words today are merely quotes, I may as well note that Michael
        W. Smith’s song and title of his last contemporary album, “<a href="javascript:%20OpenWindow('http://grove.ufl.edu/~aquarius/mwsmithyourtime.html')">
        This is Your Time”</a> is dedicated to Cassie, the girl who died for Christ
        at the Columbine shootings. I guess I never really noticed how much those
        words correspond to that event until I read the lyrics last term.
        </p>



<p> In closing, I leave you with this (I took liberties to change the
          sentence into poetic form):
         <i>I feel more intensely alive,<br>
          More intensely real,<br>
          More intensely myself<br>
          Since I met you. </i>
          </p>



<p><i> As if a dimming filter has been removed,<br>
            The world suddenly shouts with bright colours,<br>
            Sharply outlined shapes,<br>
            Evocative scents,<br>
            Intriguing textures,<br>
            Music, laughter, flashes of joy.<br>
            You.</i> <br>
            (Maggio 278)</p>
