		<p>				Pizza
As we were driving soemwhere, we were stopped by some crazy pizza guy asking us if we’d like to buy a slice of pizza. We decline. In the distraction, I did not notice that my shoulder bag was taken until much much later at a mall. When discovered, I went frantic retracing my steps and spent a time and a half looking for it until my friend Alberta told me that her bag got stolen too, and asked me if I remembered any weird fake pizza guys trying to sell me pizza. I luckily found the pizza guy, and demanded that I wanted my purse back. I asked him why he did that and he said it wasn’t to sell the items; and I said, well he could easily make a profit, and proceeded to offer him $50 for the return of my possessions (I did not want to buy a new cell phone, or go through the hassle of applying for new credit cards, etc so i figured I would sacrifice $50). He “kindly” was willing to accept $40, so he showed me to his place and told me to pick it up and left me there. He actually trusted me enough to leave me there. So, Ben Cheung ended up following me and found me there shortly after. He came in (against explicit instructions not to touch anything else), we copied down the mailing address from bills/envelopes, thinking in mind that we were gonna report this, and Ben helped me carry out my friend’s bag as well. On the way out, the pizza boy’s housemate came in (who was an accomplice in the “pizza” scam). I quickly hurried Ben C out the door, but the guy’s suspicion arouse when he saw that Ben C was carrying a similar Bay bag as me (which contained my stuff) on the front lawn, so we quickly walked back to where the car was parked (in a garage).
Upon entering the car, I think Ben C suddenly turned into my uncle in HK or somehow was replaced. Anyhow, we were to drive 2 other girls someplace, so we met them in the garage. The odd thing was that the girl was bringing her mom/aunt to the salon and we commented that the sun looked like it was setting at 7:56 AM. The girl took control of the wheel (which was available in the 2nd row (weird, there was an option where the wheel can be controlled from the back seat) and drove to the street where hair salons were popular, ‘cept we couldn’t find the one she was looking for and everyone other one had at least 4 other ladies waiting (and the girl told her mom/aunt that there usually was on average, 2 people in line).
It somehow shifted in me thinking whether Tim Chin was taking any hair design courses this year (as a part of an archeticture elective),and then I found out that he wasn’t until the year after.
 
Then I awoke. And now my thigh muscles are really sore for some odd reason.]]>		</p>

		<p>				
Much like how many of you may be scratching your heads at the picture above, I am puzzled at society’s notion of love. As I was chattin’ with a friend the other day, we came to the conclusion that the secular media promotes mostly one type of love, and that is sexual love. There is no other. Love is lust. And, if you were thinking all along that the guy in the above scene is a the one I love, you’re right in one sense. The guy is my brother and this was normal when we were many years younger. Yes, if all of a sudden, you feel the urge to puke because you imagined another scene (blech. incest!), this just proves my point. Secular media has infused the images and associations of sexual love into our living; thus, easily confusing other types of love as being sexual love. The affectionate and intimate type of love as described above, I would like to term as being familial love. I would dare say that familial love does not only exist within the four walls of the family unit, but outside of it as well, in other relationships, especially in the Christian community. I am not saying that the above scene is the idea of a model relationship between Christian brothers and sisters, but the affectionate intimacy between certain individuals  can and may co-exist. I feel that familial love is closest to agape love (unconditional love), the love that is capable by and through God alone. In a healthy family unit, most family members would stand up for their own flesh and blood (e.g. parents loving their children almost unconditionally, etc.) more likely than for an outsider. Parallelling that concept, God’s love (agape) is far better than that–the love the loves unconditionally (forever no matter what). Secular’s protrayal of sexual love? Lust (time and not to mention body appeal shall tell).

<p>
Something amusing happened today, which reminds me of this picture that was taken last week:
</p>



<p>
Bump into Frosh1:<br>
Frosh1: Are you going to grad dinner?<br>
Me: Yep. I’m graduating!<br>
Frosh1: … You are?!?….I thought you were only in second year…<br>
Me: Nope, but it’s okay, most people mistake me for a frosh anyhow <br>
(in my mind: tho’ the froshes likely won’t because they don’t recognise me as being “one of them”, therefore the next likely “level” would be second year)<br>
…
<br>
Time passes, bump into Frosh2:<br>
Me: Hey, that looks like Genetics.<br>
Frosh2: Yep.<br>
Me: Fun, fun, yuck. I hated that course.<br>
Frosh2: Really? What year are you in? Second?<br>
Frosh1: No, I just asked her that! She’s graduating this term…<br>
Frosh2: You are?!…Sorry, I didn’t know what year you were in…
</p>



<p>
Well, at least I got promoted a year today mostly because of the reason as stated above. 🙂</p>

		<p>				God of Wonders, it brought me back to thinking ’bout Columbia (see previous post in February). The pictures of the view from space showed a small glimpse of what it must’ve looked like to wake up to the view of space and to the song <i>God of Wonders</i>. I had the urge to share that story when they played it so afterwards, I told Vonne and Chris :P.
      

</p><p align="center">
       </p>


	

<p>
      Found Willis’ tree after sweeping the snow off the plaque. Looking kinda limp and bare. I guess the long winter had some toll on it. Showed it to Chris and told him the story. On another note, I had no idea that UW actually has places that look half-decent. I guess I haven’t been to Dana Porter library for about 2 years now, so I didn’t know that they completely changed the basement. Wow, it actually looks nice! So, I think the interior design of the basement outbeats my liking for the new part of the SLC. The rest of the campus is downright ugly.
      </p>



<p>
      I <i>feel</i> more than I let on. Pray for me for the following two items:
      

</p><ul><li>Important appointment on Friday with someone. Hope that goes well.</li>


      

<li>I might get a job interview with a company in ‘sauga. They called lookin’ for me today ‘cept I was in class…right now, it’s just phone tag, so we’ll see what God has in store.</li>


      </ul>


      Thanks! Oh yeah,  I realise that I shouldn’t be complaining about Jetsgo as much. Seemingly, United Airlines put <a href="http://joannechan.blogspot.com/2003_02_23_joannechan_archive.html#89885870" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Joanne Chan</a> through such a trying experience that my complaint is like a measly fly on the wall, waiting to be squashed.

		<p>				Dream from October 20, 2001:</p>

<font color="maroon">


<p>I woke up on Saturday morning to a phone call (that I did not answer), and fell back asleep to dream yet again. This time, my sister (or some Chinese girl that I can’t pinpoint) and I exited a building before a portion of it blew up. At that point, I had a distinct impression that part of my elementary school exploded. Someone lady in charge proceeded to guide us away from the building, and pointed us toward the school bus that we were supposed to board. Upon boarding, we were all given a sweatshirt (to keep warm? to change into? I’m not quite sure). As we rolled along for what seem like a long time, I suddenly wondered where we were going and why the bus driver did not tell us of the destination. Coincidentally, there was a schedule of who booked the bus and for what occasion on the window of my seat. I tried to read it, but because it was posted toward the exterior of the bus, the typeset was mirrored. Luckily, the girl in the opposite seat behind me carried a compact with her and kindly lent it to me to decipher all the words. The strange part was that for the week, no company booked it and that cause me bewilderment. I suddenly had this thought, “What if they had in mind to take us someplace of no return?” In my mind, I was praying that God would show us what to do and how to escape. It must’ve been God’s plan, because I arranged to ask the driver to let us off at the next stop for a pee break. </p>




<p>The bus stopped at the mall. I proceeded to tell my sister to gather up her belongings and follow me. The had a mall that was 10 stories in height and the main public washroom was on the 3rd floor. As people went to the third floor, we proceeded to adventure higher and further away from the bus as to avoid getting on the bus again. We reached the 7th floor and managed to find a clean, private bathroom before locking ourselves in and looking down to see the bus still parked. A realisation hit me then. Why did they give us the sweatshirts for? Another thought occurred to me. What if they wanted us to wear them beacuse they contained a homing device?! Uh-oh. We panicked. We weren’t proven wrong when the guy from the bus tried to open the door to the bathroom (and I proceeded to scream) so he quickly closed it and waited for us to finish whatever we were doing and waited outside the door for us. We waited forever behind the closed door for him to go away, but we realised that he wasn’t until we came out. So, we came out and acted all surprised to see him there waiting for us (“how did you find us?”) and allowed him to escort us back to the bus so we could all begin the journey to the unknown once again. </p>




<p>At that point, I realised that my theory wasn’t full of holes. I eagerly hoped, anticipated, and waited for the next stop because I figured that there would be more people wanting to use the lavatories as well. Surprisingly, we stopped at another mall. This one had a theatre in the middle of it. My sister and I gathered up what we had, and exited the bus, praying that it would be the last time. We went into the main bathroom, changing out of our sweatshirts and placing it inside the stalls, so that whomever was tracking us would think we were still in the washroom. We cut through the theatre and wandered to another bathroom. After what seemed like a prolonged period of time to make sure that no one would be coming after us, we bumped into the bus guy (or maybe it was another guy), but this time, he told us that the woman let him go (i.e let him free) before starting the bus again so we didn’t have to worry. I had a nagging suspicion that some kids in the mall might have taken those 2 sweatshirts and proceeded to venture off with them before the bus lady appointed another escort to guide them “back” into the bus. Even though I felt bad, at least we were free. So, we decided to watch a movie. Upon entering the movie, for some reason, I introduced the guy to the theatre staff. He said beneath his breath, “That’s funny, I know him by another name.” Uh-oh. Not another trick? But, before I found out, I awoke. </p>

		<p>				
      Dear Mr. _____,
      </p>



<p>
	  I am writing to express my utmost dissatisfaction with the service of Future Shop, Store #608.</p>



<p>
	  As portrayed in your marketing media, Future Shop prides itself in satisfying its customers. Although your products are generally top-quality, customer service standards at this particular store notably falls below its competitors’ and the company’s website claim in being “committed to helping Canadians get MORE out of the technology they buy.” I beg to differ, notably when a customer is without a digital camera for almost 3 months, notwithstanding the money spent on alternatives, such as film and the cost of development, which totalled close to $100.</p>



<p>
	  From December 12, 2002 until February 25, 2003, Future Shop sent my digital camera to be serviced (under manufacturer’s warranty). As a customer, I expect warranty repairs to be completely taken care of by Future Shop. Unfortunately, my experience with your store serves to prove the complete opposite.
	  </p>



<p>
	  Granted, certain individuals (namely Jen) tried to answer my many questions, but a wild goose chase could not be avoided. Eventually, I contacted the manufacturer, who helped me much more than Future Shop did. Due to Open Box purchase policies, Fuji informed me that it was waiting for an authorization from Future Shop before proceeding with repairs. To my dismay, your database had been showing incorrect information for the previous 6 weeks (that it was at the manufacturer’s with parts replaced); thus, falsely misleading the Distribution Centre (Chantal), your employees, and as a result, the customer.
	  </p>



<p>
	  On the 8th week, I spoke with Paul Thompson (Sales Manager) in person, but he failed to deliver his promise; that is, to find out what happened. When the camera finally arrived, 2 days before the 11th week, your employees lost the paperwork that explained the details of the repair. I had to contact Fuji myself and in the process, learned that the authorized repair only took 2 days–as opposed to 11 weeks–where time and money were preciously lost while the customer waited. To think that if the customer did not intervene with the repair process, the camera could still be sitting at the manufacturer’s to this very day.  Furthermore, the warranty has long since expired; thus, preventing further warranty coverage should a problem arise due to any mishandling during the repair process.
	  </p>



<p>
	  Furthermore, I would also like to note the carelessness of Future Shop. Not only are there obvious scratches on my camera, which were not present before the repair, but also attention to detail is clearly lacking. Under Accessories on the Unit Information form, it mistakenly states that a Carrying Case was included with the camera. Understandably, upon its return, one would have the right to demand for the production or a compensation for the “missing” case–a tempting thought for one who endured this disappointing experience with your store.
	  </p>



<p>
	  Unless Future Shop raises customer service standards, I will not hesitate to share my disappointing experiences with other customers in the surrounding area.
	  </p>



<p>
	  Thank you for your kind attention to this matter. If you have any questions, comments, or require further details, please do not hesitate to contact me. I understand that customer satisfaction is valuable to companies such as yours. I appreciate your strive for quality customer care and trust that you will want to see that such an incident does not occur again.
	  </p>



<p>
	  Sincerely,<br>
	   ________</p>

		<p>				<font color="maroon"><em>Knives, Guns, and Men.</em></font></p>




<p>While noting that a passenger tried to sue an airline company for not landing correctly and thus, destroying a potential engagement/marriage, I remember being in a house where three people were under the strict orders of a head boss. The boss could order his henchmen around and morph into other bodies. I was related to these people some how but I don’t know how.</p>




<p>During a period of questionning, he called someone and tested his men out by asking who he was calling. I, like Dark Angel, knew how to decipher touch-tones on the telephone and figured out that he was calling my Gong-Gong and so I mouthed it to them. Yet after the millisecond call to Gong-Gong, their phone begin to ring. Somewhere along the wires of the phone, the head boss managed to speak through the voice of Gong-Gong and dial his henchmen’s phone. One of the guys looked at me said to his boss, “Are you calling me?” I urged on with my eyes to them to pick it up. Thus, in the voice of Gong-Gong, the boss managed to talk to one of them and exchanged his body for the henchman’s and went off to do some crime.</p>




<p>Meanwhile, I had a l’il boy with me. I don’t think he was mine, but I was in charge of taking care of him. I went outside of the house and assessed the situation. I sensed a forboding presence of danger nearby so I told him to lay low and hide (to protect him). He suggested that he would climb to the top of a building so to keep safe and be able to see what’s going on. I didn’t exactly like that idea but I knew that if he was on the roof of a building, the chances of someone seeing him would be slimmer than if he went to a basement or a ditch to hide, so I let him go.</p>




<p>As I was walking down the sidewalk in broad daylight, a skinny man started following me. I knew who he was as I’ve met him in my days before and he was trouble. I let him know that I clearly did not want him around but he kept coming after me. Thus, I broke into a run. When I did that, he took out his knife and started slashing at me.</p>




<p>Ahh, the pain seared through as the knife sliced through the flesh on my back. I started screaming and yelling in pain and running harder. I retreated back into the house, where one of my brothers in fighting (the henchmen) threw me a knife to use when I got to the porch. At that, my psychotic stalker started to laugh and taunt that I would never have the guts to use the knife because I didn’t know how to use one. Admittedly, he was right. I didn’t like the fact that my bro gave me a weapon because I knew the chances of it being used against me was quite high. The psycho started to make wild grabs at my knife and in attempt to prevent that from successfully happening, I slashed air in all randomness and ran.</p>




<p>Finally, I did manage to take a stab at something as I stuck it backwards. It must’ve been him b/c he released his hold or his attempt for a millisecond. Somewhere along those lines, I also managed to get an automatic or some other gun that fires rounds w/o running out of ammunition too easily. I fired some shots, in self-defense, most of which missed him, but some hit his upper body, but never really killing him, just injuring him enough to lag and persist on…</p>




<p>I don’t know how that ended, but I’m alive today, thank God! (Aside: Does anyone know why my font colour isn’t showing up properly? 😐 )</p>

      As I was doing a Bible study on “Sustaining Grace” tonight, the passage of focus was Psalm 23. One question that Bill Hybels (and co.) made the reader ponder upon is why at the start of the fourth verse, the subject/voice changes from He to You. I still don’t know why…
      </p>



<p>
      Another notable is that if you notice the way that David writes the Psalm, he uses the verb “walk” (dunno if it’s same in Hebrew, but Boy might be able to check it out–speaking of the l’il Boy, berfday wishes to him!) to get through the valley of the shadow of death (or darkness), not running or sprinting through–which may imply that it takes time, patience, and persistance to go through and out of the valleys of life. Another association with walking is the indication of being calm (for evil is not to be feared) as opposed to running for your life.

     Hrm. I seem to have a sustaining bruise from snowboarding since Jan 03,2003. The plastic on the boot kept pressing on my shin and it tore a piece of skin off (like you really wanted to know that) which resulted in a bruise. The scab has since fallen away, but the bruise and the pinkish mark since remains. Must I agitate it to make it dissipate?! Siigh…

     LOL. Frankly, I’m quite amused. Tonight, the same girls from downstairs called our house and Eunie answered the phone. Apparently, one of them failed a midterm last week alledgedly because we were so “noisy” and she/they couldn’t sleep. If I remember correctly, last week i) Eunie wasn’t here and ii) all of us were so busy that we had no time to chit chat. I was in my room practically the whole week doing assignments and studying myself. And no one else was home much either. Oh, not to mention that we did not receive ANY noise complaints last week either…She told Eunie that they really didn’t know what to do to filter out the “noise” (okay, I admit that maybe this week is louder than last but I don’t see any justification for last week)…shall I suggest getting earplugs? Or perhaps, moving out to say, Shakespeare (tho’ the rent is twice as much as ours) where the walls are much thicker and there is carpet in every apartment!?

Ah yes, guess what? Not only can The Flash Mind Reader read your mind, I can read your mind too! If anyone wants the solution on how that is possible, give me a shout. 🙂 Funny, how <a href="http://dantey.blogspot.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DanTe</a> needed to code a program for it before he found out how it worked :P.

Aside: Weird, what’s up w the Chan_’s bdays this week? Happy berfday to them all: M Chang (3rd) <a href="http://chinksunited.blogspot.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">D Chan</a> (4th) C Chan (5th) and D Chan (8th)…</p>

		<p>				Since I have subscribers for no apparent reason, I’ll just add some of my dreams that I have here every so often just to entertain the readers who do bother visiting…most of which, if not all, can be found on my other site 🙂 And now, I present to thee, the other side of my consciousness…</p>

<font color="#660000">


<p><b>Sunday, December 13, 1998</b> </p>




<p>In my dream during an afternoon nap, someone asked a question to another person. In response to an answer regarding the strangest question (“What is defined as a being a couple?”), she told a story. I would like to share the same story with you (only 1 minor alteration: Johnny and Karen originally got married at the end because she had said that she would agree to go out with anyone who lifted her up in her time of need).
</p>



<p>When Johnny was a little boy, he would sit on the stairs in his apartment all the time. The girls from below knew that a boy sat on the stairs and they would make it a game and take turns peering into the dark stairway. Upon seeing his usually swollen face, they would run out and cry. They had the biggest cry from Johnny most of all. What they didn’t know was that Johnny watched each girl run safely into their mothers’ arms and wept in their embrace. You see, Johnny didn’t have that kind of a mother. His mother hit him and slapped him, and that is why he was always sitting in the quiet of the stairs with the bruises and scars on his face. It was the only place of solitude. </p>




<p>As years went by, Johnny saw less and less of the girls. One day, one of the girls, Karen, ran into the bottom of the stairs silently sobbing. Although Johnny had been hurt the most, he came from above and placed his arms around her letting her weep her tears onto his shoulder. This time, the girl didnt run away. She finally understood.</p>

		<p>				“What is truth?” Pilate asked. (John 18:38a NIV). Indeed, what is truth? Jesus says in the verse before, “You are right in saying I am a king. In fact, for this reason I was born, and for this I came into the world, to testify to the truth. Everyone on the side of truth listens to me.” So, was Pontius Pilate asking this question with a tone of sarcasm–a mere rhetorical question that needs not an answer because truth here didn’t matter for Pilate had the power to have Jesus crucified? Or, is his question a dismissal of truth because truth may be all relative? Finally, perhaps, Pilate was sincerely seeking the answer for truth, to which I hope he eventually found it. Today, I pose this question to you: what is truth?

Oh yes,the DM came up twice yesterday, as noted on my l’il godsis’ blog. The second time, he threatened to fine us $50 if he had to come up again. Hrm. I do want to note that the noise level complaint has ceased since Eunie left 2 weeks ago, until yesterday–since she’s come back for her reading week. I would like to say that there is a correlation…she denies it, of course! hehehe 😐 …Oh, happy berfday, Lemon!</p>
