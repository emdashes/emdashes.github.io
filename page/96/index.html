        has a totally new haircut–if she dyed the tips, she’d be like an animé
        character! cute :).
        

</p><p>By
          the time we finished, it was time to head over to Pac Mall to MHQ to
          go K-ing. Rice pleasantly surprised me/us all by showing up on the spot
          🙂 and DD (Terence–note the spelling :P) joined us as well as GK Yam,
          Kenneth, Lillian, Christine (both froshies), and later, DD-jai (David).
          Ended up singing in Mandarin, Cantonese, and English. Not much English
          songs though. Mike’s @ Metrotown has a greater selection :). Many of
          them sang well (or was it just all of us suxed?)–nevertheless, it was
          fun! 😛 I can’t believe that they had the song I learned as a kid: “Xiao
          Tai Yang” (“Tai Yerng See Gor Dai Lam Gua”)–and that only Bonnie and
          I seemed to know it (wow, I must’ve been very fobbily raised)! Most
          likely b/c I like to go K-ing. First time in TO. 4th or 5th time in
          total. Good price though: $44/hr per room but can order anything up
          to $44 for free. Took some really odd pix. Hehehe.
        </p>



<p> Chi
          Feh (Vonne/Shanghai-nese for “Eat Rice”): DD and Rice and DD-jai joined
          us for din-din at this awesome Shanghai place; stuff I loved as a kid!
          “Ngun Si Goon”, “Fun Yu” (which we didn’t end up ordering), Band-aids
          (or fried “lian gou”) … and stuff I have never had: deep-fried bananas,
          fried egg-wrapped red bean paste stuff, salty veggies and ham, and the
          standard shanghai noodles, and yummy “drunken” chicken. DD needed to
          meet up w his friendz after so he left us and the rest of us went to
          World Bowl to bowl. I really need work on my bowling skillz but hey,
          at least it was fun and I DID end up beating one of the better players
          (Kev joined us for bowling) in the second round…heheh 😛
        </p>



<p> Left
          about 22:11 for Waterloo. Marcy drove for the whole trip: thx Mumbles!
          🙂 I hope DD and Rice had fun b/c I know they didn’t really know my
          friends very well. In fact, I didn’t know DD-jai too too well either
          but it was fun gettin’ to know him more :). MisterChan (yes, a VERY
          good read! thx MC tho this might match it), Bun, Marcy, and Rice all
          blogged about our weekend so if there’s any overlap, you’ll understand
          why :D.
        </p>



<p> Left
          Waterloo behind at about 15:00 the next day. Kinda feels weird to leave
          Vonnekins behind–she felt like my lil sis for awhile –even though
          she’s like older than me by 1/2 a month :P. She borrows my clothes,
          shoes; I share my furniture, etc. And our term w the Prayer Partner
          meetings went really well :). Marcy helped me drive my stuff back up.
          Ended up in Ottawa at about 22:00 and went to Local Heros w Ginny, Angela,
          Matt, Rog, Irene, Derrick, J, and Marcy to eat their wings this evening.
          Yum! But one complaint: it’s SOOO cold here! -4 C!? It was about 30C
          in Water, last week! 🙁
        </p>



<p>Rice
          and I were talking the other day and he mentioned something really striking
          that stuck in my mind for a few days. Sometimes, we just can’t tell
          who are Christians and who aren’t. Some of my non-Christian friends
          act, speak, behave, and are more “moral” than some Christians I know.
          Hypothetically speaking, if it wasn’t for that fact that they don’t
          know my best friend, Jesus, I’d probably choose to go out w them over
          the Christian guys I know any day. So then, what makes a Christian and
          a non-Christian different?</p>

          Wow, 2 days and I'll be done! Crazy. No job yet STILL. Studied on
          my own today. Kept falling asleep b/c I was bored to death. I ended
          up finishing reviewing by dinner and went home to procrastinate
          for the rest of the night. Lunch w my friends from 1st year tomolo
          :). Oh, I'm supposed to say that this is your last chance to "declare"
          your interest in going to K-ing at 15:00 on the 21st--likely at
          MHQ (or HMQ, whatever it's in Pac Mall). Right now we have: F, V,
          T, E, B, M, G, and maybe J, C, and L going. If I don't hear from
          you by tonight, then it's over! :P

          wrote an article about reality TV show: The
          Bachelor. What a silly show, Hollywood marriage ... if I was
          the girl that got chosen, I'd marry him, then divorce him to get
          the money. He's not worthy of anyone to begin with; just read his
          online journals--they seem quite superficial. Actually, I wouldn't
          ever sign up for a contest like this b/c you gotta sign a waiver
          form to waive your rights of privacy. So, that means there might
          be hidden cameras while you're showering and stuff ... er ...</p>

		<p>				other pool. Played pool w Bonnie,
              Vonne, and Terence today. Thx Sponge! Had dinner at Irish pub @
              18:30 or so til about 20:45 w V, B, F, and DD (the other one)–wow,
              what a long break. This morn’ I, ahem, “released the airplane” on
              Rice (and DD?) by not showing up @ noon at the SLC. Sollie! I forgot
              that I had to stay home to clean the house: inspections comin’ up
              soon and other housemate is leaving tomolo! Surprisingly, I’m not
              sore from ball yesterday–think it’s cuz I played previously twice
              earlier during the week and “suffered” for it 🙂
            




              After their exam, DD and Rice showed up and DD joined me to study,
              ‘cept I kept falling asleep ’til Kit called (thankfully!). I dunno
              why. I think I was exhausted from cleaning and ball(?) b/c earlier
              today, DD snuck up on me and took 2 pics of me sleeping w/o me realising!
              ={ (at least the first one he did). Sigh . . . and to be fair, it’s
              posted in my album. 😛 You can find it yerself if you’re interested.
              Also took a pic w my <a href="http://community.webshots.com/photo/35918563/35942470ABEUUP" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">uncle</a>
              (so it’s a distant relative . . .), who’s only 1 year older than
              me tho he’s doesn’t look old at all! =P
            




              At 23:30, we called it a day, and play a couple more rounds of pool
              (thanks again, Sponge!). DD and Dom coached me and DD taught me
              how to position and play properly 🙂 Thanks! =). Now all I gotta
              do is practice in the summer . . . just like how I gotta practice/do
              er, Daytona Xpert, Ballroom Dancing steps (else I’d forget), b-ball,
              bladin’, indoor wall-climbin’ and um. many other things 🙂 Wow,
              I don’t ever recall exam period to be this enjoyable! =) Guess tis
              a good thing that I got 4 exams over with and get a week off to
              study for the last one! I suppose I’m thankful in that sense :D.

		<p>				never exercise or have
              this much healthy fun in Waterloo. I think I might be in muscular
              pain tomolo-hahah :). But I actually enjoy that pain: indicator
              of exercise and a good workout 😉 I really need to improve though.
              My shots are often way-off and I can’t dribble for peanuts. At least
              I don’t hog the ball (ie. I pass). Actually, the team was good at
              passing and stuff . . . the other team kept on hogging the ball
              or would rarely ever pass to Ming, the girl. I kinda felt sorry
              that she didn’t have much of a playing chance (shooting or getting
              passed to) — cept she does good defense in her own lil way. At
              times, I just kinda let her stay open . . .AGH. I wanna play more!!!
              :D.

              Dinner @ Zeke’s was pretty good! My steak sandwich was quite nummy
              🙂 (yes, I spelled it wrong on purpose). Thanks for the recommendation
              DD! Reminds me of Ottawa days. 4 guy and 1 girl–Oh wait, did we
              establish that a certain someone else was a girl too? 🙂 Yaay! so
              that makes it 3 guys and 2 girls 🙂 Perfect!
            </p>

              Went back to the SLC to try to study ‘cept Eric was quite talkative
              today, which somehow got my mood to be talkative as well :P. Sigh.
              BUT, he says he’ll come out tomolo to study as well. I thank God
              that I got to know these guys a lot better this term . . . –they’re
              quite funny esp Rice, when it comes to “stalking” ppl like DD :P.

              My room is a mess. Been packing. Also went to the SLC today to “study”
              and browsed through the book sale (25 cents per book). Herm was
              w Louchez (hey, now I know who he is, though I already forgot his
              face! :{) and bought a few books too. There were some Christian
              titles/publishers. My sister would’ve liked Grace Livingston Hill’s
              books but b/c I don’t like “Christian romance” novels, I didn’t
              get them. There was also books by Marjorie Holms and publishers
              by Bethany House, Moody Press, Zondervan, Revell and others. I ended
              up getting 4: <i>The Pursuit of Holiness</i> (a book that was like
              $9+ dollars when we had our cell group in first year!), a book on
              prayer, <i>Christy</i>, and a book of Aesop’s fables :).
            </p>

              Side note: I’m sadly disappointed that netcomments is down til Saturday,
              so this temporary one will haveta suffice.</p>

		<p>				Brassman,
              the ‘Nucks made it to the playoffs. Yay. Hmm. Algebra was okay today
              … mucho gracais to DD and Rice for helping me understand matrices
              and probability :)! Edit: Thx also to DD for
              the eraser, it worked well for my mistakes 🙂 (heeheh, I found another
              eraser today as I was cleaning my room, so remind me to give yours
              back :P). The guys and I went to Sakura
              Island for lunch–$$$ :(. They didn’t have lunch specials on
              weekends so a lunchbox came close to $22! Thankfully, Rice split
              one w me. If I remember correctly, it was only slightly more expensive
              than Seoul Soul but much better tasting last time (but that was
              a weekday–the box included Tempura, Sushi (or was that on the side?),
              Miso Soup, Garnishes, Salad, and the Meats for approx $12). The
              Bulgogi was tasty though, I must admit. But, having gone there a
              second time, I don’t think I’d go back for evenings or weekends.
              And guys, sorry for the recommendation–didn’t realise it would
              be that over-priced! : | –hmm, maybe Mr. Sushi would be a better
              choice– I will keep that in mind to try next week when I migrate
              to the SLC to study again :).
            

</p><p>
              OH! Vonnekins, Mr. Stats, Marcy, and I <i>might</i> be going to
              TO on the 21st before I leave the ‘loo. The 2 girlz are determined
              to go K-ing (karoke) that day. If interested in joining us, contact
              either me or her 🙂 </p>

              On another note: Ergh, Expert level in Daytona USA, is taking me
              awhile to conquer =(. I think I’ll be a l’il broke by end of study
              period b/c in retrospect, I’ve spent at <i>least</i> 5-10 dollars
              in gaming thus far. Thankfully, another Psych experiment is coming
              up. The extra pay ($6) will fund me :). Unfortunately, been eating
              out like every day too. Gah. Rice/DD was commenting yesterday on
              how I seem to know about or play so many games. Um. Well, I don’t
              play RPG or the such b/c I have no patience for them (Unreal, CS,
              EQ, Quake, Starcraft, DBII, etc.)–takes too long to finish. Actually,
              I think I don’t game much at all, which might change in the summer
              if the place I’m staying at, assuming that I’m staying there, lets
              me use his Dreamcast :P. <font color="silver">edit: I take it back,
              I ain’t staying there no more.</font> Tho, last summer, I ended
              up playing a lot of Mario Kart (and somehow WWF w various ppl?!)
              on Nintendo64 :). On the computer here, I only play Tetrinet and/or
              Word Racer/Graffitti (which I have stopped playing for a while now).
              And at the arcades, Daytona 😛 (o sometimes other games like Time
              Crisis II, DDR, Capcom games/street-fighter style arcades but I
              really ain’t good at all b/c I haven’t played enuff).</p>

              2 of my worst exams are over with. Eric/Jeff/DD, and anyone else
              would’ve probably aced it. The questions were quite easy–if I knew
              the material. However, I’m not entirely sure how I did and even
              though there were only 2 coding questions (14/60 marks), the short
              answers weren’t all that straight forward either; a lot of them
              were quite tricky. They required a ton of thinking as well. I just
              hope I passed it, because if I didn’t, then I don’t pass the course
              =(. I’m thankful that I had a CS major to study w throughout the
              week, but I’m certain that w/o him to bounce off my questions with,
              I would’ve done a LOT worse 🙂 Thanks for help, printing costs,
              and for everyone’s prayers!
            </p>



<p align="left">
              Good news. I know I passed one of my courses already (on the other
              hand, I need to maintain a B average on my core English courses).
              I got back my research paper today (the one I rushed to hand in–full
              of grammatical errors) and considering I didn’t know what I was
              doing and that I didn’t read the related text(s) and finished it
              by pulling a 40 hr all-day/nighter, I managed to get 78%, with a
              lot of criticism on it (reminds me of first year English work–bleh).
              I think the professor was being gracious! God certainly answered
              my prayer :). Thus, I have a 51.1% in that course (it was worth
              45%). I hope I did okay on the final as well, I kinda ran outta
              stuff to say in most of my discussion questions, as expected. As
              usual, I also ended up being the last to finish an English exam.
              Although I missed many classes in that course (because I felt that
              I didn’t learn anything), and didn’t do any of the readings (well
              maybe an ounce but it was so hard to keep up w that book–I’m glad
              I didn’t buy it; I just burnt a copy from the CD and transferred
              it to my Palm for my text reference in class, and the textbook,
              I borrowed from the library–how convenient!), and surprisingly,
              I think I was able to successfully identify the 5 passages correctly
              (of 10) on the exam. I hope the rest of it went okay, even though
              it might sound very “fluffy”. During the exam, I realised that the
              professor actually knew me by name b/c he asked me, by name, if
              I received the exam package yet. Doh. Ah wellz, God has it under
              control :).
            </p>



<p align="left">
              Once again, thanks for your prayers! Continue to pray: Thurs-English
              exam, Fri-essay due, Sat-Math exam, next Sat-English. </p>
