While our babe is still young and doesn’t understand the implications of Halloween, a couple of parents have brought up the topic of Halloween and its influence on young children. Most of our culture today see Halloween as a fun day (much like Zombie walks on other days of the year), not a day to celebrate the undead. j.w even sent me a link on Facebook to <a title="On Halloween" href="http://troublefacemom.com/2012/10/31/on-halloween/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a stranger’s blog post </a>on Halloween and asked for my thoughts, which I responded by saying:


</p><blockquote>My thoughts from 2010: <a href="http://her.happyhippos.ca/2010/11/halloween/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-reactid=".r[1x3oy].[1][3][1]{comment10151961668765419_28951835}.[0].{right}.[0].{left}.[0].[0].[0][3].[0].[0].[1]">http://her.happyhippos.ca/2010/11/halloween/</a><br data-reactid=".r[1x3oy].[1][3][1]{comment10151961668765419_28951835}.[0].{right}.[0].{left}.[0].[0].[0][3].[0].[0].[2]"><br data-reactid=".r[1x3oy].[1][3][1]{comment10151961668765419_28951835}.[0].{right}.[0].{left}.[0].[0].[0][3].[0].[0].[3]">Also, if the kids don’t go trick or treating (unless you go with them, because it would otherwise defeat the get-to-know-your-neighbours motive), it would be nice to have them participate in handing out candy. At our church, we had “harvest” nights, but not necessarily in lieu of trick or treating, as I think it started after dinner; kids could have probably gone to both. These Halloween alternative events were actually quite fun, as there were costume contests and carnival games with tickets to claim prizes at the end of the night (I hated the balloon shaving game though)! Although I didn’t invite any of my friends out (<em>friends</em>?, what friends?), I’m sure other kids did.</blockquote>


Further to my comment, I think the Halloween alternatives in my day were actually a safer place for young children especially, as these costume themes were almost always family friendly; e.g., animals in Noah’s ark. The children weren’t subjected to seeing dead corpses, gory zombies, or other spooky or grotesque characters, though fake, that are meant to scare.  I remember that as a child, I was suspectible to suggestion (or maybe just had a very active imagination); even the snow walkers in Star Wars: the Empire Strikes Back gave me nightmares (I saw these scenes after my supposed bedtime – I was awake and wandered out to the hallway for whatever reason). It also provided a great excuse and venue to dress up in costume, because what other day were you able to do that? (and no, I didn’t know about comic con and other themed cons back then) I also see these events as further protection from the dangers of lighting fireworks on Halloween – while in costume especially! Who knows how many burn or injury stories I’ve heard related to Halloween fireworks – why fireworks is even legal on Halloween is beyond me.
Happened across these verses from Ephesians 5:11-16 (ESV) the night before Halloween, which seemed very Halloween-appropriate:


<blockquote>Take no part in the unfruitful works of darkness, but instead expose them. For it is shameful even to speak of the things that they do in secret. But when anything is exposed by the light, it becomes visible, for anything that becomes visible is light. Therefore it says, “Awake, O sleeper, and arise from the dead, and Christ will shine on you.” Look carefully then how you walk, not as unwise but as wise, making the best use of the time, because the days are evil.</blockquote>


— it even has a zombie-like feel to it when it says, “<em>Awake, O sleeper, and arise from the dead…</em>“! Anyway, while Halloween is probably the one day where it’s explicitly okay for most of our culture to dress up, and church goers frown upon this day, I notice that the above passage mentions day<em>s </em>in plural, not just limited to one day like Halloween. The question is, as Christians, what is our motive when we take part or choose not to participate in such activities? And if it is to set ourselves apart to be in the world but not of the world, do our children understand why? (I felt exclusion and persecution as a child instead of understanding – it was only when I was a bit older that I could consciously voice why I was not actively participating or only taking part in selective activities).]]>

		<p>				For all the nations of the world seek after these things, and your Father knows that you need them. Instead, seek his kingdom, and these things will be added to you. “Fear not, little flock, for it is your Father’s good pleasure to give you the kingdom. Sell your possessions, and give to the needy. Provide yourselves with moneybags that do not grow old, with a treasure in the heavens that does not fail, where no thief approaches and no moth destroys. For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.  – Luke 12:30-34 (ESV)


The above passage was what our Bible study leaders challenged us to memorize after studying <a title="Luke 12:13-34" href="http://mobile.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2012:13-34&version=ESV" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Luke 12:13-34</a> recently. During our discussion, a question about what heavenly and earthly treasures are came about, and while people threw some ideas around, there really was no solid biblical conclusion that the group agreed upon but I have been thinking about what and how to store heavenly treasures as a result. Coincidentally (divinely so), a pastor at the visiting church we attended the following Sunday, touched upon the very same subject! I was really excited and posted this to one of the leaders’ Facebook timeline in real-time (yes, during the sermon as a way to record my notes):


</p><blockquote>The sermon at the church we’re at today is talking about “treasures in heaven” from Matthew 6! Addressing earthly treasures (eg. Love of wealth, status, job, lifestyle, etc.) vs. heavenly treasures (treasures that have eternal value but pastor does mention Bible is not explicit about what heavenly treasures look like though compared God as our treasure, to use what’s/treasures on earth whether it’s money, job, etc. to glorify God)</blockquote>


Then, at our Bible study last week, we went through <a title="1 Peter 2:1-11" href="http://mobile.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Peter%202:1-11&version=ESV" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1 Peter 2:1-11</a>. Two verses stood out to me; one being verse five, which made me wonder if offering spiritual sacrifices is related to storing heavenly treasures:


<blockquote>you yourselves like living stones are being built up as a spiritual house, to be a holy priesthood, to offer spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.</blockquote>




<hr>
And the second verse that stood out? Verse 2:


<blockquote>Like newborn infants, long for the pure spiritual milk, that by it you may grow up into salvation.</blockquote>


I can finally / actually relate how newborn infants long for pure milk!…especially in the first few days after birth. The colostrum that’s nourishes the infant is commonly known as “liquid gold” – implied that it’s filled with nutrients, but I wonder if it can be compared to the purity of liquid gold).]]>

</p><li>joining a Mommy and Me program</li>


	

<li>feeling separation anxiety for the first time when leaving Little Bean with strangers at a church nursery</li>







<h3><strong>Mommy and Me</strong></h3>


As I explained to a few girls at small group before attending the first class, I don’t want to pretend to like other people’s babies as precious as newborns look. But, as mentioned above, it’s usually not as bad, and things end up generally fine. The first week, I didn’t have that problem since our class ended after the speaker finished her topic (natural ways to treat common child health concerns like fevers, rashes, etc.). The second week, the speaker was considerably late, so the mommies interacted with each other and the ice was broken when a couple of new mommies joined the class late and introduced themselves and their babies; the baby I sat beside was older, so I was able to interact with her more while my little one slept through the baby signing class (and didn’t wake up until closer to the end).


<h3><strong>Separation Anxiety</strong></h3>


I’m more familiar with separation anxiety between toddlers and their parent(s), especially on their first day of school, but I distinctly felt some separation anxiety when I left Little Bean at a church nursery for the first time. We didn’t know the helpers/volunteers or how the nursery worked there as it wasn’t our church, so it required some faith on our parts that everything was going to be okay – this church didn’t seem to have a program where they would flag the parents if the little one needed their mommy or daddy (some churches have a call out that appear on the bottom of the slides to summon the parent). It was the first time that I was able to pay attention to the sermon more closely than other weeks when we have her with us, but at the back of my mind, I kept thinking (and watching the clock), is she okay? Is she hungry? (turns out she was at my estimated time, but I didn’t show up until the sermon ended half an hour later. By then, poor girl was a little dazed and very hungry). I probably would’ve felt a little better if I had a better understanding of how the nursery program worked prior to just plopping her down and leaving. But now that I’ve done it once, hopefully it will be easier next time!]]>

A few of us were talking about blogging the other day, and one of them remembered her 15-year-old self on her Xanga days. This actually reminded me about my Xanga account, where I used to log the dreams I would have in my sleep over the years. I went back and logged in (after trying to type a combination of characters several times, in hopes that it was my password), and realize that Xanga had changed. I’m not exactly sure what changed, but it allowed me to download my entries into XML format, so I took up their offer and imported it all (bye, Xanga!). Now, all my entries are on one platform – just keep in mind that when you read an entry and it sounds realistic yet very uncharacteristic, it might be a dream entry – hints that it is a dream:


</p><ul><li>tagged: <a href="http://her.happyhippos.ca/tag/dreams/">Dream journal</a></li>


	

<li>category: Stories</li>


	

<li>no title on the post</li>

</ul>


The movie Inception reminded me of my dream sequences and scenes, so the movie wasn’t all that novel to me. Enjoy but don’t get too creeped out!]]>

I can’t believe that it’s been a year since last Thanksgiving, when we had just <a title="Hi Big Island" href="http://her.happyhippos.ca/2012/11/hi-big-island/">returned from Hawaii</a>. Over the course of the year, our lives have certainly changed (hopefully for the better) – with the arrival of our little one {and if you were wondering like my family did, no, Little Bean isn’t a product of Hawaii}.
And yes, thinking back to the past few months, we have much to be thankful for at this Thanksgiving, including for:


</p><ol><li>Small group: after being without a fellowship or community group for years, our church adopted an existing small group to which we joined in June, and it’s refreshing and good opportunity to know more people at our church on a deeper level.</li>


	

<li>Midwives: We are glad that we decided to go with midwives. I was first introduced to midwives through a friend, who we had lunch with and one of his friends was a midwife. When people asked me why I chose to go with a midwife instead, I made up an answer to the lines of having more personal care. Now, I realize that it’s true, especially since I now have OB care to compare it with as well. With a midwife, you seldom have to wait for more than 10 minutes for your appointment (vs. over 1 hour for my OB once for a 5 minute visit). Midwives also come to your home to evaluate how far along you are and have a backdoor pass to the hospital and your assigned room, so you don’t have to wait for triage, risk being sent back home or sign in; they also come to your home should you need postpartum care, like to address breastfeeding challenges.</li>


	

<li>The nurse: My assigned nurse during delivery was really caring, and the head nurse for the floor, which was super awesome in itself, but we later found out that she actually started in the midwives program, but switched to nursing because she missed the team interaction.</li>


	

<li>Labour wasn’t as painful as I expected despite active labour being long and tiring, even though I have a very low tolerance to pain. I couldn’t take the epidural because of low blood platelet count, which was fine pre-labour and post-delivery { I didn’t really want it but had kept my options open just in case, but He closed that door so I didn’t need to make that choice}.  Afterall, how many people can say that they didn’t even know they were in labour? Divine miracle.</li>


	

<li>A “natural” birth (though assisted with oxytocin to augment labour, local freezing, episiotomy and forceps) that narrowly missed a C-section birth. Divine intervention.</li>


	

<li>The timing of my maternity leave: I couldn’t have predicted or timed it better myself, including how the start of it coincided with delivery [more to come another day]. Divine provisioning.</li>


	

<li>Figuring out our babe’s idiosyncrasies, like her tendency to <em>go </em>when she is placed on a baby rocker chair on loan to us, her dislike for car rides and the seemingly calming effects of the sleep sheep in the car, or her sleep cues and how to soothe her to sleep, and recognizing the consequences that may result if we miss her cues</li>


	

<li>Gently used hand-me-downs from toys, shoes, to clothing all the way to 3 years in sizing!</li>


	

<li>Family and friends who have visited and helped through the first few months of parenthood</li>


</ol>


…and these are just a few of the <em>10, 000 reasons for my heart to find!</em>

My midwife’s words of wisdom applies here: it’s much easier to reflect on a week instead of day by day.  On the positive side, Little Bean has given me some routine:


</p><ul><li>In the mornings, we don’t really get out of bed until after 10AM (even stretching it to 10:30 AM at times), which is SUPER nice</li>


    

<li>If I attend to her when she becomes fully alert, she is usually pretty cheerful, cooing and “talking” in her basket – notably more happy when it’s sunny outside</li>


    

<li>By the time she’s had enough, has her brunch, gets her diapered changed and bum clean (her first poopey diaper of the day), she’s ready for her first nap, which is usually pretty short (~1hr?) but long enough for me to make and eat my lunch. If she’s not ready for a nap, she will happily sit in the baby rocker watching me make lunch at least. Either way, pretty considerate of her 😉</li>


    

<li>Then we go from there. I try to put her down for a second nap so I can get some stuff done around the house, which usually consists of laundry, tidying, or doing some administrative tasks, but lately, she doesn’t seem to want to nap as much so I read to her, try some tummy time, or if it’s nice out, I’ve also taken her in the stroller or the maman kangarou mei tai for example</li>


    

<li>I plan dinner, and eagerly await j.w to come home so I can make dinner. Actually, my parents just gave us an electric pressure cooker, and I’ve discovered that making 1 pot dishes is super fast (e.g. chicken or braised pork belly within 15-30 mins) and convenient because I don’t have to worry about attending to the gas stove when Little Bean demands my attention</li>


    

<li>Eat dinner, then relax a bit. J.w will start her bedtime routine.</li>


</ul>


The challenge: sleep.
I think she takes after her mom and is a night owl; getting her to sleep – especially at night – is probably the biggest challenge right now. She used to be okay if we put her down when she was drowsy and would fall asleep on her own, but we seem to have regressed. At least we now know that when she is really tired, she will seem to want to suck on anything and everything; it doesn’t necessarily mean that she’s hungry. We haven’t really figured out the best way to get her to fall asleep on her own yet. She doesn’t seem to enjoy car rides when she is tired either (results in wailing until she falls asleep and waking up to cry again when the car is stopped at a red light).
Memorable bedtimes in the past week:


<ul><li>9PM: Here I thought that last Monday was bad, when all she wanted was to be held and suck on something all day (and not sleep until 9PM that night, probably due to exhaustion).</li>


    

<li>4AM: But, on Saturday night, she wouldn’t even lie down in our arms and didn’t sleep until 4AM after j.w and I took shifts semi-sleeping. Thankfully, we didn’t miss church!</li>


    

<li>12AM/midnight: I didn’t want a repeat of that yesterday, and thankfully she fell asleep a midnight after multiple attempts at putting her down; finally, I patted her and moved her legs in a bicycle motion and propped her sideways, thinking that if she was in a fetal position, she might feel better if she had gas. At least she slept for the entire night (6hrs)</li>


    

<li>10PM: Tonight, it also took multiple attempts again, but in the end, I stayed with her so that if she jolted awake after she was put down (even swaddled), my hand would still be there – and it seemed to work; she would jolt awake a few times, but go back to sleep shortly after</li>


</ul>


So, there begins weekday life with Little Bean. Sometimes, I take photos or short videos to share the moments I have with her with others, but there are also times where a fleeting laugh or smile is just meant for me to treasure, which reminds me of what the new mother Mary did too – on the significance of her child’s birth, Jesus, as written in <a href="http://biblia.com/bible/esv/Lk2.8-19" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Luke 2:19</a>:


<blockquote> But Mary treasured up all these things, pondering them in her heart.</blockquote>


Oh, stats to note: 9.97lbs (so she’s 10lbs by now at least), 22.8 in long, 15 in head circumference at her first doctor’s appointment at the 8 week mark. While she is under average in weight (but right on track according to her birth weight), she is 85 percentile in length for her gender at the time. Unsurprisingly, she has outgrown her newborn clothes and has moved onto 3 month outfits :)]]>

		<p>				 At the farm – photo by <a href="http://tenpmtea.tumblr.com/post/59364555894" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stephanie K Lu</a>[/caption]
The one month milestone has come and gone, and after hearing that some Koreans and Eastern Europeans are confined in the house for 3 months (which might explain the 100-day celebrations), we celebrated it with a <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">handful </span>sizeable group of family and friends, in a rather unconventional way (I would think) – on a farm! As my mother put it, we seem to have a lot of friends, and God has sure blessed us with a number of people who have supported and encouraged us in this journey into parenthood thus far, as evident in the number of voices echoing that <em>we are blessed </em>and <em>we are committed </em>in bringing up Little Bean in the ways she should go (ref: <a href="https://www.bible.com/bible/114/pro.22.6.nkjv">Proverbs 22:6</a>).
Scripture passages referenced in recent sermons have been a good reminder for me – and a challenge that isn’t going to be easy, with one being:


</p><blockquote>Preach the word; be prepared in season and out of season; correct, rebuke and encourage—with great patience and careful instruction. – 2 Timothy 4:2 (NIV)</blockquote>


Some many years ago, it seemed easier to be like Paul’s time in Athens / Acropolis (ref: <a title="Acts 17:22-24" href="http://bible.us/59/act.17.22-24.esv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Acts 17:22-24</a>) , to naturally direct conversations to more meaningful topics, but I seem to have regressed; instead, I should be prayerfully asking and acting upon such opportunities all the more.
Other little milestones: five-hour sleep cycles at night, with poopy-free diapers! (on a good night, and somehow happens to be on weeknights too!)


<hr>
(also, glad I didn’t have to lie in bed for a whole month, which some have told me that they had to do per their Chinese mother’s instruction!)
