Finished reading 4th book of H.P.; kinda gets foreboding after awhile…unlike Nancy Drew/Hardy Boys mysteries. What kind of youth/juvenile fiction is H.P. categorised under? Horror? Mystery? Also finished <i>A Hundred Secret Senses</i> by Amy Tan. Working on <i>Sophie’s World</i> soon.

Yesterday, Marcy and I went to the Aviation Museum. The planes were pretty cool. There was this one big plane (Lancaster says Marcy) where one gunner sits at the tail of the plane. Boy, do I ever feel sorry for the guy who hadta sit there. One can’t really defend himself in a flyin’ battle. He’s pretty much good as dead if any bullets are aimed at the tail of the plane.

Today, I ended up tutoring my cos in Chinese again, and took my other cos to her first soccer game for the season. We were able to bike there, so it was fun :). I haven’t biked in awhile; ever since I returnd the bike to my friend last year. They won 1-0, but it was funny b/c she didn’t even know they had even scored (she was subbing off for that goal). Meanwhile, I froze my butt off b/c I was only wearing a T, and a light jacket and sat there for 1 hr. Tho’ she went home only in shorts and jersey. I didn’t realise it was gonna be that cold, else I would’ve brought a jacket fer her too (her mom might’ve been disappointed in me in that regard). :{  I think twas as cold as last year’s Canada Day. Currently, w windchill, it’s -4C! 🙁</p>

J taught me one thing: it’s the “pillsbury-doughboy” tickle-smack technique ;). I first I was kinda mad at my myself for “falling” for his lil trick but I soon learned to use it to my advantage 😀 *muahahah*… Also bumped in Andrea, someone my sis and I met at JMC in 97! 🙂 Heheh, when I saw her, I kept whispering to J and Marc asking them what’s her name b/c she looked familiar and then when I walked by her up close, I said, “Are you Andrea?” and she’s like, “Yeah! Sheila?!” (that’s my sis), but yeah well we went like so excited to see each other again…I met her sister Chloe too and she’s pretty cool as well :). Shame that David didn’t come; apparently he had to work. I must be getting really old or something but I gotta sleep so early at retreats now. Maybe it’s because somehow I was notified last min that I was expected to attend the 7:30 AM prayer meetings (b/c I was supposedly on the CUAR committee due to handbook compilation), which meant that I had to wake up at 6:30 AM to shower (yes, I must shower :P). Or maybe it was b/c I was recovering from a cold as well. Ah wellz.
</p>



<p>
Stopped @ Hershey’s Factory on the way back, but once I walked in to see the Factory itself, it totally reminded me of the Canadian Mint, but it was chocolate instead of coins (and no smelly ppl :P). The sweetness of the smell almost sickened me. I didn’t buy too too much ($10.36) b/c I’m not too too into chocolate, but some ppl (*ahem* marcy *cough*) bought like $46 of candy! Actually, i don’t think I’ll be that excited again. Once I started to read the ingredients of those products, it started to totally turn me away from buying so much…
</p>



<p>
I wasn’t sure exactly what I learned at CUAR but when I took the time to reflect, it was a formula that Pastor Chris Lee (speaker) left with us:
</p>



<p align="center">
Spiritual Growth=(Willingness to Learn) * (Willingness to Change)
</p>



<p>
I realise that often I’m really willing to learn, but not exactly willing to change much. I tend to be quite complacent or stubborn in terms of liking to stay put and being in control (ie. changes or uncertainties w my future, etc. often give me insecurities), which might explain why I haven’t matured much w/in the last year. Pastor Chris explained that even if one factor is only 1% and say the other is say 10%, you’ll still get 10% of growth, but if one factor is lacking (0), 10*0 is still 0, so you’ll experience no effects in your spiritual walk with God. Makes perfect sense now that I see the analogy visually. I also need to be more passionate for Christ.
</p>



<p>
Addtionally, I was once again reminded of my commitment to reach out to the non-Christians around me wherever God placed me. I remember last term in my Prayer Duo (w Vonnekins), I had a notion that whether I was in Ottawa or in Toronto, I was responsible to reach out to certain individuals and live a living testimony of God’s love. I’m not entirely sure that I’ve done my part just yet…tho’ I pray that my lifestyle will reflect the joys of being a Christian :).
</p>



<p>
Another thought that occured to me was the word “Retreat” itself. The word reminded me that the weekend is supposed to be a “Retreat from the distractions of everyday life, and a retreat unto God”…
</p>



<p>
I also felt this spiritual battle throughout the retreat. I can’t believe I was victim in falling for my “fleshy” desires…of snoozing. Although I prolly had a TON of zzz compared to many others, I had to fight so hard to keep awake. The first day I blamed it on Dimetapp (which may or may not have been the cause), so I didn’t take it the second day. The times that I didn’t pray for power and strength, I sccumbed to the temptation. =(. Think twas thrice in total; one for PD’s workshop (whoops), maybe during a msg (in and out), and during the concert of prayer for A in ACTS (Adoration, Confession, Thanksgiving, Supplication). I was amazed at how much prayer helped me. After I realised what I was doing and I earnestly sought after God for help, I was fully and completely awake. Confirmed something else tho, I really really hate 2D speakers, namely TV evangelists. Even tho Ravi Zacharias was really good and kept most of my attn, I almost fell asleep b/c I just can’t pay attn to someone who’s giving me fake eye contact. I like radio cassette sermons from him and his books tho. Same w Henry Blackaby (dats the workshop I fell asleep in). In fact, for the Fresh Encounter workshop, I want to avoid all SS sessions w videos in them from now on b/c of this dislike/restlessness for sermon videos. Kinda like RC Sproul I guess.
</p>



<p>
Back to the city: my interview today got cancelled but for some reason I never got the voicemail message that the guy seemed to have claimed to left in my voice-mailbox, so I ended up going to the place for no reason. Tho’ I’m not sure if it was really no reason b/c now at least I have a better idea of the atmosphere. I also met this really friendly Chinese girl named Irene at the office. One of my first thoughts were, “WOW! she’s so friendly and seems to emit this atmosphere of joy and that she enjoys her job, whatever it is (looks like mail-delivery girl, etc.)”… “maybe I will be able to get to know her if I get hired and introduce her to some of my friends at OCAC.” Then I evenutally find out that she DOES go to OCAC but in the Chinese side =). Think would be fun to get to know her. So it’s postponed til next Wed (tentatively b/c the interviewer might be in Montréal due to an opening of a new store), but I also have a gov’t job interview on Thurs., so I hope that will go well as well (even tho it’s min pay. *siiigh*–I’ve never been paid $6.85 in my entire life before as min pay in Vanc when I started working was $7 or $7.50). I’ll pray that I get one of them!</p>

CUAR is in one day. I’m not entirely sure that I look forward to it as much anymore. The weekend forecast is rain (can one still canoe?!) and gloom. Much prayer needed for us…
</p>



<p>
How is it possible that I’ve done handbooks before (at least 3 or 4) and it was loads of fun (and time consuming, yes), but this one is just crazy? I suppose it’s because I was given plenty of time instead of only 24 hrs or less to work on it! And to think that I wanted to “graphic-ize” it too :P. *sigh*. I can’t believe this handbook spoilt my plans today. I guess the Aviation Museum will haveta wait ’til next Thursday, when it’s free. And to think that I was soooo looking forward to my highlight of the week. What a big disappointment. I’m not too happy with the outcome of the handbook either. It’s really not up-to-par in terms of quality, but hey, it’s a rush job.
</p>



<p>
<font color="#990033">Update @ 2:12 AM, May 17, 2002:</font> God’s timing and hand into this really helped, I think =). If we finished any earlier and gotten it printed elsewhere, I dunno how much it’d cost, but somehow, tonight at Staple’s Copy Centre, 58 stapled and folded booklets ended up to be only $37.35 (tax included). The strangest thing is that the quoted price was $0.07 per page (0-99 copies) and $0.25 per booklet to fold and staple. Now if one book has 7 pages double sided, that would be 14 pages…14*0.07+25=$1.23…multiply that by 58…=$71.34 w/o tax. Is my math just bad or am I just really tired? Well in any case, it was quite an adventure. Since they required 2 hrs, we didn’t know what to do so late in the night, so we just went to Hunt Club’s Tim Hortons and then McD’s. I don’t think I want to go to Hunt Club’s T.H. again b/c last time they screwed up my Café Mocha, and this time, even tho it wasn’t as diluted, they forgot the chocolate sprinkles! =(.
<br><font color="#990033">-End of Update-</font>
</p>



<p>
On another note: I have an interview on Tuesday! Wow, I don’t think I’ve had an official face-to-face interview (always casual or via phone) for about 2 years now. I’m kinda scared. =| Please pray 🙂 I gotta find time to prepare for it too and with the retreat comin’ up tomolo…
</p>



<p>
On toothpaste: Woah COOOL! My cos’ uses this toothpaste (Colgate Total w Whitening) that is “anti-bacterial”. Never used such a thing before (b/c it’s too expensive for a student’s taste :P). it “tastes” pretty minty too :). (the nice thing about room and board is that my toothpaste gets paid for too. heheh :P).</p>

		<p>				exact day(s). The symptoms were similar and everything! First itchy throat, then cough, then sniffles and runny nose (and urges to sneeze now). Some have suggested that it’s allergies. Ah non! I can’t possibly be developing allergies at this age and with such progessive symptoms?!


</p><p>
Went to the library again today. All the books I wanted were <i>still</i> signed out so I borrowed two books from Francine Rivers that I haven’t read yet. I hope they’re good, but she usually writes well (Christian fiction for mostly women readers).
</p>



<p>
Spent evening @ Marc’s playing Chinese Checkers (the “true” way), and Scrabble to which I ended up frustrating him with my combination and placement of letters to form words.
</p>



<p>
The sermons today were both really good. Rev. Joseph Lee came to speak to the English side and surprisingly, I can’t remember what he talked about…cept for the vague retellings of testimonies of the church in Guatemala. The one I remembered most was Auntie Helen’s (Lee’s wife) sermon. She preached on reconciliation and living a Christian testimony w/o words (ie. lifestyle evangelism) to the Chinese congregation. One reason I remembered it was because many of her anecdotes I could identify with, and she impressed upon me that her family is really tight, respects, and loves each other. Another reason why I was so eager to hear Auntie Helen speak is because I know that my mom knows her and because she’s my youth pastor’s (from BAC) real auntie (she kinda looks like Auntie Helen in some ways). Actually, my mom just told me that they useta be in the same choir together back before my mom was married at VCAC (’70s?). The last reason is because I know she’s a very dynamic speaker. If at least 3 or more people at KW blogged about what Auntie Helen’s sermon was about last week at KWCAC, I knew that she was worth hearing, even if it was IN Cantonese. I somewhat expected a sermon on reconciliation since she talked about it at JMC as well this year, and at KW last week, but it never REALLY occured to me until I read the English translation of 2 Corinthians 5:17-20. I had no idea what “wor ho” was until past mid-way of the sermon…when all of a sudden it dawned on me that it meant “reconcile”!
</p>



<p>
Tho’ I would’ve prolly never checked out the Chinese side of OCAC if it wasn’t for Auntie Helen. I kinda felt that I stood out, kept lookin’ around to see if I stuck out like a sore thumb or not and if ppl noticed that I wasn’t quite as Chinese as they were. Not only does an organ bug me in a non-Cathedral/wedding setting, the hymns they sang I didn’t know. Both BAC and KWCAC have slowly transitioned towards singing the newer Chinese contemporary praise and worship songs now, which I prefer a lot more. :). So, if anyone really paid much attention, for all the words that were new (tho not too too many which I’m thankful of :P), I just kinda stopped singing :D. The really really odd thing was that this lady (OCAC member I believe) beside me (her name escapes me), thought that my name was Grace and said that she hasn’t seen me in service for a very long time now. I told her my name and that I’ve only arrived for a month. I guess it’s encouraging that some people notice who’s new and all..:P Tho’ I wonder who Grace is…
</p>



<p>
Note: <i>Whipped</i> is not worth watching. Can’t see the humour. Perhaps I’m not a guy, but hey, after watching this, I’m glad I’m not. Sadly enough, this movie reminds me of some people I know. Slot it in same category as AP (<i>Austin Powers, American Pie</i>) and <i>There’s Something About Mary</i>.</p>

		<p>				 I’ve settled in
          my new place! it’s brand-new and I have my own room and it’s only $400
          room and board (ie. food and cooking included :P). Think DD would like
          that ;D. The utils include cable and A/C. And although I was rather
          intimidated by my own cousin at first –from my previous encounters
          with him when we were all younger (that’s who I’m staying with: him
          and his wife), it’s actually quite fun :). This is what the place looks
          like (similarly) from the outside:</p>


        

<p>It’s
          a rather quick 5 min sketch of the place, but the units are similar
          to what I see from my window. Theirs would be similiar to the left-most
          one. So there’s 4 units to one building.</p>


        

<p>Since
          the move, I’ve been pretty much bored. Since going to the library I
          finished 3 H.P books already, and <i>The Poisonwood Bible</i>. Now that
          i’ve read the books, I think the movie is more interesting to watch,
          tho a tad bit long. Back when HP was overly-hyped, there was a controversy
          (and still is, though not as much) about the very nature of the books
          in the Christian circle. I see the bad (highly influential w theme/nature
          of books), and I see the good (friendships, good vs evil) in the books.
          But if JK Rowling gets much criticism for what she writes, why didn’t
          other children’s lit authors such as RL Stine (eg. <i>Goosebumps</i>),
          Christopher Pike, Bruce Coville (eg. <i>Jeremy Thatcher, Dragon Hatcher</i>)
          , Ruth Chew (eg. <i>Second-hand Magic</i>), and even Roald Dahl, get
          equally criticised? Even Dahl’s <i>Matilda</i> was made into a movie
          and she had special powers. These (cept Pike and Stine–that was more
          high school) were some my favourite children authors. Any books that
          had to do with ghosts and the supernatural, mystery, and suspense I’d
          be captivated. I didn’t see anyone warning me about the dangerous powers.
          However, I see a point in warning a child with a wild imagination, such
          as mine, to be careful about what one reads as books influence ones
          thinking quite easily as well and to keep an open eye before reading
          and discussing with a parent or somethng after is prolly always better.
          Related thought: CS Lewis’ <i>The Chronicles of Narnia</i> also has
          good and bad witches within Narnia–keeping in mind that his books are
          of Christian allegory, how much difference does that make?</p>


        

<p>Onto
          Barbara Kingsolver’s <i>The Poisonwood Bible</i>, I figured out why
          SilQ doesn’t like and why it’s an Oprah book choice. I read <i>Paradise
          Lost</i> by Toni Morrison for Women’s Lit one year and that was also
          an Oprah pick. I didn’t like it after reading it. Both books are women-oriented–how
          the women are oppressed in all sorts of ways (in spirit, emotionally,
          etc.) and how each woman manage to escape and change (or not) at the
          end. The plot of <i>The Poisionwood Bible </i>moves quite slowly but
          by the end of the book, you see how each character develops or remains
          the same. Tho’ this book kinda gives a negative impression of missionary
          families. The father is somewhat a hypocrite and is more concerned about
          preaching the words of the Bible than living his life reflective of
          the Bible. I hope there are less missionary fathers like that out there
          though the adjusting to a new place for the MKs, etc. seems very realistic.</p>


        

<p>Tonight,
          celebrated Mother’s Day early w the Wong’s @ Brother Wu’s and headed
          over to Marc’s place to play a game of Chinese Checkers w him, Keith
          and eventually, his dad. However, I was so frustrated at the end b/c
          Marcy wouldn’t budge his marble from my property (triangle) so I lost
          1st place to him. Another thing, i’m so useta playing with allowance
          in jumping over 1 marble if there are equal number of empty holes on
          both sides of the marble instead of just a frog leap over…totally
          forgot that some ppl here don’t know that one can do that and so they
          forbade me! Slows the game down sooo much. Ah wellz 😛
</p>



<p>
11:30 PM FIIIIRE! Oh man, I missed a great view of a burning house today. I’ve never seen a fire up close before but Marc refused to drive near it so that I could see what’s goin’ on but I imagine it’d be all over the news tomorrow since it took at least 30 hr and more than 6 firetrucks to put out. The flames were so high that I could see it outside my window as they reached over the roofs of the new townhouses that blocked my view. Actually, the burning house(s) were only 1 lot down from us. The smoke was somethin’ else. At times it was clear and foggy, but other times, you could see it black against the already black sky. At one point, it occured to me that if the firefighters did not have it under control, we’d soon be next so I decided to pray fer the fighters :)…</p>

<p> On movies. Saw Amélie on my HD the other day. Was an interesting movie
          in the sense that it seemed to be a low-budget, Ally McBealish film
          and very very artsy. Not really my type of film. And no, in case you
          were wondering my nickname isn’t a spin-off from that movie. Some CCFers
          (now graduated) gave it to me way back in my first year.</p>

		<p>				 Went to library to sign out three more books (Woohoo, I’m on a reading
          roll. Time for the bookworm to come out from hibernation!). 2 Harry
          Potters and <i>The Poisonwood Bible</i>. I’m still waiting for LaHaye/Jenkin’s
          <i>Desecration</i> and <i>The Jade Peony</i>–does anyone know what’s
          the second (or first?) book by Wayson Choy is called?
        </p>



<p> Still looking for a job. Lady from environment Canada called me on
          Sunday–there’s still hope for me in Toronto. Yesterday went to an optical
          to see the optometrist there because he might be able to get me a communications
          related job in the head office. I didn’t have a good experience tho
          with the owner(s). I walked in and the lady asked if she could help
          me and I politely asked for the optometrist. However, he was on break
          so during the time I waited (uncomfortably mind you), she interrogated
          me with all these questions and who sent me here, after learning that
          I was not here to take an eye exam. After doing so, she goes “inside”
          her office, switches to Cantonese and talks to her husband. I loudly
          hear her state that Chris sent me there to apply for a job and loudly
          says to her husband that they’re not hiring and wonders what Chris had
          done. Think her husband suggested that it was perhaps the HQ that was
          hiring. Shortly after, her husband comes out and says, “so Chris sent
          you here?” and I said “yes, my friend Chris did.” He replies, “Chris?
          Chris Tang?” to which I respond with, “Yes. Chris Tan.” (man, are you
          guys deaf? how many times do I haveta say that Chris asked me to come?)
          By this point, I was like, uh-oh, is Chris gonna be in trouble? So,
          I made a get-away and called Chris to kinda warn him of the situation
          b/c I didn’t want to get Chris into trouble and by the sounds of things,
          that’s exactly what it sounded like. Thankfully Chris got everything
          sorted out with them. Phew.

		<p>				 Wednesday was quite um adventurous. Firstly, my utmost apologies to
          Danny and Chris for making them late for prayer meeting. And much thanks
          for them in helping my cousin(s) move into their new place. Wow, that
          place is sure nice! I’m looking fwd to live there tomolo :). After the
          move, Marcy and I got dropped off at St. Laurie’s because Marcy had
          to go home to do some project work (*groan*) so he couldn’t make it
          to prayer meeting. We stopped to grab a hearty meal (well not really,
          but nevertheless…) and we dropped by Sunglass Hut to see how Jonnie
          was doin’. I ended up trying to persuade Marcy to come w me to SportCheck
          to see if those shoes were still available but I got distracted by this
          whole crowd of ppl standin’ front of <a href="http://www.baskinrobbins.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Baskin
          Robbins</a>. I wanted to see what the commotion was all about and saw
          this really cool banner that advertised for a free scoop of ice cream
          for each customer! YUMMY! (I totally forgot that each year on May 1st,
          BR gives out a <b>FREE</b> scoop of ice cream nationwide). I got a sherbet
          and Mumbles ended up w a sugar cone (*envy!*). After, Jon convinced
          me to eat s’more by persuadin’ us to go w him to East Sides, so basically
          I ate non-stop … b/c I couldn’t resist the food and so ordered a bruschetta.
          mmmmm…nummy! Don’t think I’ve had 3 meals w/in such a short time frame.
          Tho, it was more like appetizer, entrée and dessert in the wrong order.
        </p>



<p> Thursday was yesterday. After buying those shoes (alone b/c Mumbles
          wasn’t about to go w me but that served to be betta b/c I was able to
          buy other things I needed as well), I bused home. Later, as Marcy went
          to another place for his “project” meeting, I met up w SilQ, Jonnie-boy,
          and JJ at St. Lauries. Ended up going to Ottawa U to check out job postings
          but there were none applicable. We made fun of each other all day, which
          strangely made me warmer as I walked in the cold. Because the boyz were
          hungry, we stopped at Dunn’s for some grub. Tho’ SilQ <i>almost</i>
          got lost on his way to Scotiabank. We went all the way to Elgin Street
          and Frank (Elgin St. Diner) before finding it. I didn’t want to spend
          anymore unncessary $ on grub so I just kinda watched them eat this yummy
          smoked meat poutine (tho Jonnie had 2 weiners :P) and drank my grapefruit
          juice. Went to Rideau Centre afer and they scrounged around for Mumbles
          belated bday present and kinda killed time. Somehow, we ended up in
          Chapters and I ended up in the Bargain Books section and I managed to
          find a Asian cookbook encyclopedia that I liked. It’s rare that I buy
          any books, much less cookbooks! I flipped through the book and noticed
          that most of the receipes seemed quite authentic w readily-available
          ingredients. Has tons of coloured pix of “cutting” and various cookin’
          techniques, as well w look-alikes of what seems “Chinese” as well as
          other Asian dishes, and an index (helps me when I have ingredients but
          dunno what to make). Even teaches you how to cook rice. HAHA. At first
          I wasn’t gonna even take a glance at it b/c of an “white” last name
          of the contributing editor, but upon closer inspected, I read that it
          was printed and bound in China, specifically HK! Thankfully, SiLQ has
          a Chapters Club card so I got 10% off ;). So, as much as it was ($14.99),
          I hope to improve my cooking skills and expand my “menu” by the end
          of the summer (and I’ll invite y’all over and poison ya *muhahahah*):P.
          Speaking of food, had dinner at Joey’s Only Seafood in Merrivale to
          celebrate Mr. Geezer’s belated bday :). Tho’ I think Red Lobster or
          La Pointe serves better seafood. Tho’ this place is less expensive.
          On Tuesdays it’s $6.95 for all-you-can-eat fish and chips there, just
          like what we have over in BC. I had that once there in Abbotsford or
          Langley b/c my dad knew the owner of that particular restaurant.
        </p>



<p> Today, Marcy woke me up at 800 hrs and somehow persuaded me to go
          meet up w him at Carleton U so I could go look for some jobs at the
          employment centre. Guess what? That boy made me wait for him til like
          1 PM! At first was gonna meet me there but by the time I got there,
          he said he was comin’ at 10:30, so I decided to finish Amy Tan’s book
          <i>The Bonesetter’s Daughter</i> (thank God I decided to bring a book).
          I called him at around 11 am and he said he was comin’ and didn’t show
          til close to 1 when I finished my book (yes, I read fast but that book
          wasn’t that good. I still like <i>The Kitchen God’s Wife</i> the best)
          and took a nap. I was sooooo hungry and tired by the time he found me
          half awake at the library. There’s a reason why anything to do w his
          “project” isn’t all to positive in my books. I can’t believe Carleton’s
          library. They forbid cell phones and food and drinks! Wah, so restrictive!
          How would anyone contact me and what if I’m hungry? I bought this tea
          and doughnut at Timmy Ho’s figuring that I could snack while I read,
          but when I <b>finally</b> found my way to the library via the labrinyth
          of tunnels (no worries, I only made 1 wrong turn), I got there and to
          my utter dismay they didn’t let me have food! So, anyhow, I plopped
          down w my unopened tea at hand and my bag of doughnut on the table and
          shortly, this staff dude comes by and says that I can’t have food. I
          muttered something to the lines of, “yeah, I’m not gonna open this”,
          and he’s like, “well, just make sure you conceal it so not to encourage
          others to bring food in here”. Hmm, what a dandy idea. While I sat for
          about 3 hrs and as my tea got cold, my stomach began to rumble and so
          I carefully ended up eating my “concealed” entire honey cruller in the
          library bite by bite as I was sitting right next to the info desk.
        </p>



<p> Spent afternoon and evening at my aunt’s place again. Helped the kids
          in their Chinese tho’ I’m not entirely sure that I’ve helped them much
          or correctly for that matter. I hope it helped anyhow; tho it was fun
          :). I seemed to have picked up more in my understanding of French again.
          Think I might drop by again next week b/c Fabrice has an exam next week
          and we’re not sure if my uncle will be back or not by then. I’m amazed
          at what the kids already know tho’! The second oldest one is already
          in “Grade 7” and the oldest has moved onto Mandarin (Cdn standards;
          HK = Grade 2 or 3)– many of the words I can’t remember anymore–basically
          they’re at my reading level! = | Impressive! Since their mother tongue
          is prolly French. Camille is prolly the best at the pronounciation but
          I guess it’s b/c she’s the youngest (still retains and practices more
          Chinese @ home). Okay, more motivation for me to practice my reading
          skills this summer!
        </p>



<p> Moving day tomolo! Kinda excited, kinda hmm…mixture of different
          feelings…esp to a new place w new ppl…</p>

      BRR! it’s mighty cold here, what’s up w the weather? Can’t Mother Nature make up her mind? In the Winter, when it was actually supposed to be winter, it was quite warm (and I ain’t complaining there); but when it’s Spring, I expect it to reflect that instead of all this white stuff we see in -6C. Must be God’s sense of humour; man, he must be sheddin’ lots of dandruff lately! :P. Thus, concludes my first weekend here in Ottawa since the last summer term.
      </p>



<p>
      Because there was no program for fellowship on Saturday, a handful of us went to the Met for CityWide W&P. I felt like I haven’t been to church for a LOOONG time tho’ it was only 2 weeks ago. Thankfully, there was no couple making out/feelin’ each other up and down that evening to distract our pew of ppl. Nate told HowL to meet at 7 pm so thaz what HowL passed onto me. Thus, Marcy and I show up at the Met at 1900 hrs, and guess what? Nobody was there. The greeters said, “We start at 7:30, but you’re welcome to sit down”. I was thinking, “Great. If they all show at 7:30 pm, they will be 1/2 late.” I don’t like CST sometimes esp when it’s not working in my favour. Somehow in the middle of the program, it occured to me that Rice just might’ve liked it since he likes commenting on the praise section of worship. This time around, the worship team led (harmonizable! :P) songs from a variety of groups instead of only fron Hillsongs/Vineyard. Closing my eyes, I could almost imagine the sounds of heaven: it will be 100 and more times fuller than what it sounded like that night. Bumped into Andrew Fung, one of the Spice Girls in the CCF Lifesong in 98. Wow, I didn’t realise that he grew up at the Met.

      After, we headed to Elgin Street Diner on … Elgin Street! heheh. Marcy and I each had a slice of cheesecake and the rest of the table seemed to have breakfasts. They’re not too bad in terms of being low class because they have 2-ply toilet paper at least. Jeff was the “lap-sap toong” (garbage can) for the night because he cleared a plate of pancakes from Viv b/c she couldn’t finish it, and Matt’s leftovers as well–quite an amusing sight :P. <a href="http://community.webshots.com/photo/29478169/36642512JEtkcJ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gravy</a> sauntered in midway and we ended up celebrating his bday at midnight there with an apple pie :)–so he’s an old geezer now; 24 years old!
      </p>



<p>
      Sunday service at OCAC was aite. Guest Speaker from some church in TO (ManJon Wong?) spoke on his upcming trip to Amsterdam. SS was okay though I don’t have a high tolerance for video lecturers; reminds me of TV evangelists, and RC Sproul–they put me to sleep and I get really restless. I don’t know what to do this term, there doesn’t seem to be a good variety of classes to choose from. Maybe I’ll got to C.L.A.S.S. 201 since I have yet to attend that one (been to BAC’s 101, OCAC’s 301 and some of 401).
      </p>



<p>
      After SS, I quickly left to make it for my cousin’s first communion. Très bizarre! We went to St. Marie’s on Innes Road and it was a pure 100% French-speaking Catholic church. Firstly, I have never been to a mass or a service at a RC church, and secondly, I cannot understand French. Thus, I was not familiar in anything. I walk in and I think the only two Chinese ppl there were me and my uncle. I look around and it looks soooo contemporary. The ceilings are like gymnasiums and the colours are vibrant. There is no organ and the choir is comprised of vocalists and instruments: drums (snare mostly), flute, guitars(?). I didn’t know any of the “hymns” they sang, which were unsurprisingly easy to learn. Not that many in the congregation were singing. One of them was to the tune of “Michael, row your bow ashore, Hallelujah” and I was bewildered to hear them play a children’s song; I never got the meaning of that song, even as a child. The verse on the wall paraphrased Matthew 5:13-14 in French quite well: You are the salt of the earth; You are the light of the world. The 2 phrases look and sound very artistic for some reason in French.
      </p>



<p>
      The priest/Father was not as boring as I preconceived him to be. He was quite lively and used Q&A to get the congregation to interact with them. It’s rare that a preacher steps down from the pulpit and walk through the aisles: reminds me of <i>Keeping the Faith</i> somehow. Did I understand him? Hmm, not really. I think I only recognised John 14:1-4. And then there was communion. Everyone lined up to get the bread and the optional “cup”. Once it was your turn, you’d cupping your hand out as if you’re beggin’ and after hearing the usher say, “God’s grace” or something along those lines (that was surprisingly in English or maybe I just heard wrong), you’d say “Amen” and take the bread. The person would then take the bread and dip it in the cup or drink from the cup. Gross, sharing germs! My cousins just took it and ate it like a cracker for fun of it. I don’t think they know the meaning of the bread and cup. At first, I wanted to opt out, but then figured that since I’ve taken communion before … At the very end of the service, the Father explained the whole cross motion thing but because it was in French, I didn’t catch much of it. Maybe Rice can explain it to me one day.
      </p>



<p>
      Spent dinner over at my aunt’s and some time w my cousins; did some beading craft w Camille. My aunt cooked up a really great Middle Eastern meal once again :). My uncle flew to the States for a month so she’s got a handful of kids to look after! I will head over to their place again on Friday to tutor Max in Chinese coz he’s got an Chinese-school exam on Saturday. I think it’s in Mandarin. Hehe, that should be fun! 🙂</p>
