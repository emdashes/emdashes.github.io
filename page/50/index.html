		<p>				“Here I am. Send me.” 
  

</p><p>Context: Excerpt of my application for a missions project in British Columbia.
    <br>
    Update: I got accepted to the project but not for the job position, thus I
    rejected their acceptance.</p>


  

<p><i>“29. Explain your reasons for wanting to be a part of this project.
    Include specific goals and objectives.” </i></p>


  

<p>To be honest with you, I had no intention of applying for any missions project
    this year. Even after a couple of people from my home fellowship decided to
    apply for the OEX project, which I was slightly interested in a few years
    back, I did not give missions a second-thought. However, a couple weeks ago,
    the e-mailer for CC at our campus sent out an e-mail announcing its new website.
    Out of curiosity, I clicked on the link and eventually somehow ended up at
    the Project website. I ended up reading through the descriptions for all of
    the Projects and sent an ICQ message to my sister telling her that she should
    consider the TO or Vancouver Projects since she was looking for a job and
    also because I know she likes ministry related events. A day passed and all
    of a sudden, something piqued my interest in reconsidering what I passed along
    to my sister. I decided pray and ICQed a few people that I trusted, including
    a friend who went on the Sonrise Project last year, a couple of pastors, and
    my parents and asked their opinions about applying to go on short-term missions.
    Admittedly, I had selfish motives for wanting to go on this Project in Vancouver.
    My first reason was because the job offers seemed to be so relevant to what
    I wanted to do in my future career. Secondly, I wanted to work near my home,
    and lastly, because of my positive experience at the HQ in 1998, I had always
    wanted to work for Campus Crusade again. </p>


  

<p>The second reason soon fizzled as I learned that I would have little to no
    free time to visit my friends at home or stay with my family as the Project
    would occupy a participant’s time almost 24/7. I would also be giving
    up 4 months to spend time away from my closest friends in Ontario. I was discouraged,
    but many people were already praying for me. A couple of years ago, when I
    spoke to my parents about OEX, they were quite against the idea of me traveling
    to a “foreign” country and doing missions, but this time surprisingly
    enough, my parents even encouraged me to apply! Well, I was reluctant but
    began to pray about applying. During reading week, I kept putting it off using
    the excuse that my credit card was upstairs and so I was lazy to submit my
    application. However, during my last weekend in Ottawa, I was bombarded with
    reminders by God. I can only say that they were by God as only He knew what
    I was struggling with-stepping out of my comfort zone and having courage to
    obey. </p>


  

<p>What was there to obey? Throughout the weekend, each program I attended focused
    on evangelism. On Saturday night, our fellowship had a workshop focusing on
    evangelism. During service on Sunday, the pastor switched from talking about
    hell (the past couple of weeks) to why Christians should evangelize, with
    special focus on peer/relational evangelism. The sermon and response song
    were entitled, “People need the Lord”. The worship songs reflected
    the need to tell and change the world including one inspired from Isaiah 6:8
    which says, “Here am I. Send me!” Throughout the service, I kept
    questioning myself, “Am I willing?” By the end of it, I confided
    in my closest friend and told him that I might not be returning to Ottawa
    in the summer. Class 401 (a series of “classes” based on ideas from
    a church in the States) continued to illustrate the various methods of evangelism
    and how to detect smokescreens (or answering objections). With a burden in
    my heart, upon returning home, I immediately took my wallet downstairs and
    submitted my application fee. </p>


  

<p>Although God may not want to send me this year to Vancouver for missions,
    I do know that, like my first year in university, I need to step out of my
    comfort zone again. Whether through missions or not, I have the responsibility
    to bring the Good News to my friends and peers. By applying to this Project,
    I have already taken a step of faith and left the rest to God. God willing,
    although I will sadly depart from my dear friends in Ontario in May, I will
    have something exciting and rewarding to look forward to: 4 months to stretch
    me spiritually, taking me out of my comfort zone, and perhaps even being able
    to reach my lifetime goal of personally leading a person to Christ. I know
    that the people I have shared my experience with are also praying for and
    with me. I, too, continue to pray. </p>

</p><p align="left"><i>“Trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not

  </p>


  

<p align="left">I had memorized Proverbs 3:5-6 (NIV) as a youth, but I had no
    idea how it would apply to me. Actually, I didn’t even know what the verse
    meant. It was just a “good” verse to remember because everyone else
    knew it and I’m sure I got something in return for memorizing it: a sticker,
    a bookmark, etc. Now, I can thank God for showing me what it means, through
    life experience! </p>


  

<p>Second year at the University of Waterloo. Looking back, I can say that it
    seemed more stable than first year, but it was just as much work in terms
    of academics, if not more. Adjusting to university life, especially when you’re
    away from home, took a year for me. I learned from the mistakes I made as
    a frosh. I learned that cramming doesn’t work as well as it did in high school,
    that sleep is essential if you want to put effort into studying in the afternoons
    (instead of napping to make up for the time lost at night) and also to be
    able to wake up for church and not fall asleep during sermons, that skipping
    class really doesn’t do you any good–unless you know what you are doing,
    and that your own cooking is three times as good as campus food–even if you
    don’t know how to cook! </p>


  

<p>Fall 1999: a term of confusion, and decisions. The fall term began as a fresh,
    new start. I settled into an apartment, which I shared with a fellow CCFer
    and began the habit of studying in the DC, then DP–the quiet, non-CCF library.
    I’m glad that I didn’t have resnet; I only had limited hours and a slow connection
    speed. Yet, the computer and my inviting bed always tempted me, so that is
    why I relocated. Thank God that my place is so much closer (and warmer because
    most of the journey is indoors) than if I had to walk from residence. Despite
    my efforts to retain and understand what the professors tried to ‘teach’ me,
    I was still in a big mess, especially with organic chemistry. Oh boy. “Oh
    boy”, is the very least of it–just ask other people who have taken it.
    Either you naturally get it, or you don’t. Nothing in-between. It was then
    that I truly questionned where I was going next. </p>


  

<p>My housemate constantly heard me sighing I’m sure, constantly wondering whether
    I was in the right program. I started doubting myself, and tried to obtain
    people’s opinions around me. Some confidentally told me that I was at UW for
    one reason: to become an optometrist. If God opened that door for me in high
    school, then I should keep aiming for my goal. My good friend also encouraged
    me to stay in the program so that we could aim for our dreams together. I
    really admire her. She doesn’t give up, even though she may not be excelling
    in her courses either. She also has a plan B that is related to her field
    of study, but she continues to work hard to reach for plan A. </p>


  

<p align="center"><i>“Trust in the Lord with all your heart . . .”</i></p>


  

<p align="left">Towards the end of the term, I was pulled into two directions.
    I started thinking of a possible future in English (yipes, the faculty of
    arts! =\). But with a pursuit in arts, my parents had previously told me that
    I would have to go to SFU instead, which I didn’t want. I decided to wait
    for my marks to see whether I was able to pull up my science GPA. Admist this,
    I was praying. Harder than ever. </p>


  

<p>Winter 2000: This is where Proverbs 3:5-6 comes in. At Waterloo, the school
    term begins before marks are released from the previous term. I was still
    registered in the pre-optometry program and began another term with my science
    courses, and urgh, organic chemistry. Two weeks in, I decided to back out
    of that course and decided to take an arts course for fun (I barely passed
    the first organic chemistry, and I wasn’t about to fail another course). I
    think I was only taking 3 sciences like the previous term. </p>


  

<p align="center"><i>“. . .and lean not on your own understanding; . .
    .” </i></p>


  

<p>After bouncing the idea of going into RPW off my parents, they didn’t persist
    on insisting me to transfer to SFU. I was pleasantly surprised. One day, I
    decided to see the arts advisor to ask for er, advice? Actually, I don’t even
    remember how I ended up in his office. At that point, I think I (had already?)
    found out that my previous term marks weren’t all that great in the sciences.
    However, I did quite well in the 2 arts courses I took (‘A’ range). He told
    me that if I was to switch into English, I would be able to do so without
    any problems, and best of all, every credit to date will be able to be transferred
    (normally students start off with a clean slate), so I would be going into
    arts as a third-year student with a high average in arts. On top of that,
    I had already met the requirements and pre-requisites in getting into my program
    without having to take extra time to make-up for any missing credits. Throughout
    the first and part of my second year, I had taken arts courses merely as electives,
    some of which were “recommended” as part of the pre-optometry program;
    others were merely taken out of interest sake. Additionally, in the faculty
    of arts, one is must fulfill two groups of requirements on top of your program
    requirements; upon the completion of the winter term, I would have already
    fulfilled more than half! </p>


  

<p>I decided to change all my courses (except human physiology) to art courses.
    Funny that I decided to see the advisor on that particular day, for it was
    the last day to make changes–I wasn’t even aware of that! The science advisor
    finalized it by signing the form. I decided to forget about studying for the
    OAT (the optometry admission test) and just write it (because it was unrefundable).
    Turns out, I achieved average in my overall sciences and a little less for
    overall average. Oh well, I didn’t study for it. I viewed my winter term as
    a term of transition. If I did very well in my one science course and only
    fair in my arts courses, then I would reconsider continuing my pursuit in
    the sciences. </p>


  

<p align="center"><i>” . . .in all your ways, acknowledge him . . .”
    </i></p>


  

<p>Throughout the term, I was constantly praying and seeking answers. Yet, even
    then, what happened on the day when I saw the advisor was more than a coincidence.
    I don’t believe in coincidences or luck for that matter. Additional to prayer,
    I needed to do my part in doing my best and trying my hardest, which meant
    I needed to keep up with my courses = studying. Before I knew it, midterms
    came around yet, the results didn’t discourage me. Instead, I kept working
    to improve with the hopes that I would pull up my GPA by the end of the term,
    and that I would exit the my current program with dignity (ie. taken off of
    conditional standing). The final part of the term came and went. Final examinations
    were written, and I impatiently waited in anticipation for the results to
    see how well (or poorly as usual) I did. I had to wait for 1 month! Such a
    slow system; at UBC/SFU, students can find out their marks almost right away
    through telereg (or something similar to that using a touch-tone phone). </p>


  

<p>Alas, my marks came back after everyone else got theirs! I was very happy
    to see that the human physiology course was my best science course thus far,
    but compared with the rest of my arts courses, it was still the worst of them
    all. Maybe my strength has been in arts all along? The marks are encouraging
    to say the least. I am off conditional standing and I could continue with
    pre-optometry. </p>


  

<p>Another incident caused me to discredit concidences and luck, and to thank
    God instead. When I tried to pre-register in for the pre-optometry program
    (as the acceptance decision was not made yet) for the fall term, the same
    advisor would not allow me to register for all arts courses and 1 science.
    First, she looked at my pre-registration form and asked why I wanted to take
    so many arts courses, and I said that I was planning to switch into arts.
    She looked at me in disbelief and asked, “Are you still in good standing?”
    Probably thinking that I wasn’t, I replied, “Yes.” She was shocked.
    Her face told it all. I could picture her thinking, “What’s that crazy
    girl doing? She’s in good standing, and yet she’s switching from such a prestigous
    program into the faculty of arts? The faculty where ‘everyone’ looks down
    upon?” But afterall that, she told me that even if I wanted to, I wouldn’t
    be able to take all arts, and 1 science because 2 sciences are mandatory to
    remain in the program. I was very surprised, because I suddenly realized that
    she made a mistake when she signed my course changes form at the beginning
    of the term for I only had 1 science. I was disappointed, but I filled out
    a ‘dummy’ form with all sciences (she even made me take a lab with a course,
    but my friend didn’t have to when she registered). I think the advisors there
    are a l’il mixed-up. </p>


  

<p align="center"><i>“. . .and he will make your paths straight.”
    </i></p>


  

<p>About making this path straight. Well, it’s not like I know for certain where
    God is leading me. However, at this point, I’ve been accepted into RPW at
    UW, and the past circumstances, including my marks, seem to have paved a direction
    for me. I do know that if I continue to trust Him, in hindsight, I will definitely
    see the how the ‘path’ became ‘straight.’ I cannot tell you that this choice
    to pursue a degree in English is the path that I will continue to follow.
    However, I trust that with each closed door, there is an open one with a window
    of opportunity inside. </p>

		<p>				Where are You, Lord?
  

</p><p>Where am I in life? Here I am. The mid-point of existence–uncertain, unknowing,
    and wavering in my thoughts of life. Is this what university does to a person?
    Yes indeed, I am a student. ‘Frosh’ as they term it here in Ontario
    –one that is fresh to university life. The exhilaration of it all: the freedom
    of living apart from parental guidance, the friends you make, the fun you
    have (and the not-so-fun aspect: studying and exams) . . . eight months goes
    by just so quickly! And yet towards the end of my first year, an unsettling
    aurora hangs in mid-air. Why? </p>


  

<p>I wish I could proudly stand up and say that my life is as smooth as a sailboat
    sailing in the summer breeze. Without trials and challenges in my life however,
    I would be less dependent on God and more dependent on myself. Questions range
    from academics to petty issues in my life. On many occasions, God in His provision
    has answered my prayer requests. Relatively speaking however, they seem minor
    compared to the issues that I am currently facing. Especially knowing what
    God’s will is for my life. </p>


  

<p>I have asked this question before in my last year in high school, as I was
    uncertain whether I had the marks to get into Pre-Optometry at the University
    of Waterloo. You see, I had wanted to get into Optometry ever since I had
    my eye vision first checked in Grade 9 but I was not sure whether God wanted
    me to be there or not. At one point in Grade 12, I almost decided to quit,
    giving up on Physics 12, but by a miracle of God, I pulled through and the
    provincial examination marks surprised me. I did not think I had done well
    at all (as with my Chemistry 12 examination as well). Thus, I was accepted
    into Pre-Optometry. At that time, I felt that since I was in Pre-Optometry,
    then becoming an optometrist was also God’s will! I was also determined
    to prove the pastor in Waterloo wrong as he had confidently said that I would
    never get into Optometry many years back. </p>


  

<p>Now, I look back at my wrong assumptions. I do think I misled myself. What
    was God’s purpose originally for me? Did He place me in a new environment
    away from home, so that I can learn to be dependent only on Him? Because I
    seem to have refocused my priorities, my academic marks do not seem as important
    to me, yet I know they are the most important if I want to remain in my program.
    If I continue with the grades I have (to the point where I am unsure whether
    I pass or fail my genetics course), I will be removed from my program, by
    the university. It seems that I fare better in the faculty of Arts, as Psychology
    and English keep me interested and my marks seem to be higher in those areas.
    Yet, school seems secondary to me now that I have so many opportunities to
    tell others of Christ. I keep asking God: if Optometry really is not for me,
    then what is? </p>


  

<p>The future still lies ever so murky, but the haze of fog slowly lifts as
    each closed door from God leads to a new opportunity. However, fear stands
    in the way. Fear of failure and disappointment (not that I have not been disappointed
    many times already), fear of what will happen to me. Sometimes, passive thoughts
    of death run through my head: ‘Wish a car would run me over, then I would
    not have to face tomorrow,’ but I know that thinking those thoughts do
    not get me anywhere. Maybe just more depressed. During those times, verses
    such as John 14:1 or Matthew 6:25-34, do not help me refrain from wondering,
    or being depressed over my situation. </p>


  

<p>I should be rejoicing that I will be home in less than a week but ironically,
    I do not want to go back anymore. After settling in Waterloo, I have grown
    accustomed to the freedom I have. From past experience, once I return home,
    I will again be under ‘house arrest’ (meaning bare minimum freedom)
    and choices, such as attending which church I want to serve at, will be taken
    away from me. Not only so, I will not be seeing some of my friends for awhile.
    Many are graduating this term, my cell group leader is graduating from his
    master’s program after the summer term is over, and my friend (also in
    my cell group) may not be here until her graduating term (Winter 2000) due
    to her co-op program. All these people that touched my lives, I’ll be
    leaving behind. The ones I felt were encouraging role models in many different
    ways, the ones that shared the vision of the campus fellowship and studied
    various biblical truths with me, and the very same ones that accepted me for
    who I am even though I was merely a frosh. Now with all this, how can I leave
    Waterloo permanently before my studies are over? That is what my parents are
    strongly suggesting I do if I do not remain in my current program as it is
    less costly to study in British Columbia. Which means, the pressure on my
    academic marks is doubled: to stay in program and to be able to stay at the
    University Waterloo. </p>


  

<p>Powerless. A feeling that arises when I cannot take control of the situation
    I am in; the only way to rid it is to leave everything up to God. Sometimes,
    I do wonder if the reason I struggle so much is because the freedom I have
    is destroying me. I lack discipline, motivation and because of this, I tend
    to enjoy procrastinating in the sin of laziness. God knows this as much as
    I do; yet I have such a hard time concentrating on my schoolwork. When it
    comes to being powerless of what is happening around me in regards to the
    Chinese Christian Fellowship (CCF) I am somewhat involved in, I feel even
    more helpless and hopeless. With conflicts in CCF that I cannot clearly discern
    as being spiritual at this time or not, I am easily frustrated and drained
    because no one is doing anything about the problems. It seems to be that what
    they say is merely all words, no actions. Training seems to be an area CCF
    seems to lack, and according to Campus Crusade for Christ, prayer, evangelism,
    and training (PET) are three of the most important elements a Christian ministry
    should have. I have been asked to join committee but I have declined many
    times, the ‘feeling’ like I am supposed to is just not there. Campus
    Crusade for Christ would rebut that feelings and emotions will waver and one
    cannot be dependent on them. Sometimes I wonder though, was that a wrong decision?
    I justify myself by saying my marks are not steady nor stable, my parents
    are against the idea, and definitely I do not see myself as qualified to serve
    as there are so many more mature and older people that are most likely more
    experienced. If these seem like feeble excuses even to me, what about to God?
  </p>


  

<p>These, amongst many other things in my life trouble me. Do not get me wrong,
    ironically, I am generally content with life. There is not almost a single
    day where I do not forget to thank the Lord for the sunshine He has provided
    (as compared to Vancouver), nor the freedom and experiences that I get to
    enjoy while I am here. No, I do not take life as a student for granted. However,
    the question that still concerns me the most is ‘What is God’s will
    for me, for my life?’ It seems to be an endless search for the answer
    to that question but I trust that someday in due time, God will reveal the
    answer to me just as long as I keep trusting Him. Where are you, Lord? </p>

		<p>				On
    Gap Inc. Retail Stores

    Note: These three websites are from the same company, <a href="http://www.gapinc.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://www.gapinc.com</a>.</p>




<p align="left"><b>Browser Compatibility </b><br>(this is an addition to the original
    critique, which was written in December 2001)</p>




<p align="left">Gap Inc.’s retail sites seem to render best in Internet Explorer.
    From a quick usability test with Netscape, none of the three sites have any
    problems with the particular browser. However, with Opera, an JavaScript error
    alerts the user that JavaScript is only compatible with versions 4.0 or above.
    Excuse me? As an tester, one might use Opera 6.1 to test Gap but true enough,
    the same error appears at the Men’s section. Furthermore, the JavaScript alert
    is written in lowercase letters, without correct capitalisation, which negatively
    affects the company’s <i></i><i>ethos</i>. Old Navy does not do any better with Opera;
    the rollover effects are ineffective with Opera as the mouse virtually “erases”
    the navigation menu. If Gap Inc.’s sites are not compatible with less popular
    browsers, such as Opera, one highly doubt that such sites are text-browser
    friendly, such as with Lynx.</p>


<b>Audience</b>
Gap Inc., an American-based company, is amongst the leaders of specialty
    retailers around the world. Consumers contribute to the company’s profits
    by making purchases from one or more of these highly recognised stores: Banana
    Republic, Gap (including GapKids, babyGap, etc.), and Old Navy. Although each
    brand name, and thus, a distinctive store, belongs to the same company (Gap
    Inc.), the three stores target different audiences. Although primarily retailing
    in clothing, Gap Inc. also offer accessories and personal care products, with
    every brand in its own style and quality. Most consumers would agree that
    Banana Republic holds the highest quality, sophistication and class in fashion,
    whereas the middle to lower end of the line is attributed to Gap and Old Navy
    respectively. Product differentiation is reflected in various areas of store
    and promotional design. Generally, designs for Old Navy are geared towards
    the younger generation, and gradually progresses toward the career-oriented
    consumers with Banana Republic products. Thereby, Gap Inc. is a product family,
    as one can grow up with products from its company.


<pre><code>Product differentiation is not only reflected in Gap Inc.'s retail stores,
but is also seen across their online stores through design choices. As with
most websites, each has areas of weaknesses in design and usability. However,
to counterbalance minor drawbacks, attributes and strengths contribute to
the rhetorical effectiveness in communicating information of the sites. Design
choices will be analysed in separate sections to discuss the three sites in
greater detail.
</code></pre>


<b>Structural
    Design</b>
Navigational design is a substantial portion of structural design, as it
    provides an interface for the backbone. Each site follows a similar structure
    of a persistent (global) navigation (Krug 62) and if one draws a sitemap of
    site hierarchy, one can classify the websites as being multi-levelled overt
    taxonomy structures (Kress and van Leeuwen 88). In all cases, the superordinate
    (Kress and van Leewuwen 83), or the homepage, is slightly different than the
    rest of the navigational layout and structure (Krug 109).
Homepages serve a greater purpose in addition to aesthetics. The homepages
    have a function to not only promote specific sections of the site through
    graphical saliency (Kress and van Leeuwen), but also to allow a user’s quick
    navigation to various sections for a better browsing experience (Krug 98).
    Although the homepage provides navigational choice for a user, if the menu
    is not clearly defined, one may get lost at the first page. An example of
    this is shown by Gap, as it does not readily differentiate the subsections
    from the main sections: babyGap separates to Baby Boy and Baby Girl in the
    same spot as the previous menu. However, Old Navy clearly distinguishes each
    baby section by colour and typeface.
Perhaps these sites follow too closely to the design of a catalogue (see
    Metaphoric Design), which would hence be the reason for failing to implement
    a search feature to help visitors find specific items. Many retail stores
    contain searchable databases of available inventory, yet these online stores
    lack this function. However, much like Krug’s example (an older version of
    Gap’s website), the sites contain distinctive identifiers including site IDs,
    sections, subsections, utilities, and indicators to mark one’s place (Krug
    61), which serves as a map and a frame to allow one to browse the contents.
    This technique, when implemented well, may be more effective in perspectives
    of marketing strategies, as browsing often increases a visitor’s chance of
    purchasing another item prior to exiting the store. Additionally, designers
    seem to keep users with 800×600 screen resolutions in mind as much of the
    central pages are surrounded with negative “white” space, which
    allows for an optimal experience as users browse throughout the online stores.
    A frame at the bottom of the page leads a customer to gapinc.com and to other
    related pages. However, without the proper guiding of hyperlinks and with
    large graphic images, one might get lost in trying to figure out where the
    “entrance” into the online store is located.
Page titles are apparent in Gap and Banana Republic, which are often defined
    by large graphical banners that act like street signs for visitors (Krug 72).
    In contrast, the clear identity of a page title is lacking in Old Navy, possibly
    because it seems to be a part of the breadcrumb (Krug 78), instead of being
    distinct enough to separate itself from the rest of the trail marker, which
    may cause users a sense of displacement.
Banana Republic’s vertical expandable menu conveys sophistication, which
    adds <i>ethos</i>, through the use of JavaScript. Gap achieves the “classic”
    look by its conventional use of tabs and Old Navy distinguishes its style
    with underlined links (harder on the eyes (Krug 93)) under a vertical navigation
    menu, contributing to its clashing and wild character. Although Gap follows
    convention, it fails to make obvious the direct hyperlink to babyGap (babygap.com).
    However, this might be an intentional design choice, as the company may want
    users to browse through other sections during their visit, thereby increasing
    the chance of more purchases. Often, like this case, hyperlink design closely
    associates with structural design.
<b>Hyperlink Design</b>
For users of the worldwide web, these sites may seem relatively simple to
    navigate through. However, more thinking accompanies each click, as the majority
    of the hyperlinks do not follow conventional guides, such as underlines or
    guiding words, to focus users in purchasing items. One would be able to tell
    that a hyperlink is present through a change in the mouse pointer icon, but
    that would only result in more searching, guessing, and/or assumptions (Krug
    15). The primary means of conveying hyperlinks in these sites is through the
    use of graphics (images and textual graphics). Sites that are catered to a
    younger audience also incorporate pull-down (drop-down) menus. Additionally,
    Banana Republic and Old Navy uses JavaScript rollovers to indicate a presence
    of hyperlinks.
Pull-down menus are used in Gap and Old Navy (stores of “classics”
    and “flair”), which are of much debate as it gives a sense of a
    depth. On the other hand, one needs to scan, which requires time to mentally
    shift through lists of one-lined descriptions and guess at the options.
Using JavaScript with hyperlinks becomes a disadvantage when users try to
    open links in new windows to avoid exiting the site. Only certain users would
    notice (in the status bar) that there already exists an open (new) window
    command in the code (e.g. clicking on the Gap gift box graphic pops up a new
    window). To perform the same action only brings up a “This page cannot
    be displayed” error, which is a very frustrating task and as a result,
    may mislead the user to think that the page does not exist.
In the more interactive sites such as Gap or Old Navy, the e-mail text field
    operates similarly to Krug’s examples of a search field (16). For a novice,
    one may be unclear as to where to enter the e-mail address, but would know
    to press the “Submit” or “Join” button.
Like street signs (or section IDs), breadcrumbs provide users with a sense
    of direction (Krug 75). Each uniquely uses indicators (arrows) to “mark
    the spot” (page) as well as to incorporate a colour change of the hyperlink
    name. Subtly, these sites use conventional means to convey visited and unvisited
    hyperlinks. Some links are set to be underlined in a cascading style sheet,
    even if the user’s browser settings has the underline preferences turned off.
    If, for example, the hyperlink setting were set to hover instead of showing
    as underlines in Internet Explorer, Gap would show the underline links as
    the mouse hovered over the hyperlinks. Unvisited links (blue) in Gap and Old
    Navy differs from visited links (grey), whereas for Banana Republic, it makes
    no such distinction. In Banana Republic’s thinking, it may imply that all
    hyperlinks are going to be hyperlinks, no matter if one has visited them or
    not, which gives credibility to its visitors. Because websites generally load
    from the top to the bottom, with larger images last, the site ID and the location
    of the navigational bar are strategically placed, not only so that loading
    would be faster, but also because many hyperlinks would hypothetically load
    first if they are text based instead of being graphical text.
<b>Textual Design</b>
San serif fonts are used across the online stores. For emphasis, large caps
    and italics at the Gap distinguish certain text from the rest. Much of each
    site’s text is graphical (either as its own image or a part of a graphic),
    and thus has a greater salience than non-graphic based text, which aids in
    capturing a visitor’s attention. In addition, designers opted to use American
    spelling to accommodate the largest audience and because the company is based
    the in United States.
Headers and titles generally are larger, bolder, and contrast with the background,
    which catches the eye of the visitor and perhaps adds to the concept of street
    signs and breadcrumbs (Krug 75). However, some textual descriptions assume
    too much from the visitor. Intermediate users would understand to click on
    the graphic to find out more about Gap’s “Click for coupon” statement,
    but a beginner might just click the mouse anywhere on the page expecting that
    a coupon to appear.
<b>Graphic Design</b>
Because the focus of retail stores appeals to consumers visually, much of
    their advertising is based on marketing concepts. Online stores are often
    a means of promotion and self-advertising, which is effective by not having
    to distinguish itself from other ad banners (Krug 94). Graphics, along with
    text, are merely signifiers of the signified (reality) (Chandler Ch 2). Many
    graphics are designed to have users want what is shown on the images, and
    consequently, to make a purchase online or at a local store. Colour schemes
    and the choice of subjects are different aspects that contribute to this design.
    Old Navy uses solely clothing to sell their items with the exception of the
    baby section, which purposely perhaps stands out the most, as there is a greater
    modality for photographs as type of media (Kress and van Leeuwen 170). Photographs
    portray reality and real-life situations, whereas items of clothing are merely
    inanimate objects. The photograph of a baby’s eye gazing out at eye-level
    with the camera lenses establishes a connecting relationship with the viewer,
    a gaze of demand, which establishes equality through the angle of the camera
    lens (Kress and van Leeuwen 154).
Perhaps Gap and Banana Republic do not have a strict economical budget in
    comparison to Old Navy, as a variety of people in different poses, sporting
    goods from the store, are readily seen across the sites with the participants’
    gazes in a demand or an offer (Kress and van Leeuwen 154). Although Banana
    Republic does not sell products that are targeted toward the younger generation
    (i.e. children and youth), the photograph on the homepage has a resemblance
    of a young family unit, which creates a sense of unity and harmony, establishing
    a sense of welcome to all consumers.
A multitude of people from various ethnic backgrounds and the colours of
    the site create a sensory and naturalistic coding orientation (Kress and van
    Leeuwen 171), which visually appeals to the general public. Many of the medium
    and close shots of people are taken at a frontal angle, involving and intimacy
    of the viewer and the participant (Kress and van Leeuwen 155). There is no
    sense of power, authority, or an impersonal relationship to detract the visitor
    from the site as participants in the photographs generally involve the viewer;
    most of the poses are not (non) transactional actions (Kress and van Leeuwen
    74). Gap’s front page, however, is quite interesting in that participants’
    gazes are not directed at the lens, but instead, are somehow involved in a
    non-transactional reaction (Kress and Van Leeuwen 74).


<pre><code>Many graphics reflect the fast approaching season and the festive holidays
of Christmas, including Old Navy's images of Christmas tree ornaments. Additionally,
models are geared with snowboards (Gap) and sport warm clothing, which suggest
the approaching winter. Such gear provides atmosphere and background setting
for winter clothing (Kress and van Leeuwen 75). One can assume that much of
Banana Republic and Gap also deviate from standard colours (e.g. blue and
white for Gap) and instead, uses a strong, persistent red colour scheme that
matches the season. However, Gap and Old Navy maintains its original colours
to a degree. Gap's blue and white is present in its site ID and Old Navy's
colours seem to clash throughout, fitting to what consumers may be familiar
with at the stores. Even though red is the season's colours, Banana Republic
uses red earth tones, possibly to relay the "safari" feel of the
company's original themes. Furthermore, younger audiences are often attracted
to a higher saturation of colours and colour diversification, which then becomes
a greater means of modality for them. The more mature audiences, on the other
hand, tend to identify with the colour modulation of dichromatic colours and
a lower level of colour saturation as the homepage of Banana Republic or the
GapBody section of the Gap site seem to emphasize (Kress and van Leeuwen 165).
</code></pre>


The alt text that shows up when a mouse hovers over an image is generally
    useful in providing a functional description of what the graphic says, especially
    for those who use text-based browsers (e.g. Lynx on UNIX). Banana Republic
    seems to intentionally leave out alt text for graphics that serve no function,
    such as the one of the family at the front page. Other navigational graphics
    include the use of arrows, icons, buttons and tabs, and are discussed in the
   sections of structural and semiotic design.
<b> Multimedia
    Design</b>
Perhaps the designers omitted multimedia effect such as sound, video or animation
    due to the fact that each site is graphics-heavy, which would mean that loading
    a page would take more time, especially for users who have a slow connection.
    The closest medium to animation would be JavaScript rollovers. Rollovers are
    often used in Macromedia Flash animations, yet can also stand alone. Even
    though Krug mentions that rollovers are often twitchy because of pop-up text
    (113), Banana Republic and Old Navy avoid using pop-ups or uses it minimally
    in navigational design to make its sites are more attractive. In the case
    of pop-ups, the technique is used effectively as the textual description of
    Banana Republic’s letter logos (e.g. W for Woman) are short and that they
    are located near the pointed graphic (Krug 113).
<b>Metaphoric Design</b>
There is a common controlling metaphor present across the sites. One cannot
    help but notice that the website designs resemble store catalogues, which
    in turn is modelled after a department store. Much like a catalogue, each
    online store contains various sections and many graphics that model what is
    trying to be sold.


<pre><code>Icons are visual metaphors of real items. The shopping bag is a highly effective
and recognisable icon. Many retail sites (e.g. Chapters) utilise the shopping
cart concept, and yet if one shops for clothing, one would rarely wheel around
a shopping cart, but rather would have hands full of department store bags.
Although Banana Republic uses the bag concept, Gap and Old Navy's implementation
of this metaphor is more familiar, especially since Gap uses its own "bag".
Each site also has a sample of the items colours by reproducing a colour palette
or a swatch. Banana Republic tries to reproduce the texture and the colours
as closely as possible like an "art watercolour palette", allowing
one to view the colour samples (as available in the store) in a separate window.
</code></pre>


<b>Semiotic Design</b>
Navigational icons are more semiotic representations as compared to being
    metaphorical. Such include buttons and arrows, indicating that certain areas
    are clickable, which directs a user to more information. However, semiotic
    design may overlap with metaphoric design, such as the idea of the “shopping
    bag”. With the “shopping cart” concept, users readily look
    out for, transfer and apply the “proceed to checkout” purchasing
    technique to similar ideas like a shopping bag.


<pre><code>Attributes such as the types and styles of clothing classify the distinct
brands, setting each of them apart from the other, which contributes to the
product family of Gap Inc. Such possessive attributes are a part of exhaustive
analytical processes where store models are the carriers that sport the brands
wear, or the possessive attributes that identify them as being as fashionable
(Kress and van Leeuwen 107). One would classify these images as analytical
processes as they are neither narrative processes nor are they classification
processes as an independent site (Kress and van Leeuwen 93).
</code></pre>


<b>Rhetorical Design</b>
Like most companies, Gap Inc.’s primary goal is to be financially stable:
    to do well and to make a profit. A strive to excel is reflected on each website
    by attempting to get users to make purchases. A secondary goal may be for
    the company to collect as many e-mail addresses as possible for future marketing
    and promotional means. One way would be to promote a sense of belonging by
    allowing one to freely choose whether they want to “join” the hype
    or not.
Rhetorical design reflects every aspect of design, which may mean that Old
    Navy might not get as many purchases as Banana Republic, or the Gap, because
    much of its site content is scattered, whereby in the process, scatters the
    communicative effectiveness. Old Navy’s navigation is even under a different
    system: clothing goods are categorised by occasion, not by type, and there
    are many different hyperlink systems present in every page. On the front page
    alone, Old Navy implements rollovers, graphics, pull-down menus, buttons,
    and customized (through cascading style sheets) and standard hyperlinks (underlined
    text). Moreover, Old Navy changes its promotional feature every week, extending
    a new appeal to the audience. However, the temptation to buy might be dependent
    on the age of the visitor. Perhaps, Old Navy appeals to the younger generation,
    as there are more options for interactivity.
As a recommendation, since online stores are popular not only in America,
    perhaps Gap Inc. should consider extending their service to other countries
    (like Chapters does), to generate even more revenue. Through a detailed analysis
    of Old Navy, Gap, and Banana Republic’s websites, benefits seemingly outweigh
    or, in the least, balance minor design flaws. Thus, one may assume that the
    websites of Gap Inc. are rhetorically effective and contain successful choices
    and decisions of design.

</p><p><b>Introduction</b></p>


  

<p>The idea of changing the world through an individualistic effort
    or action suggests a challenge. Thus, the idea of a 12-week project sounded
    extremely intimidating. How would one insignificant individual, as I, affect
    the world? Although the scope of this particular project is by far no means
    of making any difference to the environment or people around me, my efforts
    has changed my views of start-up online-based companies; thus, changing my
    own little world.</p>



<p>
    Briefly, the problem only became slightly disproportioned because I refused
    to allow a small mistake slip through the corporate system. The scenario occurred
    as follows: I ordered some grocery items online. One of the items did not
    arrive with the delivered goods. Upon questioning, the company neither promptly
    nor effectively resolved the situation. Additionally, I ordered an item with
    expectations falsely impressed upon me by the company’s website, which thus,
    increased my dissatisfaction with the company. What Grocery Gateway does not
    know is that others have likely experienced minor grievances against the company,
    but has not resolved the repeated mistakes. Although in one e-mail, the statement
    says, “Many Customers do not let us know what we can do better, they
    simply stop using our service,” one must realise that some customers
    are content with the company’s mistakes. In fact, Grocery Gateway delivered
    an extra jar of honey to my friend’s place that they did not pay for, and
    for our place, a package of pâté that neither my housemate nor
    I purchased. The mishaps are likely due to the drivers of the trucks or the
    shipping crew for being careless in packaging matching items with orders.
    My cake may have ended up as a bonus for another, just like the honey or the
    pâté had for us. Although the attempt to rectify an error ended
    as a success, I am not entirely certain that my trust in online-based companies
    has not mildly degenerated.</p>


  

<p><b>Method(s)</b></p>


  

<p>Dialogical conversation did not occur in-person. I primarily
    used the telephone and resorted to e-mail as a secondary means of communication
    to place complaints and resolve any misunderstandings on both sides. However,
    much of the rhetorical techniques used will be discussed in the Analysis.</p>


  

<p><b>Analysis</b></p>


  

<p>Because this case deals with a company, much of the discussion
    will be analysing the <i>ethos</i> of Gateway
    Gateway. By applying Aristotle’s theory on rhetoric, I will discuss how
    it uses the appeal toward its customers. From the three appeals, <i>logos</i>,
    <i>ethos</i>, and <i>pathos</i>, <i>ethos</i> seems to be the most applicable
    in this exigency. Aristotle believes that the character of a speaker is almost
    the controlling factor of effectiveness and is projected through the speaker’s
    speeches and through text (Aristotle 37). Unlike deliberative appeals, <i>ethos</i>
    is similar to artistic appeals as the character of the person is evaluated.
    Aristotle establishes that a good <i>ethos</i> is created through a good sense-practical
    wisdom or phronesis, good character-virtue or arete, and good will-eunoia
    (Aristotle 121). Book II expands further on topics of <i>ethos</i> in different
    types of people. Kennedy defines the Greek word to predominantly mean, “‘moral
    character’ as reflected in deliberate choice of actions [or words]” but
    can also mean “qualities, such as the innate sense of justice or a quickness
    of temper, with which individuals may be naturally endowed and which dispose
    them to certain kinds of action” or the “trustworthy character of
    a speaker as artistically created in a speech” (163). The following criticisms
    against Grocery Gateway
    highlight some aspects that contribute negatively to its <i>ethos</i>. The
    discussion will also provide suggested ideas to improve its credibility and
    trust by its customers.</p>


  

<p>In this scenario, the company, Grocery Gateway, represents the speaker. The text or the speeches brought forth
    is represented through the e-mail response team, customer representatives,
    and the company’s website. Understandably, the <i>ethos</i> of the company
    is truly tested when an unsatisfied customer questions the credibility of
    its services and products. However, most people tend to remember more wrongs
    than rights, and upon closer analysis, the standardization of the company’s
    professional demeanour is the flaw that negatively contributes to its <i>ethos</i>.</p>


  

<p><b>E-mails</b></p>


  

<p>I believe that Grocery Gateway tries to show good character (arete) by attempting to identify
    with the audience , through their words in the automated e-mail response(s).
    Firstly, the company admits their wrong by saying, “Please accept our
    sincere apology for the inconvenience we have caused by failing to deliver
    your order as requested.” Furthermore, Grocery Gateway tries to use a pathetic appeal by writing, “We certainly
    share in your frustration as a result of the experience with your last order.
    You joined us to simplify your life, not complicate it.” The automated
    or pre-written e-mails are a solid idea in terms of efficiency and good sense
    (phronesis). The automated response notifies the customer that his or her
    e-mail has reached the company’s office. These two formats of e-mail may have
    worked effectively if the process were previously thought through and executed
    well.</p>


  

<p>Yet, the e-mails create a false premise for promises. One automated
    e-mail asserts, “We will provide you with a response within 24 hours.”
    A reply to my original e-mail of displeasure, however, did not arrive until
    close to 48 hours after the automated response. Furthermore, a quick analysis
    of the bodies of each e-mail indicates that Grocery Gateway’s technique to save time and efforts on the probability of reiteration
    of similar responses cost them in professionalism. The cut-and-paste method
    is apparent as sentences in the company’s e-mails contain incorrect capitalizations.
    Additionally, one may also question the level of education the representatives
    at Grocery Gateway
    has received. Understandably, if the company is not Canadian-based, a fair-as
    opposed to good or excellent-command of the English language may be forgivable.
    However, spelling mistakes and other grammatical errors are littered throughout
    the bodies of the different e-mails. Granted, my e-mail is not up-to-par grammatically
    or in clarity, but quite frankly, I am not risking my reputation with the
    company as I do not rely on Gateway
    Gateway to meet my financial needs.</p>


  

<p>To be more effective and to build <i>ethos</i>, a quick proof-read
    or an edit would improve communication, understanding, and degree of professionalism
    upon both parties. If one is using a word-processing or e-mail application,
    the company might invest in one that has the option to highlight minor grammatical
    errors. For example, Microsoft Word underlines this sentence in one of Grocery
    Gateway’s e-mail to alert the writer of its error: “In order to try
    to make up for the inconvenience,We will get a customer service representative
    to contact you to get your credit card information.”</p>


  

<p><b>Customer Representatives</b></p>


  

<p>Gateway
    Gateway practices good sense (phronesis) by having its customer representatives
    utilize standard verbal phrases, much like the following greeting: “‘Gateway
    Gateway, this is ______, how may I help you?” The brief introduction
    allows the customer to identify that he or she has called the right place
    as the personal “Hello” to answer the phone by a company may leave
    one momentarily puzzled. On the other hand, a customer, like me, will most
    likely ignore the representative’s introduction or forget the person’s name,
    unless the customer representative uses the introduction in a sincere, unscripted
    manner. One may only take the “how may I help you?” question as
    a cue to explain the reasons for why she or he called to risk being placed
    on hold or to deal with an incompetent customer representative, in hopes to
    resolve an issue. </p>


  

<p>Once again, however, the good sense is counterbalanced by the
    lack of knowledge on the behalf of the company through the customer representatives.
    Like the e-mail, one should not verbally quote a response-time of “half
    an hour” if the company cannot meet its approximations, which may sound
    like an insincere promise. Furthermore, if Gateway
    Gateway lacks technological resources, a customer representative as a
    person, should explain the reasons in asking for credit card information instead
    of sounding extremely surprised in at my inquiry, as if one expects everyone
    to pay with a credit card: “But I didn’t pay by credit card. How is that
    going to work?” to which the representative asks, “Oh, you didn’t?
    If you didn’t, then what did you pay by?” A customer does not generally
    know what occurs behind the cubicles of the customer representatives, but
    one will easily come to realise that each customer’s account information is
    stored in an electronic database file as keys echo the representative’s typing
    in bringing up corresponding data. With that in mind, Gateway
    Gateway’s employees should not sound incompetent. Having researched Gateway
    Gateway’s privacy policy for this case study, I now realise that the company
    does not keep electronic copies of credit card information, which is the reason
    why the company calls its customers for the necessary information. However,
    with today’s technology, I would expect that the choice in the form(s) of
    payment should be recorded in the database of a customer. Perhaps, Gateway
    Gateway also shows good will (eunoia) by not further inconveniencing the
    customer in asking one to return a product. One could argue that by telling
    customer to discard the product instead of returning it, there is an implication
    that keeping, reselling, or giving away the product is a viable option. Furthermore,
    the credit for my cake on my account is still active, even after my cheque
    of refund has arrived. I am not too certain whether this is an act of goodwill
    or merely yet another generous mistake on the company’s part.</p>


  

<p><b>Website</b></p>


  

<p>Other factors that contribute to Grocery
    Gateway’s credibility may be the professional layout and design of the
    company’s website. Professionally, the structure and organisation for the
    majority of the website contains a solid <i>ethos</i>. There is consistency
    in layout and design, and navigation is user-friendly. One suggestion to improve
    navigation may be the availability of direct hyperlinking. Currently, Gateway
    Gateway uses URL framing to identify its site and maintains the same address
    throughout its pages, which serves to be frustrating for advanced users of
    the Internet, especially if one is interested in direct navigation. The major
    areas of improvement could be resolving usability issues, especially in the
    ability to support various web-browsers. Surfing through Gateway
    Gateway is flawless with Internet Explorer, and almost error-free in Netscape.
    In using Netscape, Gateway
    Gateway returns one blank page, but with constant testing of its website
    on this browser, once the error is found, it should be easily fixed. As the
    error does not seem appear to be severe, I hypothesize that tests are not
    often performed on a routine basis. Gateway
    Gateway exemplifies good sense (phronesis) in wisely placing a disclaimer
    if it detects the using of Opera, yet another web-browser . Although one can
    continue to surf the company’s website even after a notice of warning, the
    disclaimer provides a caution and explanatory response for the customer’s
    frustrations in not being able to properly log-in with Opera. </p>


  

<p>Minor modifications to product descriptions may be expanded
    upon, to avoid misleading a customer in purchasing the wrong item in the case
    of similar products. Noxzema cream is one example : Gateway
    Gateway adds a comment in the Plus model to separate the differences from
    the regular product; however, one neglects to do the same for the Olay product.
    With almost identical graphics in both cases, one would be easily misled into
    thinking that one product is similar to the other. However, in comparison
    to the e-mail response team and customer representatives, one would attribute
    Grocery Gateway’s
    website as having the greatest <i>ethos</i>, which would most effectively
    target its audience. Marketing techniques are successful using this medium,
    as it is through the website that the company gains its customers .</p>


  

<p><b>Conclusion</b></p>


  

<p>From my experience with Gateway
    Gateway through e-mail, telephone, or its website, the most effective
    and successful means of presenting a case or complaint is through e-mail.
    Although inefficient in receiving a timely response, e-mail appears to be
    the most effective form of communication. E-mail allows the customer to state
    everything in one breath, without interruptions, and gives time for the customer
    to think through the ideas that he or she wants to communicate across. Regrettably,
    I resorted to a secondary means of communication, e-mail, before successfully
    arriving at a satisfactory resolution. If this experience accurately reflects
    my rhetorical effectiveness as a rhetorician, I may need to improve my teché
    as a rhetorical orator as my written communication proved to be more effective
    than my verbal skills.</p>



<p>
    To avoid a negative customer review of the company’s product and services,
    Grocery Gateway
    could apply the theories of Aristotle in its philosophy of thinking. Companies,
    such as Grocery Gateway,
    should apply the theories of <i>pathos</i> and Aristotles’ analyses on how
    minds work, to understand what causes one to be angry, indignant, etc. so
    to understand and better serve its customers. A company may further support
    its <i>ethos</i> through the use of contemporary techniques and <i>pathos</i>.
    Because Grocery Gateway
    is still a young company, there is time to improve and restore its <i>ethos</i>.
    As a solution, Gateway
    Gateway may invest in hiring someone who has experience and knowledge
    in good marketing techniques with background in classical and/or contemporary
    rhetoric.</p>



<p>
    Because my first experience with Gateway
    Gateway impressed a poor <i>ethos</i> on the company, I certainly do not
    recommend their services to others and will likely need evidence of good <i>ethos</i>
    before reconsidering purchasing anything from this company. Although Gateway
    Gateway employs good sense, character, and will, its weaknesses counteracts
    against the company’s <i>ethos</i>. Unless such a company continually takes
    the effort to investigate and change what is needed in order to serve its
    customers in a more professional manner, the company’s <i>ethos</i> will continue
    to suffer. </p>

		<p>				It was a seemingly normal day, <br>
    When they came and took Him away. <br>
    From a place called Gethsemane, <br>
    Where He was praying on bended knees. </p>


  

<p>They put Him to shame, <br>
    As they made fun of His name. <br>
    They struck Him with a splintered rod, <br>
    Because He claimed to be the Son of God. </p>


  

<p>They used metal, glass, bones, and lead, <br>
    To construct a whip that made Him bled. <br>
    Flogged Him forty-times minus one, <br>
    But after all that they weren’t quite done. </p>


  

<p>He suffered from great pain, <br>
    When they struck Him again and again. <br>
    Bleeding, bruised, and almost dead, <br>
    They placed a crown of thorns upon His head. </p>


  

<p>Flesh torn open from the thorns and whip, <br>
    They put a robe around His body and hip. <br>
    It soaked the blood that was shed, <br>
    The royal purple turned scarlet red. </p>


  

<p>They mocked Him and spat on His face, <br>
    The once recognizable man was now at utter disgrace. <br>
    They heeded to drive wrought iron nails through His wrist, <br>
    And through the heel bones without a single miss. </p>


  

<p>‘The King of Jews’ was fixed above His head, <br>
    And on the cross He was crucified and left for the dead. <br>
    Imagine, if you had the power of this man that day, <br>
    Would you throw yourself off the cross and say, </p>


  

<p>“I condemn you all for bringing me through this!” <br>
    For He did no wrong in God’s midst. <br>
    But with a single cry and a soft moan, <br>
    He chose to die even when His Father left Him alone. </p>


  

<p>The man, Jesus, was indeed He, <br>
    Who gave up His life for you and me. <br>
    Who conquered death after three days, <br>
    For He was no longer where His body was laid. </p>


  

<p>So, we are saved by His grace, <br>
    From falling into the eternal fiery place. <br>
    We never truly realize why He freed us of our fate, <br>
    Until we learn that His love for us was just too great. </p>


  

<p>This is where God demonstrated His love, <br>
    He sent His only Son from above. <br>
    We need to give glory where due, <br>
    Because Love sacrificed itself for you. </p>

		<p>				The freshness of the moist morning<br>
    The dampness of dew on the earth<br>
    Fills me up and lifts me high into the sky<br>
    The gentle breeze carries my heart<br>
    Up into the heavens<br>
    To be united with butterfly kisses<br>
    That are sent afar<br>
    The clouds in the sky<br>
    Conceals a hidden mystery<br>
    Waiting to be unwrapped<br>
    The lights in the city twinkle magically<br>
    And the voice of the world<br>
    Drifts musically through my soul</p>
