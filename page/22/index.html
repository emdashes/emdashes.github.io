		<p>				


</p><h3>HK-style cafe</h3>




<li>Christmas Day – immediately after landing, we hit a local HK style cafe for a late dinner in Richmond, which was tasty and filling!</li>




<h3>Family meals</h3>




<li>Boxing Day – our traditional Christmas brunch followed by an extended family dinner</li>




<h3>Sushi and seafood</h3>




<li>Sunday – lunch at <a href="http://dinehere.ca/coquitlam/sushi-california" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sushi California</a> followed by dinner at my aunt’s place where my uncle served us delicious home-baked cinnamon rolls for dessert</li>


<br><caption>All that fish for $41</caption>




<li>Monday – Our first time snowshoeing with a light packed sandwich for lunch (loved snowshoeing by the way), followed by  dinner with the Oh’s at a Chinese seafood restaurant. First time j.w’ s tried sea cucumber and was a first time for him to have lobster and crab combined in a dish. Before lunch we stuffed ourselves with Zoo sticks from White Spot (had to share with j.w the only thing I wasn’t sick of at White Spot when my father worked there for what felt like forever) and their Original sliders.</li>




<h3>Pad Thai and sushi</h3>




<li>Tuesday – we enjoyed a walk in White Rock and <a href="http://dinehere.ca/white-rock/moni-thai-resturant" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">had pad thai</a> with a friend (nicely done al dente noodles), despite White Rock having a great sushi place. Why? We needed to save our sushi appetite for the evening for all-you-can-eat at Toyama, which by the way, I would recommend paying the extra $5 for their deluxe menu (which includes BBQ black cod, BBQ lamb, and wild pacific salmon sashimi mmmm.  Their oysters were delicious too! Discovered that I’m not a fan of sea urchin or geoduck sushi though – really strange textures.</li>




<div style="text-align:center">
</div>




<h3>American portions</h3>




<li>Wednesday – went down to the States and had frozen yogurt for “breakfast”, McDonald’s chicken nuggets for a “filler”, jalapeno pretzel for “lunch”, Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory chocolate-dipped frozen banana for “snack”, and happy hour appetizers at Applebee’s for “dinner”, and a Starbucks Mocha ice cream mini tub for “dessert” (we had to eat it otherwise it would melt on our drive back). My goodness – that dinner is likely one of the most unhealthiest I have eaten – between the 4 of us, we shared 2 pounds of wings, 1 basket of deep-fried onion wings, 5 slices of quesadillas (though we took that home), 1 order of potato skins, 2 orders of sliders and fries.</li>




<h3>Dim sum, seafood, and peking duck</h3>




<li>Thursday – New Year’s Eve lunch with grandparents at <a href="http://dinehere.ca/coquitlam/kirin-seafood-restaurant-coquitlam" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kirin in Coquitlam</a> for dim sum (no longer recommended as a place to go for dim sum). Dinner feasting at home over steamed giant scallops, huge oysters, and ginger and green onion crab! All home-made by mom. The house smelled like fish and soya sauce but it was all worth it. And, new year’s count-down at Miche’s with Earl Grey tea cake for dessert.</li>




<li>Friday – New Year’s Day – we had lunch with the girls at the military woman’s <a href="http://dinehere.ca/burnaby/po-king-seafood-restaurant#node-66010" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dim sum place on Kingsway</a> (near MacPherson) and dinner at a Chinese restaurant with peking duck!</li>




<h3>More seafood and #1 house special drink</h3>




<li>Saturday – a brunch/late lunch at <a href="http://dinehere.ca/new-westminster/boathouse-restaurant-the-quayside%22" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">New Westminster’s Boathouse</a> (not recommended) to celebrate a friend’s wedding! And, because of reservation limits, we had an early dinner at the Cannery (before it closed down forever). Now we can say we’ve been to the Cannery! It’s too bad that I was left with a negative impression when I alerted the hostess that the ladies washroom was out of soap. Her reply? “We don’t have any at all.” What does that mean? Is it because they’re closing in 3 months and they don’t want to be bothered to provide soap for their customers and instead to force them to use bottles of hand sanitizer instead? What do their employees use to wash their hands? *shudder* A filling dinner was followed by a great tasting #1 House Special drink at 8 Juice in Aberdeen (Miche and Tunger’s recommendation). It’s a sago pomelo mango and coconut juice mix and they only had a Medium left ($4.50) when they overheard me telling my sister that they were closed. I’ll be back next time!</li>

</div>




<h3>Chinese food and dessert</h3>




<li>Sunday – very filling lunch with my aunts at a New Lake Restaurant (Chinese) nearby the church, and then a early dinner (which I could barely eat) at another HK style cafe restaurant in Coquitlam (which was decent), followed by Chinese mango sago dessert at <a href="http://dinehere.ca/vancouver/honey-dessert-house" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Honey Dessert House</a> on Kingsway near Boundary. That was good! They also had great service – they kept refilling our lemon water and let us sit there for a good two hours (we left when all the young’uns started coming in which was also an indication that it was getting late).</li>




<h3>Meats</h3>




<li>Monday – lunch at a new Japanese restaurant in Surrey called <a href="http://dinehere.ca/surrey/sushi-tengoku" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tengoku</a>, which are actually owned by Koreans. The portions aren’t bad but it’s nothing outstanding. For dinner, the whole family came over once they heard Ron was bringing steak!</li>




<div style="text-align:center">
</div>




<h3>Taiwanese noodles and shaved ice</h3>




<div style="text-align:center">
</div>




<li>Tuesday – lunch at Aberdeen in Richmond at the new Taiwanese noodle place (great taste but way too pricey for what you get), followed by dessert at <a href="http://www.frappebliss.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Frappe Bliss</a> in the Food Court upstairs. The shaved ice place is absolutely worth whatever lactose intolerance reaction I encountered. In fact, it’s more like flavoured shaved milk with fruit and other toppings for $6 a bowl. I was so full that I could barely touch dinner, which was at home with leftover crab and veggies.</li>





And, that was my holiday in a nutshell :).]]>

		<p>				Wrong boarding pass, delayed flight, no potable water, and misdirected luggage.</p>


<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aimeili/4256100708/" title="IMG_1561 by b.p., on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2701/4256100708_a047b25e32.jpg" width="400" height="266" alt="IMG_1561"></a>


<p>Because of the great experience with WestJet last year with holiday travel, I decided that I didn’t want to risk it with Air Canada and convinced my husband to fly WestJet. I told him that WestJet had the 24-hour no-penalty refund policy, plus that they would take care of you should anything happen with our holiday travels (unlike their major competitor who stranded their passengers last year). Had I known what ended up unfolding, I might have kept my mouth shut, as he now prefers AC.</p>




<h3>Wrong boarding pass</h3>




<p>Upon checking in on Christmas Day, we were warmly greeted by the WestJet agent at the counter, who was still in good spirits despite having to work on Christmas day (something was said about being a WestJet owner!). Perhaps it was Christmas day or our general chit chat that may have distracted him, but after he printed our boarding passes (I guess because only I had mine on my BlackBerry but j.w didn’t), j.w happened to look down and noticed we weren’t sitting together. I pointed it out to the agent, who gave a diplomatic response that essentially meant “don’t look at me – that’s what the system gave me”. I was certain that we booked our seats together when we had checked in online, but as I was about to say something, j.w looked at his ticket again and asked, “Who is Allison Wong?”</p>




<p>For some reason, the WestJet had printed out the wrong boarding pass; it’s likely that Allison’s name was the first name that showed under Wong. Funny thing is that j.w turned around and lo, and behold, the next in line was Allison and we knew her! (yes, the agent was surprised too). By the time we waved her over, he had already ripped up her boarding pass. She wasn’t even going to Vancouver; she was bound for Calgary! At least they caught it – I mean, what would happen if it was only noticed during security…or worse, at the gate or on the plane?
</p>




<h3>Delayed flight</h3>




<p>With that out of the way, we went through security without incident and waited at the gate for (to me) the standard holiday delays – this time for 2 hours. The plane had been caught in Edmonton for deicing, from Kelowna. When it finally arrived, we were moved to a different gate, and Allison had long departed. Because of the rush to move people off and on the plane as they were behind schedule, I have a feeling that’s why they forgot to refill the potable water.</p>




<h3>No potable water</h3>




<p>Yes, in mid-flight, the WestJet attendant announces over the speakers that a strange occurance had happened: they had seemed to run out of potable water; they must have forgotten to refill it in Toronto. What that meant? No more water in the lavatories to wash dirty hands, and no more coffee or tea. Instead they would provide you with hand wipes or bottled water to rinse your hands. I opted for the bottled option, followed by my own hand sanitizer. Still, it felt very unhygenic (especially if you had to come out of the lavatory to get the bottled water).</p>




<h3>Misdirected luggage</h3>




<p>Once we landed, the luggage came very quickly. Well, one of them did. When one suitcase didn’t show up and I asked someone if all the luggage was out, I was directed to the baggage counter. Thankfully, I had kept my luggage tags/claim stickers but it was too late when we realized that no, I was not Allison Wong (due to the check-in mistake!). And yes, my suitcase was waiting at YYC (in Calgary). With promises to deliver it to us first thing the next day, I was happy that at least they were able to locate it.</p>




<p>In the morning, a call came asking if we were willing to pick it up for a $100 WJ credit in exchange, which was a very nice gesture on WestJet’s part. What they failed to tell us was that we had to book a flight within 90 days for a trip within the year. As I didn’t have plans at the time to travel anytime soon, I was a little annoyed that they didn’t tell us the catch when we picked up the phone since it takes us almost an hour to get the luggage and come back. Thankfully, I remembered that I could try and apply the credit to my return flight – which they accepted! Yaay!
</p>




<h3>Epilogue</h3>




<p>J.w says that he’s not about to choose WestJet again if Air Canada is an option. Me? I just booked with WestJet again to attend a friend’s wedding in May :). I must say that I’m not very thrilled at their new reservation system (Sabre). I like their online reservation (and refund) system, but their phone wait times are RIDICULOUSLY long (1.5-2 hours) even after midnight EST, and when you do finally connect to an agent, and they transfer you, it disconnects you! Otherwise, if you try to call the Wedding and Convention line to try and book a seat using a wedding discount code (which by the way, is great when it works), all you get is “all circuits are in use; please try again later” instead of being put in the queue. However, I have learned that WestJet <i>gets</i> social media: if their response times on the phones is as great as their responses on Twitter, I think you would have more happy customers. Now if this was my first time with WestJet, I might jump ship, but why do I still choose WestJet? Generally, it’s because of their attitude towards customers – they seem to care…and it sure beats the alternative choice.</p>

If service is a way to create buzz, it sure worked!
When I called to book a lunch reservation for our FTC Christmas lunch (self-formed Food Tasting Club at work), the gal remembered who I was after I said my name (which brings me to think that even if a restaurant used a CRM database to look up your name, it can certainly add a personalized touch).
Parking is somewhat of a nightmare at Conestoga Mall at the front entrance, and as mentioned before, having no access from the mall means that one only has a few rows of parking to choose from if you prefer a close spot. Anyway, on our way to our original table, one of the FTC members piped up and asked if we could sit closer to the kitchen because he wanted to see the bustling kitchen while we enjoyed our meal. And because of that remark, we ended up getting a personalized tour of the kitchen at the end of our lunch!
Our first server (the one who pronounces all the dishes in its proper Italian form) recognized me from two evenings ago, which amazed me (perhaps it was my BlackBerry smartphone sitting on the table, in the same fashion as before). Turns out, this is his 6th year at O&B and he’s just on loan to Waterloo – we would normally find him at the Bayview Village location in Toronto.
Upon paying, I found out that the <b>menu prices include tax</b>. That is a <i>pleasant</i> surprise! One of our foodies ordered a lobster bisque to start, and maybe it was because the rest of us didn’t order an appetizer, but it seemed like there were at least 5 servers asking if he was finished with his soup when he paused (for long periods of time) or when he didn’t mean to push the bowl away. Is there such a thing as “too much” service? We called it “cruise ship” service (we were talking about cruises and it was quite comical after the third time). Plus, upon returning your credit card, they try to address you by name.
I did try the Al Parma pizzetta and I must admit, it reminded me of pizza in Italy. Crust wasn’t too crunchy/hard or thick, and it had a thin layer of sauce, but plenty of prosciutto. The seared yellow fin tuna salad (background of above photo) looks really good (and many pieces too), but for $21.95, it’d definitely be a splurge for me.
Touring the kitchen was certainly a highlight: Kevin, our server, pointed out the sous chef, head chef (Steve), and O&B executive chef (<a href="http://twitter.com/ChefBestig" target="
_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Markus</a>). The executive chef is in charge of all O&Bs, but I guess he’s ensuring O&B Waterloo has a smooth start. The kitchen is pretty large in size: with areas for the pizza (with its fire-oven), salads, and sandwich making, the prep section along with oven for fresh baked bread (coming soon – right now they’re using ACE artisan bread, which is a great choice), and the dishes area. The server tells that each cup of coffee is made with fresh ground beans and brewed by the coffee maker, which is worth more than his car (hrm, what car?). The side wall is lined with walk-in fridges and fridges).
To top all of this off, Peter Oliver (the Oliver in O&B) was walking around the restaurant chatting with the patrons. At this rate, Wildcraft better watch out: it sure has some competition close by because these guys get it.
Now, here’s to hoping that we can book the team Christmas lunch here…

		<p>				2013 Update: O&B Waterloo is no longer open for business.
—
When chain restaurants and stores that are only in Toronto (or in bigger cities) come to Waterloo, it’s significant. To me, it’s a statement that puts Waterloo on the map, in line with bigger cities.


</p><h3>Oliver & Bonacini Cafe Grill</h3>


Conestoga Mall
550 King Street North
Waterloo, ON
519.772.0783
<a href="http://www.oliverbonacini.com/obcg_waterloo.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">O&B’s website</a>
Date of visit: December 2, 2009


<h3>Restaurant</h3>


Oliver & Bonacini’s was scheduled to open in Waterloo early December (though the mall sign said Spring 2010), but they had already been open for 6 days on our visit. I had neither visited an O&B before nor their sister (and famous) restaurant Canoe in Toronto, but they also partner with SOMA, a place that offers quality gourmet chocolate in the Distillery District.
O&B seems to cater to the young professional crowd, much like Wildcraft does. The interior is casually grand, with modern dim lighting and color, along with high ceilings and edged corners. The dark and light wooden chairs add to the “café” feel, but there’s a feel of space limitations: the entrance foyer is tight, the tables are close to each other, and the meeting/party room has a glass divider that makes it look like a fishbowl (or aquarium to be more accurate). Whether it’s a space issue or for another reason (like the demographics), there is no access from inside the mall though, which has its disadvantages as well.


<h3>Meal choice, food quality</h3>


The menu offered a variety of food choices (but maybe more leaning towards Italian dishes), along with a reasonable range in prices. Most of the dishes are under $20. After much debate on what to try, we decided on the spice & pepper fried calamari to share as an appetizer, followed by a duck, pineapple and coriander bruschetta and a mushroom soup for myself as a main, and the mac&cheese for him.
After taking our order, we were served with two complimentary mini bread buns (ciabatta?), which were hot, soft, and moist. This definitely helped minimize the wait time between this and the appetizer.
The <b>calamari</b> was at the right texture: neither too chewy nor rubbery with light flakes of batter. However, I would likely try the grilled calamari next time (cheaper too!) as this plate was a little too salty and I wasn’t a huge fan of the Indian spices (cumin?) they used despite it being light so that it wasn’t overpowering.
The <b>mushroom soup</b> – this was unlike any other mushroom soup I have had. I’m used to cream of mushroom or a mushroom broth, but instead, it was as the server described it: thick, mushroom purée soup. Tasty, though I wonder if it would still be as good with less salt (though the calamari was much saltier)
The <b>bruschetta</b> (or “brus-k-etta” as the other server distinctly pronounced it <i>Italianized?</i>), was flavourful. My tasting companion commented on the strong smoky smell of the sauce, but it didn’t hit your tastebuds when you ate it. Instead, the fresh chopped pineapple added a great contrast to the flavour. The toast might be less crumbly if it wasn’t so crispy but I liked the fact that it was in bite-sized portions.
And, the <b>macaroni and cheese</b> thankfully tasted nothing like Kraft Dinner. This was more of a homemade baked variety: topped with breadcrumbs, (what could be canned) peas, and melted goat cheese; quite filling too.


<h3>Service</h3>


When our main server wasn’t always around to serve us, another one would be available for our table. Our main server seemed to be very knowledgeable with the menu (and surprised at my knowing of SOMA) and the items on it, and instead of being put off, actually thanked me for my feedback (re: the calamari being on the slightly saltier side). There was a longer wait between the appetizers and the main, but I must commend their service: one server knew I had an intolerance to onions, but our main server didn’t. Yet, our (main) server made sure to check with me and let me know that the mushroom soup had onions in it (though I don’t think he realized that raw green onions are part of the onion family).


<h3>Conclusion</h3>


Closer towards the end of the evening, I asked my companion if this Oliver & Bonacini’s is like the one in Toronto, and from the sounds of things, the themes and overall brand is definitely consistent. It’s a place to try on Mondays and Tuesdays, especially if you like $4.95 cocktails (which are normally priced at $9.95). I would probably try their lunch menu next time, such as a pizzaette or even their grilled calamari.

<h3>$20 Product #1</h3>




<p>Consider the Kitchenaid kettle:<br></p><div style="text-align:center"><img src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41fI6ZnaNkL._AA280_.jpg" style="border:none"></div>

<br>
The design is great – the silicon handle keeps it from getting hot and the wide mouth makes it very easy to clean. Plus, the base is one unit, so that it’s seamless and prevents dirt from getting between the cracks. The spot has some holes so that ideally, the kettle would whistle when the water is boiling. Maybe I don’t know how to use a whistling kettle properly, but the first one I bought from Canadian Tire didn’t whistle at all so I exchanged it. Then, I read somewhere that I should ensure that the lid is shut so no steam escapes except through the spout, but it does anyway. Well, the kettle is far from being “loud and clear”; if it does whistle, you can hear it trying only if you are standing beside it. For $20, I can let it slide, but I wouldn’t recommend anyone buying this product at the regular price ($65?). One would think that a name brand product like KitchenAid deliver better quality, but I was wrong. At least <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Kitchenaid-2-25-Qt-2-13-Kettle-red/product-reviews/B001NWY02S/ref=cm_cr_dp_all_helpful?ie=UTF8&coliid=&showViewpoints=1&colid=&sortBy=bySubmissionDateDescending%20target=" _blank rel="noopener noreferrer">I wasn’t the only one with this problem</a>.

For the same price as the kettle ($20), it’s worth it – despite rendering your original Wii Fit useless. When you first put in the disc, it prompts you install a software update, which may explain some of these features:</p>




<ul><li>Your score board and the games you have already unlocked are transferred</li>




<li>15 new games are introduced (plus a new easter egg and some new exercises and exercise programs)</li>




<li>Calculates how many calories you’ve burnt (whether it’s accurate or not is another story, but it’s based on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_equivalent" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MET</a> scale)</li>




<li>You can easily switch to another player without having to exit out of the menu (unlike the first game) – I think that’s what they mean by the multiplayer support</li>




<li>Little novelty items like adding your pets or new tests</li>


</ul><ul><p>There’s just one thing we haven’t figured out yet: how you convert the weight from kilograms to pounds (like the first game?). Hopefully it’s just a setting.</p>

		<p>				For 2 weeks, I experienced plenty of firsts, including my first cruise on a non-Asian cruise line, and first my time in Europe. Suffice to say, I found that cruising was a great way to enjoy Europe: you wake up in a new destination (almost) every day!</p>


<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aimeili/3987211710/" title="IMG_7663p by b.p., on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2484/3987211710_9ec4740a19.jpg" width="400" height="247" alt="IMG_7663p"></a>


<p>Other thoughts?</p>




<ul><li>My favourite destination was Cinque Terre, a region in Italy that comprises of 5 villages on coastal mountains. To get to each one, one can take a train, ferry, or walk on the trail that connects them. The colourful houses in this area reminded me of….Newfoundland! Since this trip, I have concluded that we take Canada for granted quite easily. For instance, Tofino reminds me of Hawaii, Quebec City and Montreal reminds me of Europe (now I can say that with certainty – in fact, when we were in Nice, I accidentally said to a fellow traveller that we went to Old Quebec when I meant to say Old Nice!)</li>


<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aimeili/3986462479/" title="IMG_8255 by b.p., on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3496/3986462479_7d77a46d56.jpg" width="400" height="266" alt="IMG_8255"></a>


<li>Dubrovnik, Croatia was a second favourite – the coastal city was beautiful, with the red roofs and mostly because I wasn’t expecting too much (despite my physiotherapist’s assistant telling me so, who is from that side of Europe). I guess it’s just not a top destination that you hear many tourists talk about (unlike Rome, Florence, Venice).
</li>


<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aimeili/3986233640/" title="IMG_7486 by b.p., on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2640/3986233640_99c3c906af.jpg" width="400" height="266" alt="IMG_7486"></a>


<li>While j.w liked Rome because of its history, I wasn’t too fond of it not because it was old, but because it was dirty (graffiti and poo everywhere – not just dog poo), and by extension smelly. It reminded me of some Asian cities.</li>




<li>Dogs and cats seem to freely wander the streets of Italy and Croatia. So if you are afraid of them, then be warned.</li>


<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aimeili/3986249796/" title="IMG_7784 by b.p., on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3467/3986249796_75d4dd5c70.jpg" width="400" height="266" alt="IMG_7784"></a>


<li>Train strikes in Italy seem to be random! They can decide to strike for no apparent reason and have it start mid-day and end by 9PM. Thankfully, when that happened, the local buses were running and they ran an extra one to shuttle the tourists to Taormina, which cost the same as the train (6.5 euros roundtrip), but it actually took us to the top (where Taormina is situated). The public transportation system in Europe is just so affordable – the subway is 1 euro one way, (water) buses and trains are inexpensive too. (e.g. KWTO would be $10 RT).</li>




<li>3-star hotels are more like the standards of 2-star hotels here.</li>




<li>I was sadly disappointed with the locals in Barcelona, Spain. The city is seemingly multi-cultural, yet I heard racist remarks directed at us twice! However, at the market, their fresh fruit drinks (like dragonfruit mango or pineapple mango) are sooo delicious and inexpensive. We shared 3  (3 euro total).</li>




<li>Dining in Europe is ridiculously expensive – especially if the place has a cover charge for each person (up to 3.5 euros each!) – the last meal in Rome, we spent $70 CD for a salad, an entree, plus 1 coffee. Ouch.</li>


<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aimeili/3987217396/" title="IMG_8344 by b.p., on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2454/3987217396_4f74048dae.jpg" width="400" height="266" alt="IMG_8344"></a>


<li>Travelling on a inaugural cruise is a great experience – you get to experience everything new for the first time, including new board games (no grimey fingers) and wrinkle free books to borrow!</li>




<li>And, of course, gelato can be as low as 1 euro for 1 scoop in a cone – which works out to be about $1.64 CD.</li>


</ul>

		<p>				In my head, this feels so surreal, so artificial, so much like a production. All this planning and rehearsing, like a play. I think I will be going through the motions and just forcing myself to enjoy most of it (I don’t like being in the centre of attention, nor am I any good at acting any longer). As a child, I used to love acting and participating in plays, musical productions, and interpretative (creative) dance, but I’m not sure what happened over the years to move me away from that shell.</p>




<p>The biggest production of my lifetime is bringing people closer than I would have ever expected. Imagine my mother’s surprise when I told her that one of my friends said that his mother knows her from high school. They had lost contact and when his mother had seen the invitation, she recognized my mother’s Chinese name! (in Chinese, it is common practice to include the surname) What are the odds? My mother now lives on the other side of the country, and my friend’s mother in the GTA. They’ll be seeing each other in less than two weeks’ time. I can’t picture what it will be like to meet my high school friend in 30 plus years and seeing them again at their child’s wedding, but they’re sure excited.</p>




<p>On a unrelated note, my mother gave me a skirt that she bought in HK many years ago. Just the other day, I realized that a friend of mine had the exact same skirt! She bought it in Hong Kong years ago too – the strangest thing is that she and I have this similar fish pouch too that we both got from China.</p>
