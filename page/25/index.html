		<p>				I find that very few companies do customer service right, but the online ones that do, really leave a lasting impression. Here are two of my favourites:</p>




<h3>1. <a href="http://moo.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Moo</a></h3>


Moo, a UK based company, prints photos into a variety of paper mediums (media…) including booklets of stickers. Their emails and packaging slip (that allows you select reason of displeasure) added a really nice touch to ensure customer satisfaction.


<blockquote>
Hello,


I’m Little MOO. We’ve spoken before, I’m the piece of software that
manages your order with MOO.


I’ve done a Very Bad Thing.


Don’t worry – your StickerBook will be fine, but I might’ve lost the
information that tells the real life people at MOO what colour cover
you ordered for your StickerBook.


I might only be a piece of software but I am embarrassed and I do
feel like a bit of an idiot. If you do get the wrong cover for your
book, please accept my apologies and know that someone has fiddled
with my insides and fixed them, and it won’t happen again.


In the meantime, I hope you love the Stickers you ordered.



Very best wishes, and sorry again,



Little MOO.
</blockquote>




<p>The booklet came fine 🙂</p>




<h3>2. <a href="http://www.clearlycontacts.ca">Clearly Contacts</a></h3>




<p>Clearly Contacts is an online (Canadian) store that sells contacts and prescription glasses (their American counterpart is CoastalContacts.com). I’ve tried them for the first time recently and am very pleased with their service and product. They were helpful in answering questions on the phone without a long wait and the best part is that they let you purchase a product without having to pay upfront until you receive it. By the way, I’m going with them in the future when it comes to purchasing a complete pair of glasses (with a recognized brand, high index, anti-glare lenses, made-in-Japan titanium frames) for under $50 CDN including shipping. Even beats the quality of the stores in Hong Kong (bought a
pair for $60 CDN IN-STORE that had the wrong prescription, incorrect focal distance, and poor quality lens resulting in distortion)!</p>




<p style="text-align:center">—————</p>




<p>I would say that the service design of these two companies are well done, which is why they are good experiences in my books. Which brings me to ask, how many of us actually expect to (or prefer to) speak to a customer representative when calling for support? I know when I dial any number, I have the desire to talk to someone on the other end. I don’t like listening to the menu options or entering my PIN or account number (and having to repeat it later). Yet, I’ve been told that customers don’t mind having their questions answered by a telephone recording, as long as it helps. Call me lazy, but I almost always try to press 0 (or see if I could pretend that I don’t have a touch tone phone) to see if I can bypass it all and speak to the operator. Perhaps it would make a difference if I had to wait 3 hours to speak to someone vs. a few minutes (I would simply hang up and try again later or look for help online).</p>

		<p>				I’m so glad that <a href="http://www.westjet.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WestJet</a> travels to/from YKF, as WestJet is now my preferred choice (over AC – assuming the price difference isn’t too much). They have gone above and beyond as I didn’t expect this at all especially since the delays were due to the weather and were relatively short (in contrast to Air Canada)); what a great surprise!</p>


From my travel agent (content edited to protect details):


<blockquote>

		<p>				University of Waterloo Badminton Club on the weekend and because it was my first time playing with them this term, I decided to read the waiver form <a href="http://badmintonclub.uwaterloo.ca/waiver.pdf" target="_blank" title="PDF Waiver" rel="noopener noreferrer">(PDF)</a> that they (and the UW Running Club) expect us to sign before participating.
Two statements in particular caught my eye (bold emphasis mine):


</p><blockquote>WARNING! BY SIGNING THIS LEGAL DOCUMENT, YOU WILL BE GIVING UP CERTAIN LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING THE RIGHT TO SUE.


RELEASE OF LIABILITY, WAIVER OF CLAIMS AND INDEMNITY AGREEMENT: in consideration of approval toparticipate in the University of Waterloo, Campus Recreation Badminton Club, I hereby agree as follows:<br>
______ TO WAIVE ANY AND ALL CLAIM that I have or may in the future have against the <b>University of Waterloo</b>, its Initial directors, officers, employees and representatives, game officials, club executives, my team mates, and other players(all of whom are hereinafter collectively referred to as “Releasees”.</blockquote>


I asked one of the execs, “What happens if the ceiling falls down on us?” to which she replied, “That never happens.” I realize that the probability of happening is very low, but <i><b>never</b></i>?! What if the roof does fall on us because of some maintenance negligence on the school’s part? A former exec once me that the Campus Recreation Membership is for insurance purposes, but the Assumption of Risk page implies otherwise as well.
Can it actually be true? That if something happens to us because of UW’s fault, we forfeit our right to take any legal action or make any claims?
<i>Addendum</i>: Skipperloo pointed out that places like Whistler (PDF) or <a href="https://www.skichicopee.com/registration/winter_programs.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chicopee</a> has a similar form, but at least in those forms, it gives some provisions:


<blockquote>
This Agreement and any rights, duties and obligations as between the parties to this Agreement shall be governed by and interpreted
solely in accordance with the laws of the Province of British Columbia and no other jurisdiction; and



Any litigation involving the parties to this Agreement shall be brought solely within the Province of [Province name] and shall be within
the exclusive jurisdiction of the Courts of the Province of [Province name].

		<p>				Wow, in less than 6 months, the big day arrives. 6 months! Panic sets in at the realization of only ~24 Saturdays left of planning.</p>




<p>I’m excited about our wedding favours – found something that we actually like and that people may actually use; let’s hope we can afford it.</p>




<p>Our invitations are also in progress; I forgot how hard it is to create the “perfect” invitations.  Want to get ahead of the crowd? Give us your address so that we can send you an invite when the time comes. Unfortunately, we have to limit the number of guests but I wish it was an open party!</p>

Following Web Directions North in Denver, it was a blessing to be able to fly to Vancouver to join the <a href="http://interaction09.ixda.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Interaction ’09</a> conference at the Four Seasons hotel in downtown Vancouver. A few observations at this one:


</p><ul><li>Working notes at <a href="http://docs.google.com/View?docID=dwvxjdg_20g9cfzmf3&revision=_latest" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Docs</a></li>




<li>Definitely a different calibre than WDN; more artsy, less technical.</li>




<li>For a conference on interaction design and user experience, I would expect much more in terms of contact information and response time</li>




<li>I hear that signage was lacking on the first day as well</li>




<li>Great sessions and keynotes overall. Learned what I want to do and what I want to avoid</li>




<li>I want to avoid sounding elitist/elite (1337). Please gently remind me that this is not where I want to be/end up if I stick with interaction design.</li>




<li>Sketching is good. I’m glad that one field embraces sketches and doodles as a part of work.</li>




<li>People take notes in lo-fi (paper) notebooks! Most do not use their wi-fi notebooks (laptops) and one workshop forebade the use of mobile devices or laptops (as a result, I have yet to process my notes digitally)</li>




<li>Yet, the meaning of twitter became really apparent really quickly – each session had its own unique twitter ID (hash/tag) and tweets were posted on the screen in real-time</li>




<li>A free upgrade to King Executive Suite was a definite bonus. Thank you, <a href="http://www.fourseasons.com/vancouver/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Four Seasons Vancouver</a></li>

Outside of the conference randoms:


<ul><li>WestJet deicing fluid is neon green</li>




<li>WestJet forgot(?) to check for my photo ID from Vancouver to Calgary – perhaps because they were distracted by me boarding early (emergency exit row) with an emailed (electronic) boarding pass.</li>




<li>Air traffic: I randomly looked out the window enroute to YKF and noticed an Air Canada plane zoom by the other way. Wow, planes do fly really fast when you have something to compare it to – one blink and it was gone.
</li>



<li>Over-ate. Sampled Kintaro (ramen) and Miku (sushi)…mmmm to both! Would have liked to try a Japadog, as recommended by a Japanese friend and his wife</li>




<li>Enjoyed bubbletea with Boy, his wife, and Asher</li>




<li>Fondue dessert night with friends after a grand dinner with family (peking duck!)</li>




<li>Shared many meals with family together</li>

		<p>				Since the <i>upgrade</i> from Vista to XP, I can’t believe that I forgot to turn on ClearType, which gives an anti-alias feel to fonts – a smoother effect that I prefer. But, it does look blurrier. That’s why my site fonts looked so different to me and I couldn’t pinpoint why until last night (I actually think Isaac Tai told me about this a <i>very</i> long time ago). And, I’ve changed my settings at work too since I recently reformatted that as well.</p>




<p><b>How?</b></p>


Control Panel > Display > Appearance > Effects.<br>
Select ClearType and use the following method to smooth edges of screen fonts.<br>
Apply. All done!]]>

		<p>				I can’t seem to find this tip in my archives, so for those out there who have Rogers Internet, you can also get Flickr Pro for free, thanks to them!</p>




<p><b>How?</b></p>




<p>Simply associate your Rogers account to your Yahoo account and sign into Flickr with it. I don’t remember what I did but from searches on Google, it seems you can log in to your Rogers webmail and click on the “Photos” link at the top right corner of the page where you will be redirected to Flickr to sign up for the pro account.
</p>




<p>Or, for existing Flickr users, you can try to take your Rogers email ID and update your Flickr account to add your Rogers Yahoo email address.</p>




<p>Enjoy!</p>




<p>PS. And to make my life even more convenient, I use Picasa to manage my photos and upload them Picasa post-processed (including the captions) by using the <a href="http://picasa2flickr.sourceforge.net/install_v2.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">picasa2flickr</a> plug-in/button after installing the Flickr Uploader.

Who would’ve thought? I knew we would have a white Christmas; it fact, I knew that we’d have a white Christmas from coast to coast this year, but I didn’t actually <i>expect</i> it to last this long! Thankfully we went to Vegas for a few days to escape from the snow. Anyway, this Christmas has been very unusual: spent extended 1:1 time with parents (sister living w/ now-husband, brother in HK), didn’t spent time with many friends (apart from New Year’s Eve, tea with virtualawrence and dinner at BP), had big family Christmas gathering cancelled because of the snow and flu (twice!), dinner with sister’s in-laws cancelled (flu), hair and docotor appointments cancelled twice (snow), lunch and bubbletea plans cancelled (snow), and even church cancelled (snow). I didn’t expect to spend so much time at home with family, but it’s a blessing (like playing blokus with parents). With church being cancelled, I didn’t have chance to see my friends either (including baby Asher and his parents, a Hebrew name meaning happy”, albeit my first word-association to “ash”) but maybe this gives me a chance to visit <a href="http://www.facebook.com/home.php#/group.php?gid=2224430714" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Surrey Christian Alliance</a>, a church I attended for a few years when I was in high school and see how it’s changed and grown.
Nostalgia. In speaking with a friend on the phone today, I’m reminded of our past lives (and of our ages). We spoke of unrequited affections (or conscious decisions for risking certain relationships) and made me think that some of my closest guys friends are now either engaged, married, have (or will soon have) children of their own. Our lives have all taken a different path whether I expected it or not. I’d never imagined that I would be settling down out East (and I’m still in denial at times, but a good reason to miss the 10 year reunion – who goes to those anyway?). I’m still a local girl at heart, but God seems to have other plans for now, an adventure in the making: 2009 will certainly mark a new chapter of my life – an exciting one I hope!]]>		</p>

I can see how unhealthy (spiritual, physical, mental) it could be: eating lots, sleeping late and/or little, spending money gambling, sensual girls (or invitations to them).</p>




<p>Being my first time in Vegas, I must say that it is bigger and better than I expected: less tacky than Clifton Hills in Niagara Falls and it turns out we didn’t have enough time to see all the big hotels and the themes within each. Didn’t gamble, didn’t go clubbing. What did we do? The freebies we saw included the volcano at Mirage (free view of white tigers now replaced by a BLT burger place), fountains at Bellagio, Lion habitat at MGM, and we accidentally stumbled into Excalibur’s arena (much like Toronto’s Medieval Times) to see the boys practice on their horses (by going through the elevator). We went to the Fremont Street Experience too early (starts at 6pm) so we missed the ceiling light show! The view from the Eiffel Tower experience is quite the sight on a clear night, and at $12, it’s relatively inexpensive compared to what other attractions charge.</p>

<p>While Vegas still isn’t my top choice for a vacation, it’s an idea for a weekend getaway if you’re coming from the West Coast since the promotional prices can be quite attractive. Our friends (and <a href="http://wikitravel.org/en/Las_Vegas#Buffets" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wikipedia</a>) had recommended <a href="http://www.bellagio.com/restaurants/the-buffet.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the Buffet at Bellagio</a>, so we waited in line for about 2 hours for a $40 dinner buffet that had lamb, prime rib, kobe beef, free range turkey, goose, gourmet pizza and flatbreads, ethnic dishes, sashimi, sushi, salad, and dessert. The line wound around and around like you’re waiting in line for a rollercoaster ride – if you lined up at the end of the line, you’d be waiting up to 3 hours, and after you pass a certain point, it’s an hour wait.  Even though the food choices were gourmet, I’m not convinced that the buffet was worth the wait for the inconsistent quality and the price, especially with my appetite. (buffets must be a better deal for those expectant mothers!)  The chocolate raspberry mousse cake is so much better at Premiere Moisson, but the rack of lamb was likely the best tasting choice of the meal (had 5 pieces). The buffet we enjoyed at <a href="http://www.harbour-plaza.com/en/restaurant.aspx?hotel_id=hpme&section_id=rest&subsection_id=promenade" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a hotel in Hong Kong</a> is by far better.</p>




<p>On the other hand, of all the meals we had in Vegas, my favourite was at <a href="http://www.grandluxcafe.com/aboutus.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Grand Lux Cafe</a> at the Venetian, which surprises me that it’s a chain (by the Cheesecake Factory folks!) because the food prices, portions, quality, and the service was the best of what we had throughout the 4 days there.</p>

<p>During one of our days there, we booked a bus tour with <a href="http://www.vegasbbb.org/rptrel.asp?bbbid=56779#bci" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">looktours.com</a> to see the Grand Canyon West. What’s strange is that the “internet booking price” was available for a phone booking by another couple we knew, but <a href="http://www.vegasbbb.org/bbb_acc_rpt_s.asp?bbbid=52209&rmode=unsatnon" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the original tour company</a> we were going to book with were sold out. Turns out, both of them have quite the unsatisfactory rating on the Better Business Bureau. What’s ironic, is that in the looktours.com website, their <a href="http://www.looktours.com/faq.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FAQ</a> actually leaves in the editor’s remark about whether their statement of being “a proud member” of these organizations are true! (which they are no longer)</p>




<p>The day started on pretty positive: we received a service call at 5:15 AM by the tour company to make sure we were awake. Just thinking that they would have to do it for every party/room is pretty good service. They told us to meet them at 6:10 AM sharp, but not only were they late, the bus ended up back at our hotel for unknown reasons to us after circling around to pick up more people. Maybe we were not informed very well, but the bus that picked us up was not the tour bus. This bus simply shuttled everyone to a random building (unmarked with the company name from what I could tell) and the herded the people into two groups: South and West rim tours. The shuttle bus driver pretty much told everyone to fight for a spot at the front of the line so that you could get a good spot on the double decker bus. Before that, you had to line up to pay the surcharge that you couldn’t pay over the Internet (I’m not sure why). From what the tour operators said, it seemed like this was operated by one company but the tour could be sold by multiple (same?) companies. We were told we would be back by 5:30 PM so those who had show tickets could see them.</p>




<p>The buses are quite nice: clean, spacious, double-decker. Thankfully, we were on the first bus so we loaded quickly and ended up at the site quickly. The bus tour guide warned us multiple times (“for the risk of sounding repetitive”) that we needed to be back onto the bus on time or they would leave. The consequence of the late people would be to take a private plane back, which could easily be $300 one way. He also mentioned that it was “the second busiest day” of the season (not sure why), but while we were there, there were no line ups and few people. He advised everyone on the bus to avoid visiting Hualapai Ranch (a Western theme) because of time constraints and he made it sound like there wasn’t much to miss there. It actually sounds like quite the happening place from what folks tell me and I kind of regret missing it. In fact, I would’ve prefered going there instead of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Canyon_Skywalk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Grand Canyon Skywalk</a> anyway, which is a really gimmicky experience: the glass somehow distorts the perception and feeling of depth – my heart pounded more at the distant edge of the canyon (on the ground itself instead of being over the canyon).</p>


<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aimeili/3153418164/" title="IMG_3489 by b.p., on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3122/3153418164_f39bfe2e3d_m.jpg" width="200" height="133" alt="IMG_3489"></a> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aimeili/3152594637/" title="IMG_3522 by b.p., on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3128/3152594637_b9c0e10374_m.jpg" width="200" height="133" alt="IMG_3522"></a>


<p>Turns out, most of our bus missed the peak of the traffic. 75/81 got back in time, and we all were stuck waiting for over 2 hours for 6 people to return. According to our driver, 400 people “suddenly” showed up and people were in lines for the Skywalk, the shuttle, everything and “they” (who knows who “they” are) weren’t allowing any buses to leave. I’m not sure what to believe – was the first warning to be on time just a empty threat because the buses had to wait or was it truly an exception? The couple we knew waited for almost 2 hours to get on the Skywalk and for 20 minutes for a simple hotdog lunch after their heli/boat tour while waited less than 5 minutes for the Skywalk and a buffet lunch; they didn’t even have time to stop in Guano Point. Guano Point definitely offers a better view in comparison to Eagle Point (where the Skywalk is). So from 3 PM until after sunset (past 5:30 PM), we were waiting.  Finally, the bus driver switched 6 people from the 2nd bus over to ours and we headed back…into a very long traffic jam at Hoover Dam (which isn’t the drivers fault but wondering if we could’ve avoided it if we left earlier).  We didn’t return to our hotels until after 7:30 PM but apparently the switch allegedly costs the driver a 3-day suspension but I’m glad that happened because the other bus didn’t return until after 9:30 PM. He also told us that it’s illegal for tour (charter) buses to drop off at CAT stops along the Strip or risk a $500 fine but I can’t find any documentation on Google about it (he did it anyway).</p>




<p>Next time? Do research on tour company online before booking. Avoid the Skywalk. Try South rim next time or go on the helicopter/boat tour instead.</p>
