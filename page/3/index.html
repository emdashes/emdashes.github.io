		<p>				Homeschooling


I have been reflecting a bit about school for the past few months – in fact, this post started as a post about homeschooling back in May, as more and more families we knew were homeschooling or planning to homeschool. I briefly considered it, and even paid to check out the <a href="http://www.kwchea.ca/conference.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">KWCHEA</a>‘s homeschool conference exhibit hall to look at resources and get a better sense of what is available for a homeschooling family.  While buying into curriculum and paying for supplementary classes to supplement a child’s education / learning can be costly (vs. free public school education), I found that there were plenty of free resources (and you could develop your own curriculum as a result) and quite a bit of local support (e.g. free gym time for homeschooled children, email lists) so that you could still have social interaction with other peers. I also found that there were a few memberships that were free to join if your oldest child is under 6 years old,  which gives you access to a support network and perks like (significant) discounts to places like Great Wolf Lodge. But, what a vendor said got to me – partly because my first feeling was “no, it’s not!” but then I know that there is some truth to what he said: he basically told me that home education was God’s calling for all Christian families because the responsibility lies with the parents to teach their children and because that was how it was done historically/biblically (ie. why leave it to other people to do that). I thought about the examples in the Bible, and how children learned their father’s trade as an apprentice (yes, that supports what he’s saying), but then didn’t the young men go off to the synagogue to learn scripture from the pharisees / teacher of the law? And if it’s God’s calling for every Christian family to homeschool their children, that must mean that most are ignoring His calling – is that possible and true? With homeschooling, I know I don’t have to be as worried about the impacts of early sex education, or the in-your-face celebration of gender rights and gay pride, but I don’t want to shelter my kids either.
At first, I didn’t want to consider homeschooling my children because my first exposure to a homeschooler wasn’t a very positive experience, when a student who had attended a public elementary school, then moved to being homeschooled (maybe due to her being teased for being a Jehovah’s Witness?), and then in high school tried to transition back, but she didn’t last very long and was pulled out. So, I’m biased to think that the transition from home education to public might be really difficult and not successful.


</p><h3>Public education</h3>


Among the selfish reasons why I didn’t want to homeschool is that I didn’t want to deal with the social isolation, or forcing myself and the children to interact with other homeschooled families – or trying to find ways to be socially involved, be it signing up for supplementary classes ($) or leading co-op-like initiatives. Then again, while I excelled and really enjoyed the academic parts of school, I don’t think I really felt like I truly fit in socially (oh, the insecure me, but perhaps it’s reflective of what the Bible says about being in this world, but not of it, or <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-11.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">being foreigners</a>[ref]”If you were of the world, the world would love you as its own; but because you are not of the world, but I chose you out of the world, therefore the world hates you.” Matthew 5:19 ESV[/ref]). Maybe it was due to a combination of language struggles, cultural differences, and a Christian upbringing; I’m not really sure.[ref]Case in point, 6-year-old-me awkwardly learned that just because the teacher is Chinese, it doesn’t mean that a) she speaks Chinese and b) that she can read my name in Chinese, when the worksheet says “Name:” on it. Likewise, just because she is Chinese, it also doesn’t mean she knows what <span id="result_box" class="short_text" lang="zh-TW"><span class="">白花油 is and its medicinal purposes – and will tell you to take it off because it smells -_- (embarrassed of my mom moments) . Though, </span></span>I was super happy to find a Chinese student (Canadian-Chinese) who appreciated my baked BBQ pork bun lunches.[/ref]
One downside of following the crowd, kids these days are entering the education system as early as 3 years old, and at full days – without naps – too! Great for paying parents as they can save on childcare expenses, but for those young ones who have meltdowns because of missed naps, personally I think it’s too much, too soon (probably because my generation started as young as 4 years old only at half days). Actually, it’s nice that kindergarten is optional for families here, but if I hold them back, I feel that they would miss out on key social interaction development and other learning milestones and will lag far behind when starting Grade 1, especially if one throws in French immersion into the mix.
I pray that her social experiences be better than mine, especially as she navigates the first few years of school! And I pray as a parent, that we’ll be responsible for keeping on top of what is being taught so that we can supplement with truth and a biblical worldview when necessary.


<h3>Change</h3>


As we transition into a new chapter of our lives (including new morning routines and making school-friendly lunches), I’m comforted that even though I was a bit disappointed to learn that there are 6 kindergarten classes in her school and none of her friends (or the other couple of kids we know) are in the same class, she is really excited and looking forward to starting school (much more so than when I teach her in Sunday School). After going through the <a href="https://www.strongstart.ca/programs/get-ready-for-school/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Get Ready for School</a> program, she has loved programs and have done so well in them.  When people ask me if we’re ready, this blogger mom sums up my feelings quite well: <a href="http://blog.mops.org/paving-the-runway/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“She was so ready – that made one of us.  I’m not sure if I’m finally relieved to have some time to myself [or more time with the youngest, rather] or if I’m just terribly sad”.</a>  I know little brother will miss her dearly too, and I’m sure I won’t know what to do with just him at the beginning but here’s to change, God willing!]]>

</p><h3>Last minute trip</h3>


A few weeks ago, j.w found out that his company was sending him to Vegas. The initial plan was that we leave Bean with the grandparents for a few days while taking the baby with us. Except Vegas was 45C, feeling like 50C outside, and it isn’t exactly the most baby-friendly place. Plus, <a href="http://her.happyhippos.ca/2009/01/vegas/">I’ve been to Vegas before</a> and decided that being there once was enough.  So that left me with the option of staying home with the kids, in Toronto with the kids, or…I could pay an extra ticket and take all the kids with me to visit family in Vancouver; after all, Bean has been asking about when she could visit her cousin for months now – plus, I could help with kid-sitting since my mom’s sprained ankle wasn’t much better so she couldn’t take my sister’s kids. Turns out, my brother-in-law’s brother (does that make him brother-in-law too?) – who has no kids – was really awesome with the kids; they all loved him, and by the end of it, my crying boy loved him and Bean even chose him to drop us off at the airport –  over her aunt and grandma!  I could even leave him with 4 kids while I did dishes – made me think that maybe that’s what having an au pair feels like. We both concluded that <strong>two adults watching four kids is so much easier </strong>than one adult watching two, especially with the girls and boys being so close in age – the girls often went off giggling and up to no good, while the boys were okay in each others’ company, even though they didn’t really play together much – other than around the train set. We also talked about how having more children at a home daycare is better because of this and you get paid more. Sleep was probably the biggest challenge, with him waking up at 5-6am the first few mornings, and having them sleep in on the two days that count: for church and the day of departure. Thankfully, with the two girls sleeping in one room, I didn’t really have to be with her although I felt bad that I often neglected her to try to put the youngest to sleep. My admiration for single parents have increased tenfold, especially if they don’t have any other family support around them to deal with sleep time, meals, meltdowns, and accidents. Trips out west generally feel really short even if it is longer than two weeks, but it seemed that 10 days was good enough this time – despite missed connections with old friends (we tried!); by the end, I felt I needed another vacation after this one.


<h3>On the plane</h3>


Speaking of departure, there’s nothing like hearing your name on the intercom at the airport along after the generic “final boarding call for flight xxxx  to Abbotsford; paging passengers L and W” that gets your legs going – while towing a preschooler in the car seat that’s strapped around the carry-on suitcase [ref]thanks to an idea from the internet – I saved $30 and used a non-weight tested luggage strap, carabiner and keychain ring, and the car seat tether instead – probably would be safer if I had used a weight-tested carabiner and O-ring instead [/ref] and carrying the baby in the ergo – and feeling sweaty by the time you settle into your seat on the plane. Thankfully, we were at the end of the second moving sidewalk already when I heard my name so it wasn’t too far for me to sprint there and wave, “we’re here – wait for me!”.
I don’t know what happened to the time, but we left church late, met with some traffic on the road, and of course, everything just takes longer with kids; thankfully, I had no luggage to check-in (another great thing about having cousins close in age and size). But by the time we were through the family line in security, I looked at one of the screens and noticed that there was only 15 mins left until departure so instead of taking the friendly security officer’s advice to wait for a golf cart (I did go there to see if a cart was around). Actually, everyone was super kind at security and on my flight – they let me take the baby through in the ergo and didn’t even scan it, and perhaps I was last on board, but they offered to take my (heavy 25lb+) suitcase and ended up stowing it overhead up front (I told them I didn’t need anything in it, so I would also be okay if they decided to check it) and carrying my car seat into our row, while I took care of the kids and the backpack. As we were settling into our row, one of the flight attendants strongly suggested to the passenger in our row to move to another row – back 10 rows! She politely declined, saying that she was fine, but with some prompting from the flight attendant saying that it would give us some wiggle room and that she wouldn’t be sitting beside anyone, she finally agreed, and I thanked her with relief. Had I known that there were empty rows, I would’ve volunteered to go back, but I had asked if it was a full flight, and the answer I got was that there were only a few seats here and there. So we got a whole row to ourselves, with was great, as it allowed the kids to spread out and take turns in the car seat and the other seat.

Unfortunately, Bean didn’t sleep at all (thus missing her nap) and little brother only got in a 30 minute nap at most both on the flight there and back. I do celebrate mini-successes though: on the first flight, I  did manage to transfer him into the car seat so that I could take her to the washroom. The second time she had to go, I picked a child-friendly show I had previously downloaded from Netflix on the iPad and gave him some snacks to munch on; alas, when I had to go the third time, he didn’t like it, so I took him with me. On the way back, he didn’t complain at all! Snacks (apple chips, <a href="https://broghies.com/whats-a-broghie/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">puffed rice crackers</a>, and baby food pouches, and the plane’s apple juice diluted with water) and new toys / activities (stickers, coloring, mini puzzles) kept them sane, but what worked on the 5 hr flight there didn’t work for the flight back – I only needed to take out 3 activities (1 for the boy) and the snacks for the short 3.5 hr flight back (wow, that’s some tail wind!), perhaps because the Dreamliner had the in-flight entertainment console (minus the sound – didn’t bother with earbuds), and the really cool shade button that adjusts the brightness and darkness of the passenger window pane. While we only got two seats to share among the three of us, it seemed more spacious than the Air Canada Rouge plane to Abbotsford – roomy enough for the boy to nap on my lap (again, for less than 30 minutes because he woke up upon transfer when Bean needed to use the lavatories) and for him to stand and sit on the floor in front of my seat.

This trip felt very different because it was more about spending time with my sister’s family than seeing friends, trying new places, or going out. We did go out – often fitting the kids in 4 car seats in my sister’s Rondo + 2 adults in front, but it was to do kid-friendly activities, which were:

<script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script><strong>A visit to Ikea</strong> for play and lunch: this happens regularly in my sister’s family, but Bean was finally tall enough to play in the ball room so it was her first time; we took the boys to the unsupervised kids area in the showroom to play. At lunch, one of the staff pointed out the computer that was near the cash that lists all the ingredients in their food – the fish and chips were not safe (contains dairy), but the chicken fingers were safe so I got a kids meal instead with fries.</li>


    

<li><a href="http://www.coquitlam.ca/parks-recreation-and-culture/sport-and-recreation/dropins.aspx#Aquatics" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>$1 swim</strong> at the local community centre</a>: on Tuesdays and Thursdays, it’s only $1 a person, and the warm pool and communal change room is very large (with private changing stalls and showers in the latter) and you have a lot of accessories to use like life-jackets, floating boards, toys, and duck boats, plus you only need a quarter to lock up your stuff in the lockers AND you get your money back when you open it again. Don’t bring a water camera into the pool though, they don’t allow it. The littlest in our group ended up falling asleep on a duck boat when my sister took the two girls to shower.</li>


    

<li><strong>A meal at Red Robin</strong> meant you had unlimited sides – and they make the birthday girl stand up in her (high) chair when they sing their birthday song. I like independent restaurants but I have discovered that chain restaurants, like Red Robin, tend to be much better at providing ingredients / allergen information for each menu item. By the way, if you have the app, if you end up earning the 10th burger free on your visit, it will automatically trump any other promotion you may be offered, including 20% off your bill. Each kid also gets to take a balloon home where it is played with for days after.</li>

The kids seemed to enjoy it as much as I did way back when. This time, I got to see and use the (finally done) Compass system for the first time, and going on a Saturday meant that everything was one-zone fare – and we managed to make all our connections before the time was up each way! There’s a small but free twirly slide into a pit of balls at Lonsdale Quay, but I forgot socks for my kids, so I took them to see the coin rides instead. I didn’t have money, but the $1 double decker London bus ride would’ve been the best value as it could’ve easily fit 4 kids in it – plus there’s a TV screen inside that acts like a window. Splurged on some local peaches and <a href="http://www.coconama.com/learn/nutrition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">coconama chocolate</a> because they had some nut and dairy-free versions (I’ve sampled some before but I can’t remember where – perhaps at the Handmade Show at the PNE). We were treated to some live music by a very talented young boy while we had our lunch, and I was surprised that my son ate an entire dynamite roll for lunch.</li>

<script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script><strong>A visit to Science World</strong>: they have added a relatively enclosed section [ref]with a staff member at the entrance monitoring who goes in/comes out – hoping to keep stray kids inside I think[/ref] dedicated for 0-5 year olds, which was amazing; they could have easily spent their entire day in this gallery – it had a climbing structure (no slide, but I’d recommend bringing socks), sensory play areas like water features, giant lite brite panel, kaleidoscope, balls, foam building blocks and plastic pipes, and a scoop-and-dump oatmeal-like area. The girls didn’t care for most of the shows, but we all enjoyed the bubble show on the main stage. The best part is that my sister found a <a href="https://www.scienceworld.ca/chinese-coupon-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2-for-1 admission promotion</a> posted on their site for those that can read Chinese. Odd, but we used it!</li>

On the other days, the kids were happy to play in the yard with bubble guns and on the make-shift slide that their uncle made; the water table made its first appearance outside, and was actually filled with water (that I had forgotten was gifted to Bean when she was born – but was then re-gifted because there was no way would we lug a table back). So thankful that the weather was really good during the time we were there – not too wet and neither too hot nor too cold!  Now, I’m looking forward to when my sister and her two come to us in September – she decided to brave the flights too! I am hoping it will still be warm enough to try water beads with them and sidewalk chalk fun then, and maybe even the mini parachute from Amazon Prime Day.]]>

Thankfully, that wasn’t the end of babywearing: a $21 <a href="http://www.mamankangourou.com/en/product/asiatik--mei-tai-type" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hybrid mei dai / stretchy wrap by MamanKangourou</a> seemed to be a good find which ended up working really well for us when she was smaller[ref]minor complaint are the long straps[/ref] – at that point, I had no idea what the carries were (mei dai / stretchy wrap?) and had never heard of the company, but I enjoyed its coziness / snugglies, the extra neck support, and she enjoyed napping in it especially during Sunday church service, and when she was big enough to fit in a suspected fake[ref]which the company refused to confirm because it wasn’t purchased from the retailer vs. Sophie the Giraffe’s company who confirmed that a hand-me-down one was old, but authentic[/ref] ergo hand-me-down without the infant insert, she liked to be carried in that as well – even into toddlerhood. A friend allow loaned us a linen Sakura Bloom ring sling, but I didn’t have the heart to use it all that much because of its cost!
Baby #2 might have been neglected in some things for better or worse (#secondbaby), but this time around, I looked into getting a ring sling that wasn’t crazy expensive and found one on Etsy for $40 after not being able to source any local handmade ones. When it came, it wasn’t as soft as I expected so it was harder to adjust, but with the help of my chiropractor, she showed me how to use it so that it’s comfortable for baby or toddler and me; maybe it wasn’t broken in yet, but now I know that the sling is probably made of duck cloth (one-sided print).
Enter the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/DIYBabywearing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DIY Babywearing</a> Facebook group. I don’t know how I ended up on there, but I’ve learned a lot from this community, with one successfully completed project: an Ikea <a href="http://www.ikea.com/ca/en/catalog/products/20327709/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stilfull</a> tablecloth converted to two soft no-sew (but hemmed) ring slings! Had I known about how easy and inexpensive it is to make your own wrap/carrier, I would have done it from the start, and used $15 instead of paying $40 for one. I’m likely at a <a href="http://wiki.babywearingdiy.com/do/view/Main/WrapCarries" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">base size 5</a> so I can use the Stilfull tablecloth length for size 2 carries and under when I don’t want to use the rings, including the following front/hip carries:

By the way, I got my weight-tested rings from <a href="http://babywearings.ca" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">babywearings.ca</a>, a partnered Canadian reseller of <a href="http://slingrings.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">slingrings.com</a>, which is pretty much the go-to place to get babywearing rings. They’re good because of their weight and because they aren’t welded together so they won’t risk tearing the fabric or irritating the baby – my baby used to like gnawing at the rings or sleeping against them. <strong>Currently, they have a 40% off sale too (Code: NovaScotia)</strong>, so it could be anywhere from $4.2 – $6 for a pair! I found the large rings made the Stilfull fabric easier to adjust, but also less grippy, so a pair of medium rings would probably work better once you’re used to how it feels.]]>

		<p>				Wish for you.
I came across the Wish site and app through a Facebook advertisement, and was intrigued because the products were similar to what the co-op groups were selling (often from China) and at much lower prices.  So, I googled. Reviews were mixed, with many poor ratings from consumers, but <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/ryanmac/2016/12/07/wish-ceo-compares-shopping-apps-success-to-donald-trumps-victory-confirms-500-million-investment/#4546098793b3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">write-ups on tech</a> and <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/ryanmac/2016/12/07/wish-ceo-compares-shopping-apps-success-to-donald-trumps-victory-confirms-500-million-investment/#4546098793b3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">business sites</a> and <a href="https://www.therecord.com/news-story/7108343-six-uw-grads-have-founded-firms-worth-more-than-1-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mentions in local sites</a> / <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/stories/waterloo-math-alumnus-named-forbes-top-40-under-40" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">UW</a> seemed to be positive in terms of its success and business model. I gave it a chance though because I ended up finding out that the cofounder and co-CEO was a former colleague/MSN Messenger friend from my UW language lab days, with whom I eventually lost touch with after he moved to Toronto[ref]…because how many “Danny Zhang”s are there in the world, and what are the chances? turns out it was the one I knew[/ref] – I attribute my impulse buy of Yahoo! stocks to his indirect influence (which ended up tanking and then only finally evened out a couple years ago, at which point we promptly sold it) ← this is to say that I trust-ed him. He’s a super smart/hardworking guy, so I was super excited to learn about this (ad)venture!

</p><ol><li>Refund policy on goods that do not arrive by the promised date. I just learned that <a href="http://bc.ctvnews.ca/delivery-delays-online-customers-waiting-months-for-orders-from-china-1.3441778" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">packages tend to take forever to clear customs in Canada</a> in general and not necessarily because of Wish itself, so it often doesn’t get delivered until past the expected date – one of my first packages was delivered within a month to Kitchener, but it stayed in some facility for two months, and then only came after I got my refund. You do need to stay on top of it and open a support ticket to request a refund though. I have received 6 out of 18 items so far before the expected arrival date; the rest have been refunded – some of which have since arrived while the rest are still missing or in limbo / la-la-land somewhere. My theory is that their algorithm will self-adjust based on when you tell them that you’ve received an item (after the expected arrival time has passed, it will ask you if you have received it and if so, when), so that eventually, they will estimate a more accurate (and likely more lengthy) shipping time so you don’t keep getting free goods.</li>


    

<li>Additional discounts  – it uses the psychology of limited time offers (and limited quantity offers) to persuade you to buy something. For example:


<ul><li>Group buy pricing – cheaper if you buy with someone, or if someone buys with you, you get a rebate to be used on your next purchase (by a certain time)</li>


    

<li>Instant offers – cheaper by a very small amount if you buy it within a set time</li>


    

<li>Promotional pricing – the more you buy and the more you review, the more points you get towards leveling up. Every time you level up, you get a discount – which expires after a certain time</li>


    

<li>Cart savings. <strong>Pro-tip:</strong> if you do not need to buy something right away and there is no timed discount offered, leave it in your cart and keep going to your cart and leaving your cart. Some time later, you will be offered an extra 5% off if you buy it right away</li>


    

<li>Spinning the daily discount wheel – it seems to be based on items you have viewed or have in your cart, discounted for 10 minutes</li>


</ul></li>


</ol>


What do you need to watch for?


<ol><li>Don’t buy anything you need if you need it by a certain time; if history is a good predictor, it can and will take months – see first point in the section above.</li>


    

<li>Look at the price – many times, it advertises “up to” a certain % off (either 50% if a referral, or 20%), but I haven’t actually gotten anything more than 5% off, and I’m not even sure how to get it up to the advertised discount. Don’t trust the regular prices – they’re over-inflated, and research your prices before buying even with the discounts; sometimes, you can get it locally or elsewhere for about the same price or even lower. And click on the Related section/tab to see if other stores with similar ratings sell it for a lower price. Remember, Wish is not a single store, so if you’re reading negative comments about products from the Wish site, you need to remember that it’s likely dependent on the reseller / shop and not Wish itself (similar to Aliexpress, eBay, Amazon).</li>


    

<li>Reviews. My own rule is to read each product’s reviews and only buy something that is 4 stars or more with the more ratings the better (ie. 100+), unless you are willing to take the risk and throw that money away should it not meet your expectations. You need to pay for shipping if you send back an item, so most often than not, it’s not worth it, so I don’t buy big-ticket items.</li>


    

<li>It’s hard to track down a specific item, unless you know how to search for it; if you are just browsing, it’s a better shopping experience</li>


    

<li>Clothing sizing is often in Asian sizing. I’m Asian, so next time I might just go with that because <a href="https://www.wish.com/c/557a85dc8b8cb34ac6ebd5c0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a L dress ended up too big</a> in the bust area despite reviews saying it’s really small (I’m a US XS, so I’m probably 2 sizes up as opposed to 3). I’ve been trying to avoid buying adult clothing just because you can’t try it on first, but I find children’s clothing to be easier to buy as I can always buy larger and hope they will grow into – that and the price point for children’s clothing is generally lower.</li>


    

<li>Know that most products are made in China; they may not be the best quality, and you may be getting a product that is like its brand-name counterpart (or counterfeit – some product rating comments will say that despite the advertised brand, it’s not the quality they expect from that brand).</li>


    

<li>Support, other than on shipping, seems to be miserable – you get a different rep at each interaction and the reps sound like they follow a script so response is slow and frustrating. Case in point: I tried to get technical support because the app said I had a discount that would be automatically applied before a certain date, but I tried adding items to my cart and the discount wasn’t being applied. I did get an email reminder saying that the promo would expire in a few days (before the posted date) so I asked them to send my feedback to the technical team; the Zendesk Help thread is still ongoing.</li>


    

<li>Wish is not just one app / site – they have a few others focusing on different offerings: geek, home, mama are a few of the segmented branches. However, the user experience is a very disconnected, lacking SSO (single sign on) which means you need to create a separate account for each one and your point and level history starts at 0, despite it selling the same items at the same prices – for the most part. I have noticed that the separate apps tend to be more experimental first (A/B testing?) – for example, all items used to have a base cost, with shipping to Canada about $2-$3 for a small package. However, in the separate apps one day, I noticed the same item had $0 cost but the shipping went up by $1-$2; the final total was either the same, or cheaper by $1, so I ordered through the separate app. A few days later, this model was applied on the main site / app (for marketing effectiveness, it does seem that the “you just need to pay shipping” model is more enticing than a product that costs money with a lower shipping cost). So my<strong> pro-tip</strong> advice, is that you can look on the other more focused apps / sites if you’d like, but use the main Wish app / site to buy so you can keep your points in one place (for faster discounts), and you can keep a track of your purchases all in one place.</li>


</ol>


If by now you are as curious as I was about this Wish site, and you haven’t signed up, download the Wish app (on phone, don’t sign up via desktop browser), use promo code <em>dpvwsfd</em> to save <em>up to </em>50% off your first purchase – do let me know if you actually save 50% , because I’m thinking you’ll save at most 5%.]]>

		<p>				his peanut and dairy allergy, so here’s our first update and a few lessons I’ve learned:


</p><ul><li>The allergist called me one Saturday afternoon, which surprised me as I thought doctors don’t work on weekends?  He told that the blood results for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioallergosorbent_test" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the RAST test</a> came back: DS would likely have a 50% chance of an anaphylactic reaction to milk, and a 90% chance of peanuts. So nope, not qualified to take the peanut challenge at this time.</li>


    

<li>He appears to be allergic to other tree nuts, but I’m not sure which one. How do I know? I fed him a mixed nut butter from Trader Joe’s which has the following ingredients: Almonds, Cashew Nuts, Walnuts, Brazil Nuts, Hazelnuts, Pecans, Sea Salt; he didn’t react the first time. The second time? Instant hives, which only went away after two doses of Benadryl. Our next appointment is not until the middle of summer, but at that appointment, we can test for further food allergies like goat’s milk protein, and the nuts, though I suspect it might be walnuts as it seems that it coincides with peanut allergies; he’s had almond milk before without any reaction, as well as almond in Chinese soup.</li>


    

<li>And as mom and son are refraining from nuts and dairy, I have noticed that Bean has asked for dairy items less – she wants his soy milk, and doesn’t ask for cheese, milk, or yogurt nearly as often as before</li>


    

<li>And as a mom refraining from nuts and dairy, I have failed him at least once – which I feel incredibly bad about.  As my body can’t tell if I’ve ingested dairy or nuts, it’s only when he reacts that I’ve known that I had something I shouldn’t have had – specifically, the time when a friend made a special bowl of pasta for me knowing that I couldn’t have garlic or onions, but she had forgotten I wasn’t able to have cheese. I didn’t want to refuse it, so we decided to scrape off the top of it with the melted cheese and I would eat the rest of it. Bad idea. Within 30 minutes of breastfeeding, he threw up. Lesson learned: learn to get over feeling bad for inconveniencing people</li>


    

<li>Another lesson learned: Be skeptical. When someone tells you that a batch of homemade goodies they received from someone else are said to be safe, but it actually wasn’t, you learn that it’s okay not to trust what people tell you.</li>


    

<li>And, if anyone tells you that there is no such thing as dairy-free chocolate (as I’ve been told), it’s a myth; you can find dark chocolate / cocoa without milk, although many varieties <a href="https://www.fda.gov/ForConsumers/ConsumerUpdates/ucm433555.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">might come with a risk</a>.</li>


</ul><h3>Dairy alternatives</h3>


Unfortunately, I’ve noticed that I tend to crave for more sweets because I can’t readily have them anymore, so in my quest to search for sweets and treats that I can have, I’ve come to realize a few things:


<ul><li>Many products that are nut and dairy-free tend to be vegan and gluten-free. I guess, it’s a better cost-benefit to sell a product that meets multiple-dietary needs than just one or two.</li>


    

<li>Be willing to pay a premium for anything that isn’t mainstream; this is true of organic products, and any specialty products like these</li>


    

<li>While I initially enthusiastically tried some dairy-free alternatives, I now am wary of trying most of them as I’ve only found one or two that didn’t have a strange texture or aftertaste:


<ul><li>The <a href="http://sodeliciousdairyfree.com/products/almond-milk-frozen-desserts/mocha-almond-fudge-bars" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mocha almond fudge</a> “ice-cream” bar by So Delicious is surprisingly good, President’s Choice coconut milk-based “ice cream” in chocolate and mango is good and affordable; I have yet to try coconut; and, Belasoy dark chocolate pudding is tasty too!</li>


    

<li>Soy yogurt, coconut yogurt, almond milk yogurt – strange texture and aftertaste, and unusually sweet if fruit flavoured 🙁</li>


    

<li>Fake cheese, either blocks, shredded, or sliced – they tend to be okay together with something like melted on top of a burger, but terrible on its own or where it’s highlighted, like on nachos; I wouldn’t buy it again</li>


    

<li>I had forgotten that <a href="http://blog.fatfreevegan.com/2011/10/what-the-heck-is-nutritional-yeast.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">nutritional yeast</a> can be an interesting alternative to make popcorn taste cheesy</li>


    

<li>The most surprising finds yet:


<ul><li>while Oreo and Pillsbury croissants <em>are</em> dairy-free,</li>


    

<li>many types of margarine are <strong><em>not</em></strong> dairy-free; the ones that are contain artificial flavours, colour and other strange additives – the <a href="http://www.becel.ca/en/becel/becelproducts/becel-vegan.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">vegan one by Becel</a> is the one I ended up buying and using for baking, but I prefer using coconut oil on my toast now over margarine</li>


</ul></li>


    

<li>My favourite stores? Organic Garage in Thornhill, for their discount breads and discount milk alternatives when they’re close to expiry; and locally, <a href="http://www.cefoodexperience.ca/?page_id=29" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ce Food Experience and Bakery</a> where I encountered the most wonderful nut-free, dairy-free apple pie; her partner has multiple allergies, so they have a selection of safe treats to choose from, and <a href="http://www.sevenshores.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Seven Shores</a> for their vegan menu options (including vegan cheese and ease of subbing avocado for mayo for example) and baked treats (sometimes $1 day-olds).</li>


</ul></li>


</ul><h3>The UX of Labels</h3>


I’m used to reading labels to see if a product has garlic, onion, etc. and how high and the sodium content on the nutritional value chart, but when I’m specifically looking for allergens, it’s so much easier when companies decide to highlight them. Here are a few design choices that I’ve encountered:


<h4><a href="https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipOnzRsfAoOR8UgSfTQi-pwSnOOWUISg8KMmJg3dBG8A81LetmyqRGJ8FMXxLn6hIg/photo/AF1QipMJLWyIgFXDJTyM-ZHC7EL2D1Let9wI-joN4im3?key=c19hQmJWSlZhdXRENGdpWnU4d1lhRXBXOURVWG1n"><img class="alignright wp-image-5682 size-medium" src="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/PHOTO_20170508_092246-300x169.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="169" srcset="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/PHOTO_20170508_092246-300x169.jpg 300w,https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/PHOTO_20170508_092246-768x432.jpg 768w,https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/PHOTO_20170508_092246-1024x576.jpg 1024w,https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/PHOTO_20170508_092246.jpg 1258w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></a>Identifying the common allergen(s) in the product</h4>

I have a love-hate relationship with the disclaimer on a product that tells me that it <em>may</em> contain an ingredient that isn’t listed, or that it’s processed in a facility or shared-equipment that uses those ingredients. This information is not regulated, and instead seems to be <a href="http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/fn-an/label-etiquet/allergen/precaution_label-etiquette-eng.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">volunteered information</a> – aimed to help consumers (but allows companies to cover their butts I’d say); it’s definitely important to know that a certain product may have been in contact with an allergen, but this information becomes useless in situations where the label isn’t helpful anymore.
It does help when the labels tell me to consult the website for more information, or straight up <a href="http://sodeliciousdairyfree.com/allergen-information" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tells me what they do</a> on the label to make sure that there isn’t any cross contamination. If it’s made in-store, I often find that if I talk to the department in-person or call them, I can decide if I’m comfortable with their methods of cleaning, etc. I have come to trust[ref]perhaps foolishly especially knowing that this label is volunteered info[/ref] that if a certain brand of food always uses the “may contain” label, if this is absent in a product, I take to mean that there are no known possible contaminants.
But, two labels come to mind that have thrown me in for a loop:


<ul><li>This box of cookies that have a giant list of allergens that they’re free from, yet down below in smaller print, it says: “Made in a facility that uses dairy” so now, a little doubt creeps in over the credibility of the “dairy-free” claim.</li>


    

<li>Costco’s rotisserie chicken’s label tells me that it may contain ALL of the top allergens it seems: wheat, fish, milk, eggs, soy, shellfish, crustaceans, tree nuts, sesame, mustard. REALLY? So, I called our local Costco, and spoke to someone from the meat department who prepares these chickens, and he told me that they prepare the chicken in the raw meat room, so the only risk would be fish (shellfish, crustaceans, etc.). <em>Thank you</em>. I guess you can say everything that isn’t packaged in the store might be cross contaminated if they prepare food in an open bakery, but I don’t see bags of apples with those labels…</li>


</ul>

		<p>				born at home.
A couple of evenings ago, our little one had a <a href="http://kidshealth.org/en/parents/febrile.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">febrile seizure</a>. I didn’t know that was the name of it at the time, but I had two fleeting thoughts: – what was it that I read about seizures in young children during illness – was this it or something else? and – I hope I don’t have to ask for our hand-me-down baby clothes back. During the episode, I felt so helpless watching his limbs twitch, his eyes roll back repeatedly, and his lips turn blue. Shortly after we laid him down on the floor, during the call with dispatch, the seizure stopped but his eyes looked glassy, his gaze off in the distance; he fell asleep despite us talking to him and he didn’t even notice his sister jumping to get his attention. I cheered inside every time his chest rose up and then down, confirming that he was still breathing.
And for those wondering:


</p><h3>What was the ambulance ride like?</h3>


The inside of an ambulance is surprisingly spacious, with ample room to seat at least 5 passengers with seat belts, and there’s a <a href="http://www.fernoems.com/en/search-results/pedi-mate.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">child-restraint system</a> for ambulance cots! Though, with rather limited windows and with the small view whizzing by when I tried to look out to see whether we were, I found myself getting a bit motion sick. We were the first call on their shift. As the ambulance door closed, I could only offer a weak smile to the neighbour who walked out to see what was going on (I found out later, they asked j.w if everything was okay and invited them over and offered to babysit if needed). If the $45 ambulance bill is not covered by OHIP or extended health, it’s a fairly reasonable cost: $755 cheaper than having a fire truck come on scene, and $35 cheaper than for one in our area in BC.


<h3>What happened at the hospital?</h3>


We were placed in our own room with a bed to rest on in the acute care department of the emergency ward  – I guess that’s one advantage of arriving via ambulance: <a href="http://www.grhosp.on.ca/care/services-departments/emergency/current-emergency-wait" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">you don’t have to sit in the waiting area</a> and deal with triage directly. His temperature was noted at 38.8C (which isn’t the highest it’s been). One of the paramedics instructed me to put him on the bed and wanted me to stand or sit in the chair, but thankfully, the nurses let me pick him up, which calmed him down (and kept him from falling off the bed!). For the most part, he wasn’t too miserable – I mean, you’d feel uncomfortable and probably want to cry too if they poked you, put you in some confining <a href="http://www.piggostat.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">x-ray contraption</a>, and put a catheter in you. The blood work showed low bicarbonate which may be related to his crazy 💩 episodes in the past couple of days (diarrhea, the doctor thinks), and chest X-rays suggest something viral in the chest, possibly early pneumonia, which might have been from his cold a couple weeks back and could explain the wet cough they overheard. The doctor consulted the pediatrician and decided that no antibiotics were needed at this time since he’s still himself, for the most part anyway (thankfully because antibiotics can cause a bunch of side effects including yeast infection in the diaper area – but I’ve supplemented with probiotics anyway since he had diarrhea). Pee dip test came out clear. Overall, we had a nice mother-son bonding time once I was given the okay to pick him up and hold him.
Despite us having to wait 5 hours for tests and results to come back, and with little updates unless I asked, towards the end of the evening, a nurse held my son while she faced the other way in the washroom so I could relieve my relatively full bladder, and even gave me a sandwich, some juice, and some fruit for us to eat, when I asked where I could buy some food to fill our rather empty stomachs (the little guy promptly fell asleep once he satisfied his hunger)[ref]this episode happened just as we were sitting down to eat dinner so we missed it[/ref].
Towards the later parts of the evening, one distressed and very vocal fellow ended up in the same ward as us. One of the nurses told me that on weekends/Saturdays especially, and during later parts of the night, they often see people who don’t know where they are, or are elsewhere mentally because they’re either drunk or on way too much drugs, and sadly, the many of the latter are young people.
PT took us home as it was late by the time we left and j.w had stayed home with Bean. Since then, DS has symptoms of a cold in addition to the fever, which comes and goes.
Overall, I am very pleased with the response rate and care that we received the other night by Grand River hospital and by the paramedics.


<h3>What are we to watch for now?</h3>


The doctor instructed me to bring him back if he had another seizure within 24 hours, if we see him have any difficulty breathing, or if the fever doesn’t dissipate within 5 days. I was also advised to make a follow-up appointment with our family doctor the next week. If we notice less wet diapers, she suggested 1:1 apple juice to water ratio as a cheaper and tastier but equally effective alternative to pedialyte.


<h3>Will it happen again? Does it affect their development? Will they get epilepsy?</h3>


Sadly, the chances of another febrile seizure happening in the future is 1 in 3 (33%) now that he has had one. Both the internet and the doctor tells me that it’s fairly common in young children in response to a fever past 38C and it doesn’t seem to harm them. Our relatively laid-back child now has both allergy and febrile seizure risks (to balance out his easy-going nature?).  His chance of developing epilepsy according to the doctor is double, moving from 1% to 2%, which is still quite low: it won’t happen 98% of the time.


<h3>What happened before all this started?</h3>


Before the seizure, he seemed like his usual self, though he has seemed sad after every time he soiled his diaper for the past day or so (every one was was poopy) especially when I asked him about it, and he vomited once while crying on the toilet (I thought it was from crying, not from being sick). He hadn’t quite shaken his cough from a couple weeks back, but it didn’t seem to bother him and it was only on occasion, so I thought it was just residual coughing. He was maybe a touch warmer than usual, but I’m usually able to tell if he has a fever just by feel, so I’m not sure why I didn’t notice it; it probably didn’t help that he was wearing a wool cardigan. He woke up from his late nap after being transferred to j.w so I could make dinner, and shortly after j.w put him in the high chair, I heard, “I think he’s having a seizure”. I suggested moving him onto the ground (which the doctor assured me that was the right thing to do), called 911 since it was his first time and we weren’t sure what to do – I figured I could use the verbal coaching if I needed to do infant/baby/child CPR. He definitely felt and looked a lot hotter by the time the seizure stopped and woke up crying.


<h3>What to expect if it happens again in your care?</h3>


Start timing it – it’s probably going to feel longer than how much time has actually passed. Falling asleep is normal as long as breathing is happening, and as long as he is responsive and “comes out of it” within an hour of happening, it’s really nothing to be concerned about[ref]I’m sure I’m going to be concerned every time it happens anyway[/ref]. Put him down on the floor and turn his head to side in case he vomits. If the seizure continues for more than 4 minutes, call 911. If it doesn’t last for more than 10 minutes, we don’t need to bring him in to be assessed but since it takes a few minutes for the ambulance to come, preemptively calling them after 4 minutes is okay.  Paramedics advised us to strip him down to diaper to bring down his temperature as well. The pamphlet the hospital gave us also told us not to put him in a bath to bring down his temperature and don’t put anything in their mouths; they will not swallow their tongue. If he’s feverish, give him the correct dosage of Tylenol / Advil to avoid peaking over 38C.


<h3>P.S. As usual, God’s fingerprint was all over this.</h3>


He prepared me for this in two ways:


<ol><li>I was supposed to be out that evening watching a movie with a friend but because I forgot to arrange the logistics with j.w (dinner, rides, car, etc.) and because the kids were still napping past the time, I missed it.</li>


    

<li>I have been on a long wait list for a LTE WiFi hotspot router from the library. My hold finally came up the day before this happened and j.w managed to pick it up for me. I was thinking, “I’m not going anywhere this week, why would I need internet on the go?” Well, he thought to throw it into my hospital bag as I was rushing out, and thankfully I had it because I wouldn’t have paid $10 for internet for the 5 hours that we were there. It enabled me to keep family and friends up-to-date, and I was encouraged to learn that so many were praying for us – and asking if we needed any help! Thank you, as always 🙂</li>


</ol>


I pray we won’t experience this again, but if it does happen, at least I know what to expect -sort of; I feel one can never be “ready enough” to get married, to get pregnant, to have kids, and now to parent, but I know I’m never alone in this journey.]]>

</p><li>he prefers soft veggies like squashes over green leafy vegetables (too stringy / fibrous), all soft meat – chicken, pork, but not steak, fish, and almost all fruits, especially oranges[ref]portion-wise, he eats the same amount as his sister now, if not more![/ref]</li>


    

<li>looking at the world upside down</li>


    

<li>studying younger babies</li>


    

<li>shrieking in laughter, especially when his sister eggs him on</li>


    

<li>plunking at keys (computer and piano keyboards)</li>


    

<li>building with Lego and cars (more so than his sister did, but maybe because his sister is more interested in them now)</li>


    

<li>looking at pictures in books, especially when on the toilet (he asks for them by pointing to where they are stored)</li>


    

<li>sneaking up the stairs (while we were unaware), climbing and standing on chairs (probably seeing his sister do that) – he’s definitely less cautious than his sister – maybe a combination of being a boy, a second-child, and his own personality differences</li>


    

<li>helping mommy unload the dishwasher – cutlery is his forte, though sometimes he will “help” unload his cup by doing quality control on it first and pretending to drink from it</li>


    

<li>playing with water, especially when washing his hands</li>


    

<li>toddling around (now that he’s walking around with a lot more confidence)</li>





Month 14 and 15 seemed pretty significant:


<ul><li>he took his first unassisted steps at around the 14 month mark (2 months sooner than his sister)</li>


    

<li>2 week long cold/flu, where he spat up a couple of times, but it coincided when our house was sick last year as well</li>


    

<li>at his check-up, he weighed in as being on the 25th percentile (5x his sister!), around 50th percent in height, but 70th in head circumference (<em>not my genes!</em>); the doctor did comment that they are actually more interested in head circumference than length since a spike in the head size curve could mean a tumor or something unusual in there</li>


    

<li>figuring out how to drink properly from a sippy cup (and turning it over and tapping liquid from the unsealed ones all over the tray)</li>


    

<li>“painting”[ref]using a brush and water to bring color in a magic book[/ref] for the first time</li>


    

<li>mommy feeding him mixed nut butter (no peanuts) with no reaction the first time, but breaking out in hives and redness that required two doses of Benadryl to calm it down – <em>sigh</em>, more allergens to watch out for.</li>


</ul>


The doctor says that he’s supposed to say about 20 words by now, but while he’s not there yet (probably 3-4 words he says independently), his vocabulary seems to have exploded over the past two months. Resignedly, many of them are in English (sigh) as he’s picking up what his sister often says:


<ul><li>babbling, with first words at 14 months that seem to be associated with a meaning, but often copied instead of independently said, like “bao bao” (bread, but I realize that his meaning actually encompasses all food), “wow”, “POP” (goes the weasel), <em>mum mum</em> (food, not me) and now it extends to ow, snack, <em>woh woh </em>(dog), <em>mao mao </em>(cat)</li>


    

<li>signing more (food) by tapping all his fingers together, like in a teepee</li>


    

<li><em>nein nein</em>: wants mommy’s milk (that’s how he greets me now too, not mama – I’ve been reduced to breastmilk, sigh)</li>


    

<li><em>ma ma</em> (paternal grandmother) (15 months) paired with <em>yeh yeh</em> (paternal grandfather), which he had started calling long before <em>ma ma</em></li>


    

<li>using certain actions for certain songs, at certain parts of songs (like lifting his arms “when they’re up they’re up” for Grand Ol’ Duke of York)</li>


    

<li>plays word games by repeating after you like counting from 1-5, but only saying 1 or 5 repeatedly: him: <em>YUT, </em>me: <em>yee, sam, say, </em>him: <em>NG; </em>sometimes he just says 5 or 1 before we even get there</li>


    

<li>he also understands what you say, like go get the ball, but even when you’re not talking to him (such as if I said to his sister, go wash your hands, he suddenly decides he wants to be done with his meal too, or I talk about shoes and he goes and grabs some)</li>


</ul>

I had the opportunity to attend <a href="http://www.blnd.ca/#schedule" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BLND</a>, this one-day, full-day UX event (conference) that was entirely <em>free</em> (even the food was free, and the optional bus from/to UW)! By the end of it, I went home impressed at the quality of the talks, the workshops, and the flow of how they managed to jam-pack a day’s worth of material. This was also the first event where I felt that there was a good mix of community professionals and students, and  got to hear from various people on how they got onto the UX path. I’ve come to conclude that no one journey is the same, and reflecting back, mine seems just as accidental[ref]but we all know that nothing in life is accidental, and I don’t believe in coincidences[/ref] as the many who shared their stories[ref]My story? Two English courses in my program piqued my interest, then interactions with those at work, options to either go UX or PM route, and then to research or design route[/ref]. Though, the path can be so much more directed as a student these days, as there are a multitude of programs in this field!
The workshop I chose to attend covered many tips that would have been quite useful in the large corporate environment where I spent a number of years at as a UX person[ref]at a time where UX roles were relatively new and where job titles weren’t standard across the company or industry convention, so getting HR to recognize that what I did was on par with other peers in the org was only possible with a supportive manager[/ref], and it was a great complement to the keynote talk which reminded us to embrace “the villains” (the naysayers or skeptics). I’m jotting down the condensed / key notes here as I promised to exchange notes with those who went to the others.


</p><h2>The Art of Stakeholdering</h2>

Google found me <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/SDNCanada/a-crash-course-in-the-art-of-stakeholdering-patrick-bach-chelsea-omel-markus-grupp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the slides</a>!

Guess it’s no surprise that one of the planners of the SDNCanada event was the event organizer for BLND[/ref]
<strong>Stakeholder:</strong> one who has a stake in the enterprise, and involved in or affected by a course of action, who is going to be impacted by what you’re putting out. The majority of people will not be the perfect stakeholder.
Always remember: it’s a two-way relationship.

<li><strong>skeptic</strong> – low belief, high in understanding; may become an obstacle or distraction, being a disruption in meetings, and might even rub off on others and lower the energy</li>

		<p>				uxWaterloo is a local group that meets regularly with folks interested in the user experience of products and services. This month, James Wu, a UI Architect, spoke at the meeting about design considerations for mobile experiences. This event particularly interested me, not only because of the topic, but particularly also because the guest speaker is from Kobo, a Canadian (at the time) e-book company (that integrates with Pocket, so you can download and read everything you’ve saved online offline and without the ads!).
Like many, I have traditionally focused more on web desktop experiences, but I have on occasion needed to design for a mobile experience as well. James eloquently summed up the challenges I have often come across when transitioning to the mobile space, and reminded me of others that aren’t always thought of, such as:


</p><h2>Screen Real Estate</h2>




<ul><li><strong>Screen size</strong> (diagonal space)
For example, a 29″ desktop monitor could be 300-500% bigger than a mobile phone</li>


    

<li><strong>Orientation</strong> – the changes from portrait and landscape (and vice versa)
What’s interesting is that during their user research with 1024×600 tablets (such as the Samsung tablet), they observed that users prefered using this size of tablets in landscape format</li>


    

<li><strong>Screen resolution</strong>
Using the same 1024×600 example, you would either have your screen in “short and wide” format, or “narrow and long”</li>


    

<li><strong>On screen keyboard</strong>
On many touch devices, more than 1/2 the screen is taken up by the keyboard, which would cover anything underneath it</li>


    

<li><strong>Platform variations</strong> (or device / hardware variations)
The takeaway? Design for different experiences/products; don’t cram everything into one screen if it’s not necessary. Why? “Don’t necessarily think people use their phones the same way as tablets [desktops, etc.].” James said that at Kobo, they must design knowing that people will have multiple devices; the experience should be consistent across them, but not [necessarily] identical.</li>


</ul><h2>Hardware</h2>


Like desktop computers, hardware varies across different models. For the mobile devices, things like processor and memory are important to consider as it could affect battery life, performance, and even result in side effects like heat. Others include:


<ul><li><strong>Removable storage:</strong> the ability to “hot swap” a media card while the application is running in either the background or the foreground could cause undesired effects if designed improperly</li>


    

<li><strong>Interaction mechanisms:</strong> these may effect how a user interacts with an application such as trackballs, trackpads, keyboards, gesture strips (like the Palm Pre)</li>


</ul><strong>Gestures</strong>
For touch devices, we get into the a realm that is still pretty new. There is not yet official standards for touch gestures and there is limited documentation to illustrate them (James suggested that Apple may currently have the leading edge).


<ul><li><strong>Core/standard gestures</strong> like tap, swipe, pinch, expand, drag
For example, a more common gesture is the Pinch-Zoom to adjust the font size of Apple devices</li>


    

<li><strong>Peripheral gestures</strong> may include less familiar gestures such as long press, rotate, shake, sequences
Using Apple again for this example, a less common might be shaking the iPhone to perform the undo action</li>


</ul>


When designing for touch, one must consider gestures could be used in different directions and even with multiple fingers. It isn’t surprising that some devices even recognize simultaneous touches (imagine designing a piano keyboard app so that multiple keys could be played at once to create a chord).
It’s also important to provide users with affordances that let them know that features are there, and that they will use. Kobo uses instructional overlays for first-time use, as well as ghosted elements. I tried to imagine what a “ghosted element” was based on James’ description and thought of the many mobile games where they use these visual cues to indicate the controls (where to tap on the screen) as a part of the onboarding experience.
Kobo may also add advanced gestures for more advanced users (like a keyboard shortcut on the desktop), such as adding an element of fun by adding a gestural easter egg in the Kobo app.


<h2>User Context</h2>


We must remember that users are likely in different environments and may have more constraints than if they’re sitting in front of a desktop. Considerations include:


<ul><li><strong>Mobility:</strong> device may not be plugged in (may impact battery life for example)</li>


    

<li><strong>Divided attention:</strong> users could be multi-tasking or looking at the device on the go
[e.g. using their devices while walking from the train platform to catch the connecting train]</li>


    

<li><strong>Unpredictable surroundings:</strong> things like flakey connections [e.g. online then loses reception while train goes under the tunnel] could impact a download or chat experience</li>


    

<li><strong>Cost:</strong> How much would it cost by running your application? Unfortunately, not everyone has unlimited data. Some customers pay per byte, and that might mean customizing for wifi vs. data</li>


    

<li><strong>Others:</strong> the amount of light (dark environment) or even the number of free hands could impact how they interact with the device.</li>


</ul>


I’ve observed commuters carrying a briefcase in one hand, newspapers in another, and managed to hold a cup a coffee, along with their device. In that case, could they still perform a multi-touch gesture, and would they still be able to navigate even if they couldn’t?
Knowing what users are doing while they’re using your product is a good advantage. Lesson from Kobo: James told us of a time when they hid the notification bar, including the time, to minimize distractions while the user was reading. Yet, it didn’t occur to them that if a customer didn’t have a watch or an easy way to check for time, they had to exit out of the application. Now, the notification bar can be brought back with a gesture.


<h2>Standards and Expectations</h2>


Customers might expect applications to be specific to their product. When Kobo designed an app that looked like it was for Apple device, Android customers weren’t happy. But once they took away the “Apple” button and changed the color, they noticed a decrease in complaints about the look of their application.
So when designing for a mobile experience…
…these are just some considerations and potential challenges that may come up while designing for a mobile product. Others are shared across the desktop too. We can’t forget who we’re designing for, the primary user for your product. For Kobo [at the time], it’s for women in the mid 30-40s, simply because they found that they spent the most money. Who knows, you might even need to take accessibility concerns as a requirement, simply because it’s the law.]]>

		<p>				presentation on mobile design by Luke Wroblewski on the web. I often reference his book <a href="http://rosenfeldmedia.com/books/webforms/info/table_of_contents/"><em>Web Form Design</em></a><em> </em>in my library when designing and reviewing web forms in many of our web applications.
In the presentation, he covered many mobile design considerations, some of which are will be covered in a future post. Here are some specifics:


</p><h2><strong>Touch Targets</strong></h2>


This is the area where your thumbs or fingers may overlap beyond the target button or control. Some recommendations:


<ul><li><strong>minimum target size:</strong> 29px wide/44px tall (Apple)</li>


    

<li><strong>recommended touch target size:</strong> 9mm/34px (Windows Phone)</li>


    

<li><strong>minimum touch target size:</strong> 7mm/26px (Windows Phone)</li>


</ul><h2><strong>Touch Gestures</strong></h2>


After going through some phone platforms that support multi-touch such as iPhone, Android, Windows, and BlackBerry 6, he groups these as being the common core basic gestures among them:


<ul><li><strong>Tap:</strong> briefly touch surface with fingertip(s)</li>


    

<li><strong>Double tap:</strong> rapidly touch surface twice with fingertip</li>


    

<li><strong>Drag:</strong> move fingertip(s) over surface without losing contact</li>


    

<li><strong>Flick:</strong> quickly brush surface with fingertip</li>


    

<li><strong>Pinch:</strong> touch surface with two fingers and bring them close together</li>


    

<li><strong>Spread:</strong> touch surface with two (or all) fingers and move them apart</li>


    

<li><strong>Press:</strong> touch surface for an extended period of time</li>


    

<li><strong>Press & tap:</strong> touch surface with one finger and briefly touch surface with a second finger</li>


    

<li><strong>Press & drag:</strong> touch surface with one finger and move second finger over surface without losing contact (using one or both hands)</li>


    

<li><strong>Rotate:</strong> touch surface with two fingers (using one or both hands) and move them in a clockwise or counterclockwise direction</li>


</ul><h2><strong>Common system actions</strong></h2>




<ul><li><strong>Change mode:</strong> press</li>


    

<li><strong>Open:</strong> double tap</li>


    

<li><strong>Select:</strong> tap</li>


    

<li><strong>Delete:</strong> drag (across item or off-screen)</li>


    

<li><strong>Duplicate:</strong> tap (source and destination) – touch object, then touch elsewhere on surface</li>


    

<li><strong>Move:</strong> drag (and drop) or multi-finger drag – move one or two to five fingertips over surface without losing contact</li>


    

<li><strong>Pan:</strong> drag hand –  move fingers and palm of one hand over surface without losing contact</li>


    

<li><strong>Scroll:</strong> drag (one or two fingers): move fingertip over scrollbar without losing contact, move two fingers up/down across surface, or touch scrollbar for extended period of time</li>


    

<li><strong>Scroll fast:</strong> flick – quickly brush surface with fingertip in the direction you want to scroll</li>


</ul>


LukeW refers to the more complex gestures, that may be unique to specific platforms, as compound or specialized touch gestures.


<h2><strong>Hover</strong></h2>


In this new touch world, you can’t rely on the “hover” action anymore (“at least not yet,” he says), and it’s left up to the designers to find something appropriate in its place – which I agree with him, hover isn’t an intentional action; people find information in the hover bubbles accidentally. And yes, there does seem to be a fine line between hover and tooltips.
LukeW’s advice? Design for mobile first. If you design for a desktop web browser, you may not think of things like the orientation, location input that could impact the UI. From another angle, one could argue that  it’s probably easier to build it a more complex system (mobile) and remove the unnecessary features (desktop) than vice versa.
