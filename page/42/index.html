A new visit in my area:





<b>Restaurant</b><br>
A friend wanted some cake so originally it was between Yukiko’s Cafe or Sobey’s. I then remembered the reviews for Cafe Bon Choix, a little tiny shop that I’ve been to for breakfast that seem to have fairly good reviews for dessert. We’ve had our breakfasts at work catered by them, and I can’t get enough of their cinnamon buns. Because we didn’t have dinner yet, we decided to enjoy a meal coupled with dessert. The decor resembles a simple soup and sandwich and catering shop (the type that our family owned), and because it seems to be connected to offices in an office building, they had a couple of small business parties. It won some reader’s choice recognition for the local paper (The Record) for 2005.





<b>Meal Choice</b><br>
I decided to try their savoury crepes to see how they would compare to the crepe place at Waterloo Town Square and at a small place in the Distillery District in Toronto. The ham and cheese melt with mushroom sauce for $7.25 came with a choice of soup du jour, garden salad (with choice of dressing) or fries. My friend had never heard of savoury crepes before, so maybe it’s just another fusion idea. She had a peppercorn steak for around $14 which came with stirfry veggies, rice and a choice of side as well.





For dessert, we both had a slice of cake ($4.50) – mine was the brownie bottom, chocolate mousse and another layer of chocolate (cheesecake?) while hers was a oreo cookie bottom with white chocolate cheesecake and strawberry puree in the center. The price of a slice of dessert compared to Yukiko’s is much more reasonable (it’s close to $7 at Yukiko’s but I think theirs is a slightly bigger portion and have more selection to choose from).





<b>Food Presentation and Quality</b><br>
The soup du jour was cream of chicken, which didn’t sound too appealing so I chose the garden salad with the mandarin-kiwi vingarette dressing. The salad was a good size, but I was disappointed to find the red cabbage on it (I don’t particularly like that purpley stuff that is on cheaper salad mixes) and the dressing was less fruity tasting than I expected.





The crepe tasted better than the place in uptown Waterloo but I think the one at the distillery still wins my tastebuds. Nevertheless, the cheese and the cream sauce made it quite filling. While the steak dish didn’t look as fancy as steak places (nor do the prices reflect those places), it did come out rare as requested, and the meat was quite tasty (their marinade?), juicy and tender.





I finished the entire slice of chocolate cake possibly because the portion size was manageable and the cake itself was not too rich (though I found the white chocolate one much sweeter). But, I don’t generally have a sweet tooth so I tend to choose the fruitier choices of desserts.





<b>Service</b><br>
Seeing that we were two of the three people at the place when we arrived, followed by two business parties, we had attentive service – taking away our plate pretty much as soon as we were done, explianing the selection of desserts. However, I was slightly disappointed that she did not offer to refill our waters or offered tea or coffee to go with our dessert.





<b>Conclusion</b><br>
I haven’t decided whether I would come back for dinner nor is this a favourite on my list, but I would add this to my list of options for a bite of dessert.





Update: I removed the accent aigus and the circumflexes from the French names as it conflicted with the RSS]]>

		<p>				W, as in Wicked.





<a href="http://www.wickedthemusical.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wicked, the musical</a> is now probably one of my favourite productions/performances(from the list of Miss Saigon, Les Miserables, Lion King (great costumes), and Stomp (original), and smaller productions including Into the Woods (great plot and songs), Guys and Dolls, and Seussical). What I liked about Wicked? Mostly the humor and the acting/singing for the cast didn’t seem bored at all (for what must be their X performance). Most of the house gave the performers a standing ovation – though my mother remarks that more and more people give standing ovations these days. I really liked how they played out the story, but it is based on a book. Parts of the show reminded me of Willy Wonka (and the Chocolate Factory) – the colors and the songs of Emerald City – which I didn’t really find too original.





Four of us went downtown (Toronto) on Saturday to enter our names in the lottery to see Wicked for $25 each (retails for $99 for the matinee show, and $110 for the evening). Only one of our four ballots were chosen (among 40 available seats/20 pairs) and I was the date (thankfully, the show was sold out when Joseph wanted to go on his birthday) :). We had the first left upper box (Box D) at the Canon Theatre. The box seat allowed privacy (reminds me of movies where the rich go to view operas) and you could see the details of the costumes, their expressions, the microphones and even parts of the orchestra and the conductor, but one third of the stage was blocked by the speakers. I would recommend that if paying full price, Orchestra seats might have a fuller view (as it is the same price). Ladies, I would suggest you do not use the lavatories during intermission. The line ups were insane; it went around the entire upper floor (though the usher did remark that the Canon Theatre did have plans to build another one).





<b>W, as in Wiimp…wait…Wii.</b>





On Friday night, a few of us were playing Wii Sports (some tennis, and mostly boxing). Two days later, my right arm felt like it just suffered from a flu shot (localized soreness). I didn’t think it was related to Wii playing until another girl came up to me and told me her right arm, shoulders, and upper back were too (like mine). Haha, we’re wimps.]]>		</p>

Every so often, I think about starting a food review blog, because I enjoy trying new places around town. I usually argue my way out of it because:


<ol><li>my blog does not currently support categories and tags</li>




<li>others have quite some <a href="http://www.cs.uwaterloo.ca/~plragde/food/kw-rests.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">extensive</a> <a href="http://www.sentex.net/~dmullin/YPDC/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">experience</a> already in this area</li>




<li>i am too lazy to provide a review of every place i visit</li>




<li>i don’t carry a camera wherever I go (no cell phone camera either) so cannot illustrate my meal</li>


</ol>







Alas, I must ask you, is there a price you are willing pay to meet with a friend, or a few friends? Am I too cheap when I say no because I don’t want to spend money eating out with them? Do I miss the opportunity to catch up with them if I don’t go? Maybe it’s a delicate balance.





<b>Restaurant</b><br>
Last Saturday, an out-of-town friend called me out to join them for dinner at Mel’s Diner. I don’t particularly like Mel’s, but maybe it’s because all I ever get there is their Mel’s Favourite (Breakfast). I agreed because they came from out of town and I would miss the opportunity, but I can tell you that I had a really hard time giving up my $8.99 + tax + tip ($11+).





<b>Meal Choice</b><br>
To be fair to Mel’s, I decided to try an item off their regular menu (and not eat their breakfast). I figured since it was highlighted in red (as opposed to most of their black ink), it must be a popular pick. I ordered the Original B.Bop [read: beef dip] – shaved roasted beef on a toasted garlic buttered bun with melted swiss cheese, served with au jus for dipping. Since I like beef dips, and other places generally serve them, I thought it would be a great choice to compare.





<b>Food Presentation and Quality</b><br>
I chose garden salad as the side.  The salad came with a choice of dressing [raspberry vinagrette (tasted like cough medicine)] and consisted of pure romaine lettuce (browning on the edges), some tomatos and either cucumber or green peppers [I cannot recall].  Perhaps, I associate romaine lettuce with sandwiches and catering tray/plate lining and thus do not really expect it as a salad. The gravy was not very salty, which is actually quite good as some restaurants tend to overdo it on the sodium, but a layer of oil/fat topped the liquid (perhaps suggesting that it was true au jus). The beef sandwich itself came in a toasted hot dog bun, with garlic butter and some roast beef and the cheese on the bun was hardly melted.





<b>Service</b><br>
By the time we were all finished, half the table left because they paid cash, but the rest of us had to wait a very long time for the waitress to notice us [someone finally flagged her down]. Perhaps, I did not have a good impression to start seeing that they took a menu away [understandably I suppose if they were low on them] and everyone got a glass of water except for me [so I had to drank someone else’s] and our pitcher of water never got a refill. I’m not sure what happened to our ketchup either as before one of the girls’ homefries came, one of the servers took our ketchup away.





<b>Conclusion</b><br>
I can probably make something better at home for a lower cost. Often, that’s the case, but usually the atmosphere or the service makes the cost more worthwhile. Sadly, I remember why I prefer Benny’s or Duke of Wellington for breakfast now.

– How are you?
<br><i>Good. You? </i>
<br>
– Fine, thanks. How’s work?
<br><i>Good. …[Awkward pause]… How’s school?</i>
</div>





Communities of people sort of scare me. I always feel so fake around them, because half the time, I don’t know what to say! For me, loitering time [read: refreshments after Sunday Service] is the worst because it feels like a sea of faces – most of them in pre-established social groups. Of course, I try to find better things to do like eat, drink, or run around and do errands.





Well, now I can expand on how work is “good” if anyone cares to know (before, it was just the same old). I can truly say that I have been challenged and have learned more in two months than I have in two years; I actually see results of my efforts. I’m excited about the upcoming changes – a new team lead, moving desks, potential conference, and more work on a big project. This is the opportunity to do what I’ve been wanting to do […on her way to becoming a web geek…].





Since we’re discussing work, a friend of mine (via our professions) has left her day job and is now actively pursuing her entrepreneurial ideas, one of them being <a href="http://www.showoffkit.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Showoffkit</a>: “small business promotion essentials”. Her experience as the Director of Marketing [read: event manager, PR, marketing and business development, social coordinator, jack of all trades.], of a company that grew from a small to medium-sized business will definitely add more value to this line of work. So, if your company needs a starter kit, or just some promotional items (swag), <a href="http://showoffkit.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here’s</a> one option!]]>

		<p>				The Sacred Romance, <i>The Journey of Desire</i> – they are titles that sound like topics on relationships. And, they are. They are two books that I’ve read focusing on a love relationship between God and you (by you, I mean me too). I really enjoyed reading those books, and was deeply saddened to find out that John Eldredge’s co-author and friend, Brent Curtis died from a climbing accident shortly after the first book was published. Unfortunately, I don’t have these books anymore as a friend of mine lent it out to his friends and I never saw the books again.





But because of those two books, when I saw another title by John Eldredge in BAC’s library, I never gave it another thought and promptly borrowed it. Labelled as being fiction and filed under that section, I fully expected <i>Wild at Heart</i> to be a novel, but was I in for a surprise.





As a female, I don’t tend to pick-up books that are written with a male audience in mind. Yet, I wholeheartedly recommend <i>Wild at Heart</i> along with Stephen Arterburn’s <i>Every Man’s Battle</i> (to both genders). While the latter deals with “Winning the War on Sexual Temptation One Victory at a Time” (a man’s struggle with pornography for example), this one dwells more into the psyche of a man’s character (what makes a man, a man) or as the cover says, “Discovering the Secret of a Man’s Soul”. Eldredge seems to suggest the sense of danger and adventure in a man is innate, that God made him that way. It’s also nice to know that there are still some knights out there who want to valiantly rescue a beautiful maiden. By the way, it’s far from being fiction, although some would beg to differ.





If you’re interested in finding out more about Eldredge’s views on this or if the ladies are trying to understand the gents a little more, be sure to sign it out from the church library. Hopefully, my friend, who based some of his Sunday school lessons in the past term on Wild at Heart, has returned it already.

		<p>				November.
November, so soon? Finding flights for the Christmas holidays is proving to be very difficult this year. $800 round trip? I might as well just fly to London for $400 or to Florida for the same price.
<b>Hebrew.</b>
Every time I try teaching (Sunday School), I bring it upon myself to teach something interesting to me and hopefully, interesting (and new) for my students. I’m usually quite stumped at what to teach them, but thankfully, I usually find inspiration right before the term begins. This term’s theme is literature and the Bible. On the first week, I decided to do a lesson on poetry – focusing on parallelism and construction as common elements of Hebrew poetry. What a challenge; I consulted the one Hebrew “expert” I know (though a second might be one quite soon) on a question I had. Turns out, the English (New International Version) Bible contains Hebrew letters! One can learn the entire Hebrew alphabet (in order) in <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=psalm%20119&version=31" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">one chapter</a>. I’ve seen these weird symbols before, but I’ve never realised the meaning of them and why there were there (each verse in that section begins with that letter of the alphabet) until now.
<b>Books and Men.</b> Maybe it’s the postmodernist in me, but I think that media, though may not be 100% theologically sound or interpreted correctly (Veggie Tales comes to my mind), can be used as a tool for people to find out more about God and His relationship with man(kind). I think the key is not to absorb everything you read, but to read critically (as taught in my English course). One such book would be <i>Wild At Heart</i> by John Eldredge. Maybe <i>Wild At Heart</i> doesn’t quite use Scripture correctly, but I know I too am often guilty of misquoting scripture, especially on a blog post – and that’s where you need to be able to read critically.


When I first read the book, I found the book to be interesting, as it presented some ideas not commonly promoted in the church, but not necessarily new either. I think the author was trying to reconcile the whole manhood with the stereotype that Christian guys are “nice” (I can’t really describe it in words, but I have the image right in my head and people who fit this image). Maybe it’s the romantic (or what’s left of one) in me, to think yes, this is a refreshing analysis of the psyche and hope to find Christian men like this. But, at the same time, we want guys who are “nice” as well – can there be a good equilibrium? I suppose that is what those harlequin romance novels are all about (which I avoid reading). Like a friend said (and as I’ve mentioned many posts ago), while girls (whether Christian or not) might be attracted to “dangerous” guys, in the end, we just settle for someone quite the opposite.



On a related note, what is falling in love? I can see it’s easy to “fall in lust” but how does one know whether one has “fallen in love”?]]>		</p>

		<p>				…those who hope in the LORD will renew their strength. They will soar on wings like eagles; they will run and not grow weary, they will walk and not be faint.” (Isaiah 40:31). She trusts Him; the hands of her Father keep her from falling, keeping her secure while lifting her above the white clouds of the blue sky. Her Father stands behind her, taking her to the level of the eagles, higher than the gulls and the ravens that she sees.





As the swing climbs higher with each pendulum motion, the young girl, my spirit, soars to endless limits. On this swing, with the push of my Father’s outstretched arms, I am able to reach unfathomable possibilities.

“We went to the land to which you sent us and, oh! It does flow with milk and honey! Just look at this fruit! The only thing is that the people who live there are fierce, their cities are huge and well fortified. Worse yet, we saw descendants of the giant Anak. Amalekites are spread out in the Negev; Hittites, Jebusites, and Amorites hold the hill country; and the Canaanites are established on the Mediterranean Sea and along the Jordan.





 	Caleb interrupted, called for silence before Moses and said, “Let’s go up and take the land–now. We can do it.”





    But the others said, “We can’t attack those people; they’re way stronger than we are.” They spread scary rumors among the People of Israel. They said, “We scouted out the land from one end to the other–it’s a land that swallows people whole. Everybody we saw was huge. Why, we even saw the Nephilim giants (the Anak giants come from the Nephilim). Alongside them we felt like grasshoppers. And they looked down on us as if we were grasshoppers.”





  Joshua son of Nun and Caleb son of Jephunneh, members of the scouting party, ripped their clothes and addressed the assembled People of Israel: “The land we walked through and scouted out is a very good land–very good indeed. If GOD is pleased with us, he will lead us into that land, a land that flows, as they say, with milk and honey. And he’ll give it to us. Just don’t rebel against GOD! And don’t be afraid of those people. Why, we’ll have them for lunch! They have no protection and GOD is on our side. Don’t be afraid of them!”





    But, up in arms now, the entire community was talking of hurling stones at them.
</div>





(Numbers 13:26-30, 14:6-10, The Message)





What happened? The land was flowing of milk and honey – they even brought back the fruits of the land to show everyone: it was not manna! Yet, fear quickly spread like a bushfire among the people which consumed any remainder of faith in Yahweh, who had always provided for them.





President F. Roosevelt once wisely remarked, “We have nothing to fear, but fear itself.” For me, I know that to be true. Fear carries my imagination far, far away and sometimes even hides behind the mask commonly known as worry. Maggots become huge squishy worms that don’t die (even though I know I am bigger than them), roller coasters and the echoing screams make them look bigger and worse than they are (they’re fun!), and snowboarding down an unfamiliar run makes me wary of falling off a cliff again (but without going down once, I would never know what is ahead). If I have little faith in small challenges, where will my faith be in big ones?





Junior Asparagus, in the Veggies Tales video <i>Where’s God When I’m S-Scared?</i> aptly sings, “<i>God is bigger than the boogey man, He’s bigger than Godzilla or the monsters on TV. Oh God is bigger than the boogey man, and He’s watching out for you and me.</i>”





I know that conquering fear does not mean I should pay no heed to caution, but when I know that God has paved a way for me, perhaps in the areas of service or ministry, fear should not have a place.





God prepared the Promise Land for the Israelites, but they ended up not being able to claim it as theirs (in later attempts to enter by force, their efforts were, of course, futile).





The LORD replied,


<blockquote>


<div>
I have forgiven them, as you asked. Nevertheless, as surely as I live and as surely as the glory of the LORD fills the whole earth, not one of the men who saw my glory and the miraculous signs I performed in Egypt and in the desert but who disobeyed me and tested me ten times- 23 not one of them will ever see the land I promised on oath to their forefathers. No one who has treated me with contempt will ever see it. 24 But because my servant Caleb has a different spirit and follows me wholeheartedly, I will bring him into the land he went to, and his descendants will inherit it.
</div>


</blockquote>

(Numbers 14: 20-24, The Message)





Does fear interfere with doing God’s will? Are we withholding ourselves from blessings and promises from Him when we hold back because of fear? What happened on the outskirts of Canaan serves to be a good reminder for me to step out and trust God in all I do.

		<p>				HGCC), seemed to be “prettier” (though, HGCC has more info) and conveniently, the meeting location is closer to my house. I decided to give them a try since they let you sit in for free for the first time (apparently, HGCC charges $5 for a “guest” fee). Perhaps, it was also the name that drew me to them. I was hoping that I might use a photography association as the “professional association” that my company encourages us to join and “club” just sounds less “professional” than “society” does even though the club is actually associated with <a href="http://www.capacanada.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Canadian Association of Photographic Art</a>.





I must have stood out like a sore thumb tonight:


</p><ol><li>I was Asian (there was 1 other).</li>




<li>I was young.<br>You know you’re too young when a member happily tells everyone that you can go to Value Village to get props for your shots at 20% off on Senior Tuesdays. Okay, so maybe the younger ones have families or studies that take up their time, but I know plenty of young photo enthusiasts these days – so where are they? (or maybe this is too geeky/out of style for them )
</li>


</ol>


I guess with age comes wisdom, right? What better than to learn from the wise (and the experienced!). The session was on tabletop photography and the speaker, a lady from another photo club, came in to give us ideas and to inspire us with her work. In addition to the stunning results one can get with some very simple props, I was amazed to see how two slide projectors plus a cassette player can work together to produce a presentation that looked and felt like a Microsoft Powerpoint slideshow (see how young I am!), maybe even better with the fading/layover effect and I’ve always enjoyed the sound of the slides advancing. The last time, I’ve worked with slides and a projector was back in 2003 for a professor at UBC! Most of them, understandably, didn’t work with digital (and still prefer film over digital).





Perhaps I should venture a little further and check out the other club. With a slightly higher membership fee and more members, maybe the age range would be more balanced. On a related note, my housemate and I compared prints from Kodak vs. Fuji film (yes, we are still using film). Seems like Fuji brings out reds, blues (and yellow?) better, while Kodak brings out the greens (though it could also be the photo lab that developed it or the ISO). So, I guess depending on what you are shooting, try using one versus the other.





Funnily enough, this experience reminds me of attending a church or youth group meeting. Everyone comes together with a common interest – both amateurs and novices are welcome. The meeting occurs in a more-or-less structured manner, and at some point, money is collected (optional freewill donation/giving). At the photography clubs, it seems to be 50/50 draws (where 50% goes into the funds pot, and the rest goes to the winner) and at a church, the offering plate or bag and you can get a tax receipt. Someone shares their insight and everyone learns or contributes and asks question in the process. When new faces show, both groups tend to single you out and ask for a short introduction to the group. The one key difference: Jesus.
