		<p>				<strong>Roadtrip to San Fransico, California, August 24-31, 2002</strong></p>




<p>Aug 24, 2002<br> I now know why I useta keep a record of my trips. I don’t remember where exactly we went anymore. Boo. Anyhow, we started off our road trip at about 6:30 am (or perhaps even earlier) and drove down to the border in this really uncomfortable Alero (Oldsmobile) (and not very powerful either). I was stuck in the middle for the most part of the first lag of the trip to the point where my tailbone (whiplash permanent damages) began to complain of pain again. We stopped for lunch someplace — think maybe it was near Oregon U…as we drove past Portland’s chinatown. Along the way, we stopped at a factory outlet and because the CK store was closing, bought some pants for a mere $12.50 CDN, a shirt at Banana Republic and some others at Gap Factory Store.</p>




<p>On the first night after a dinner in some hick town (where we got paranoid b/c some guy asked us if we were from out-of-town and if we knew were the police station was), we stayed at a Holiday Inn Express in Grant’s Pass, Oregon. My brother complained b/c there was not an indoor pool. However, this room was a suite-style so we escaped from my dad’s snoring :P. The beds were also queen-sized, which meant that my sister didn’t complain of me kicking her and hoggin all the blanket and shoving her to the edge of the bed (unlike the other nights).</p>




<p>Aug 25, 2002<br> In the morning, we were late gettin’ out and thus, missed church. Not that there were many churches to choose from mind you…However, we did go to Oregon Caves and participated in a tour that lasted approximately 75 minutes. The caves averaged to about 5C but we were equipped with light jackets to keep warm :).</p>




<p>Driving to Crescent City took awhile, but we managed to arrive at the small town (with beautiful scenery!) and had seafood for dinner at AppleBee’s (some chain restaurant). The hotel (Anchorage Inn?) we stayed at really lacked in quality. Although it’s noteably the “newest” hotel in town, the rooms were dirty, the furniture used, and the service was really poor.</p>




<p>Aug 26,2002<br> On our way to San Fransisco, California, we drove through Redwood National Park and through some massively tall and huge redwood trees. Kinda like Stanley Park but much vaster in the sheer numbers of trees. Tons of Oxygen there i suppose :P. We inched our car “backwards” through the drive-thru shrine tree, which is this massively tall tree that has a hole in the middle of it. 3/4 of this tree is dead but 1/4 of it still continues to grow. For dinner that night, we stopped along the way at a steakhouse called Cowboy’s or something like that. As I’m not too into steak, I only say that it was decent, tho my family liked it.</p>




<p>By the time we arrived in SF, it was dark so we checked in the Holiday Inn (Golden Gateway–tho I don’t remember it lookin’ quite like the picture does), it actually sleeps better than Delta Hotels, though Delta has a nicer balcony view. This one lacked a balcony even tho we were on the 22nd floor (or something?).</p>




<p>Aug 27,2002<br> *yawn!*, apparently I kept kicking my sister in my sleep and hoggin’ all the blanket :). heh…anyhow, took the street cable car to the cable car museum (and place where they run the cables). I never knew that it was the cable underneath the cars that pull them along. For lunch, we had a meal at IHOP, then browsed on Pier 51 (or was it 39–one of them is Fisherman’s Wharf) and took some pics and then I forgot what we did for the rest of the day. Agh. Must’ve been unimportant. But it’s still buggin’ me…oh! we might’ve gone shopping at the Espirit store, which was closing; it was its last day in business in all of SF. Thus, when we got there, everything was 75% off, and then just as they were goin’ to close, they announced everything was $2.00 USD 🙂 (so works out to be 3 bucks CDN!). Even though they did not have a fitting room (which they sold as well), I managed to grab at least 4 skirts (same cut, different design), flowery capris (i hate capris but since they were 2 dollars, i can use them in the house), and maybe something else, but I can’t remember what. =). This is all thanks to my bro who reaped the intent of street flyer advertising. dinner…what did we eat…er…??? OHOH, I don’t remember if it was this day or the next, but we visited SF’s downtown, which reminds me of NYC b/c of all these really big-name stores, and had cheesecake (YUMS! I had the keylime one) at the famous Cheesecake Factory–pricey, but worth it! 🙂 My mom had the firecracker salmon rolls, a very yummy appetizer too, along w some really yummy iced mango drink! Tho’ a late afternoon snack, we had Costco hotdogs for a light dinner–to balance everything. At Costco, I picked up a 128MB SMcard for my dig cam for a mere $75CDN! ;).</p>




<p>Aug 28,2002<br> Good mornin’! Cable car-ed to Pier 39 (Fisherman’s Wharf), and took the Ferry to Alcatraz Island (home to the movie, The Rock). I was skeptical at first about the quality of an self-audio tour, but the recorded tour was very detailed–along w sound effects, and testimonials from ex-convicts and wardens. Very well done! Apparently, it’s award-winning. However, advice to future tourists, the place is sooo cold and windy; I was afraid i’d get sick! Thankfully I didn’t and lived to eat the food in SF’s Chinatown. Apparently, the restaurant we picked was a good one (X and Y’s Lounge–X and Y being arbitrary b/c I can’t remember what it’s called)–the food tasted good and many ppl came and went. However, I think some of us had a stomach rxn to it anyhow. Ate in the afternoon at a seafood restaurant in Fisherman’s Wharf. The manager there was extremely nice; after my bro complained that his plate of food was too cold, the dessert (two as it’s equiv to price of the meal) was on the house :).</p>




<p>Aug 29,2002<br> Off to Oregon Coast! As we headed back home, we stopped along the Coast for some dune buggyin’. The sand was sooo beautiful as it reflected from the sun. The sand is soo fine and soft there too (my feet just sank in the sand)! What a ride! Instead of steering our own buggy’s (which would’ve prolly been fun as well), we opted to take a guided thrill ride, where the buggy sat 6 of us, and the driver would steer us up and down, to the max of 35MPH or slightly over. Apparently, my dad wasn’t too thrilled as it felt like a 30 min coaster ride…*grins*. I definitely recommend it, and since we were in a 4-pt harness, there isn’t too much to worry about. The driver does this for the summer and allegedly gets paid $9.00/hr USD plus tips to do this every day :). How fun (tho I think that would be “tai chi gik” for me). We continued driving until we hit a Fred Meyer’s to eat lunch there (sushi) and explore a sand dune and to take some pix. Yes, although my pictures seem to have sand dunes in them, they were actually directly behind the Fred Meyer’s hehehe.</p>




<p>Our last night was spent in Lincoln City, with dinner at Wendy’s and some shopping at the Factory Outlets. Continuing on, the next day was spent shopping the ENTIRE day. First, at Lincoln City, then on the way back to Vancouver, we detoured to Sea Side and shopped there (more Factory Outlets) and had a seafood dinner at a local bar and grill, prior to arriving home at 2 AM. The city-line of Seattle is soo beautiful at night (as seen from the I-5/interstate) esp w the “needle”. I wish I had my camera ready, but when I did, it was already too late =(. And, that ends my trip. Phew. The week felt like eternity tho’; it was nice to be home again :).</p>




<p> </p>




<p>Again, this is B.P signing off.</p>

    As we left the house at 8:54 AM PST, a white VW Beetle drove by and surprised
    us all when we saw that it was a courtesy car from a car dealer. That must
    be a sweet deal for the person who brought her (I’m assuming, as Beetles are
    more suited as a chic car) car into the shop for repairs-unless of course,
    she was driving a Beetle herself.
  

</p><p>9:41 AM <br>
    A riced neon roars by with spoiler/rear wing, body kit, lights, muffler and
    paint job. Very disturbing to the eyes and ears. And if that wasn’t enough,
    at 11:53 AM, we boarded a plane full of fobs (a big surprise here). One realization
    came to my brother and I though. The Hongers cannot be fobs, b/c they didn’t
    get off the plane to land in HK, so does that mean we, the CBCs, are fobs
    in HK?! </p>


  

<p>A small A340. I cannot tell the difference between that and a 767. But it
    seemed scarier that a plane that is almost the same size as the 767 (the plane
    that took me from Ontario to British Columbia), would carry me 12 hours to
    HK! Prior to takeoff, I sneaked a magazine off the executive-class (I think)
    shelf and shocked my mother into asking me if my “boyfriends” in
    Ottawa were interested in cars, because it was entitled, “Car & Driver”-there
    are some interesting things in that magazine. It beats the one on street racing
    and car parts that my brother bought before we boarded. </p>


  

<p>Saturday, August 18, 2001 </p>


  

<p>17:05 HK Standard Time <br>
    Heat wasn’t too bad the first day. It kinda reminded me of extreme Ottawa
    heat at 32 C (excluding humidity). </p>


  

<p>21:00 <br>
    Dinner at some restaurant that I have never been to-probably because my grandfather
    would have never approved of this food and “low classness” if he
    was still around. I enjoyed my first quail from HK (since 98), and had yummy
    “tong choy” (or “oong choy”), even though I just had some
    before I left Ottawa. </p>


  

<p>I actually went shopping in HK. My first stop was at Bossini, where I proceeded
    to buy clothes that actually fit me! At $6 CDN, the black cubic-zuchornia
    (however you spell that word-in any case, they remind me of diamonds), strapped
    top was definitely a good bargain! In HK, the exchange rate was on the average
    about $5 HKD: $1 CDN. I can’t believe that in HK, of all places, there are
    actually people who rice their cars-whatever for?! By the way, in case you
    don’t understand some Ottawa lingo-like my brother, I will explain some terms
    here and there: “rice” is the same thing as “soup” or
    “accessorize” when it comes to cars. </p>


  

<p>23:00 <br>
    Why, you ask, am I using army or Quebec style of time?! Actually, I’m not
    sure. I think I picked it up in one of the mystery books that I useta read
    and I liked that system because it’s so unique and causes less confusion.
    I remember that in Waterloo, Carey used it many times to organize cell group
    meetings and all, and even though I had to constantly subtract the last digit
    by 2, to determine the time, it kinda stuck. </p>


  

<p>Surprising, I went to bed by 23:00. I was tired. But not really jet-lagged
    b/c I didn’t wake up ’til the next morning (unlike in ’93 when I woke up at
    4:00 and couldn’t go back to sleep). </p>


  

<p>Sunday, August 19, 2001 </p>


  

<p>I started having dreams again. That night, I dreamt that that I was on the
    verge of missing my third exam in the examination period. I was talking to
    Jen (Waterloo classmate at one point in time and good friend), and suddenly
    realised that it was the 17th, and that I had exams scheduled on the 15th,
    16th, 17th, 30th, and 31st of August. I was supposed to be writing a geometry
    test on that day and was freaking out b/c all of my finals were worth 40%
    (sounds like high school!) and I had already missed 2. </p>


  

<p>That morning, at around 10:30, we headed to a Whampoa Alliance Church, a
    small Chinese church that played really old contemporary music and hymns,
    much more older than OCAC’s style of worship. The funny thing is that the
    name, “Whampoa”, actually sounds more Flip or of some other ethnicity
    other than Chinese. The sermon was considerably easy to understand, considering
    I had my Palm with me with the NIV bible on it, and the speaker was talking
    about the Prayer of Jabez. All I needed to do was to read my newly acquired
    book, The Prayer of Jabez, a gift from the Billy Graham Ministry, to understand
    the whole sermon. What shocked me, when I read the book, was that the pastor
    took everything from the book, including the analogies. </p>


  

<p>Lunch at 12:50. I have never realised that a Chinese custom of reserving
    a table is to stand behind a seated party and wait for them to leave before
    you grab their seats. I’ve realised why Dom says that he’s sick of Chinese
    food-you can only have so much dim sum before you get sick of it too. Especially
    if you have dim sum for breakfast, dim sum for lunch . . . thank God that
    it wasn’t dim sum for dinner! Although, we did go to a restaurant across the
    street from our place for dinner, that DOES serve dim sum during the day.
    🙂 </p>


  

<p>Upon arriving to that restaurant at 19:47, memories flooded me as I recalled
    having some tea or some sauce spilt on me by the waiter in 98-that was when
    I realised how effective Shout (shout it out!) was and I have been using it
    ever since (great way for some advertising eh? :P). I think my grandmother
    is a VIP customer there, because the service was so good and the waitresses
    knew her name (well, last name anyhow). They offered tea 4 times, because
    we were drinking sugar cane juice instead. Yum! </p>


  

<p>My sister, being a Broadway freak, decided to sing a song from Annie, in
    the middle of the evening, and for the rest of the night, I had the chorus,
    “It’s a hard-knocked life . . .” going around in my head-not the
    actual song mind you, but the one that Silq kept playing in Ottawa. </p>


  

<p>During that day, I made a couple of general observations: </p>


  

<p>My brother kept wanting to play with my Palm. <br>
    There are really odd-looking cars in HK, and cars that aren’t seen here in
    Canada, like the Mitsubishi Lancer. <br>
    Internet withdrawal is no fun at all. And even though there is a cyber café
    right next door, my parents didn’t think it was safe for me to wander down
    there. <br>
    Monday, August 20, 2001 <br>
    Another night of strange dreams including a portion where I was shooting at
    people with a gun made of Lego, and another, where I was at a banquet with
    a family (parents) I didn’t know very well with one other person I knew I
    think. </p>


  

<p>Off to Ocean Park we went. My third time there (’82, ’93, ’01), but this
    time, we went with our cousins and my aunt. That day, I decided to wear shorts
    (because it was very sunny and hot). It was a good and a bad thing: the good
    part was that I was able to get a slight tan line (which seems to have disappeared
    already), and the bad was that I managed to obtain 5 very itchy mosquito bites-all
    at one ride: the Raging River. Consequently, I never wore shorts outdoors
    again during my trip. The Raging River was located under trees (provides the
    bugs shade), and it had really dirty water (nice place for them to lurk),
    but the ride was fun-didn’t close my eyes this time when we dropped! 🙂 The
    Dragon, which is a roller coaster boasting to be the biggest in HK, was once
    again fun and this time, I didn’t close my eyes for the loops as I did in
    93, either ;). The Flying Swing is much like the one at PNE/Playland-very
    calm and soothing. However, the virtual ride does not compare to the one in
    Universal Studios, Hollywood at all! This one lasted maybe a mere 5 minutes
    and it wasn’t too “extreme” (too bad). One funny incident that almost
    costed my mother her ankle, was that we were talking about bats and all of
    a sudden, a couple of black butterflies flew around us, and I screamed, “BAT!”-heheh,
    my mom freaked. </p>


  

<p>Dinner was spent at my aunt’s. Her maid cooked up some yummy meal, and surprised
    us all because when she first started her job at my aunt/uncle’s place, she
    didn’t know how to cook so she read off some cookbooks that my aunt bought
    for her (b/c she useta be a supervisor for the rest of the maids at some temperamental,
    rich famous guy’s place). I later realised how well off that area was, especially
    with so many nice cars, and a somewhat famous singer by the name of Shirley
    Kwan (admittedly, whom I have never heard) that lives next-door. </p>


  

<p>Tuesday, August 21, 2001 </p>


  

<p>More interesting dreams. One of them I attended a small church fellowship
    in HK and one of the guys made me feel welcome and asked me where I was from,
    etc. etc. </p>


  

<p>Cold water showers are so much warmer than cold water showers at night. I
    don’t like taking cold showers in general, but I didn’t know how to work the
    hot water. I later realised that you had to wait a couple of minutes before
    each tiny change of temperature would take into effect. </p>


  

<p>I accompanied my mother and my aunt and my sister in hopes that I would be
    able to buy something while my mom was shopping for shoes. Unfortunately,
    she literally stuck to the plan and for many hours straight, all we did was
    look at shoes. Thankfully, I managed to purchase something, not exactly what
    I was looking for (clothes), but oh well, a pair of sandals for $20 CDN is
    still pretty good :). Thankfully, we got a break from shopping in the evening,
    when we went bowling at the Hong Kong Cricket Club that my aunt’s family belongs
    to in Happy Valley. Yes, my aunt’s garage alone in Happy Valley is home to
    some nice cars: Audi TT, Porsche Boxter, a Ferrari of some sort. Others that
    zoom by include Z3s, s2000s, and 911s, MR2 (not Spyder though). Skyline seen
    in Tsim Sha Tsui. </p>


  

<p>Wednesday, August 22, 2001 </p>


  

<p>I think I’m a l’il “Ottawa”-sick because my dreams that evening,
    had Dom, Josh, and Marc in them. In one of my dreams, I figured that if “Melancholy”
    didn’t have such a depressing association with it, it would be a nice name
    b/c it’s 4 syllables in length and one could shorten it to “Mel”.
  </p>


  

<p>Today, we went bowling yet again. I seem to only bowl well with a 9 lb bowling
    ball. The unfortunate thing was that there was only 1 of those available to
    be shared w 4 lanes. Everything else ends up in the gutter. Sigh :\. I don’t
    think I’ve ever bowled this many times in a week before. </p>


  

<p>We also went to the CityPlaza Shopping Centre and while my mom shopped for
    shoes, my sis and I decided to explore the rest of the place and discovered
    that the Disney Store had a closing sale and everything was ½ price
    off the lowest ticketed price!! We were lucky (I don’t believe in luck) because
    2 days after when we went again, it was already closed. I bought a couple
    of items, including a Mulan VHS video (in Cantonese) for $8 CDN. However,
    in my AV ignorance, I didn’t realise that the videos in HK could not play
    in Canadian VCRs unless one has a dual VCR (which we don’t). I also bought
    two ¾-sleeve shirts for $9 CDN each at U2. </p>


  

<p>Thursday, August 23, 2001 </p>


  

<p>Our family and my grandmother left HK early to take the train to Shenzhen
    (45 min to 1 hr train ride). I think I understand why we like to stereotype
    “big green” people-most have a less sophisticated lifestyle than
    the average HK resident. If you ask me to go to Shenzhen again, I think I’d
    have to think twice. </p>


  

<p>We stopped at a restaurant for some lunch. There, I discovered that using
    tea to wash dishes in TO or Ottawa is nothing compared to what they do in
    China; they actually give you a bowl of tea to rinse your dishes in before
    they take the dirty tea bowl away. And I thought that was bad. The dim sum
    is the most disgusting restaurant food I’ve had in a very long time! I refused
    to eat the pork spareribs because my mom told me that they went bad, and my
    shark-fin dumpling soup tasted like “soap water” (gan-sui). Most
    people in Shenzhen speak Mandarin (and only understand Mandarin) now, even
    though this was originally a place of Canton descent. Getting around this
    area would be difficult if one did not know any Chinese at all. The maid (who
    is 23 years old), at the place where I was staying, was surprised to learn
    that I did not speak or know any Mandarin (well, “any” is almost
    right considering China Mandarin is not what I know). I don’t think she realises
    that in Canada, not every “jook sing” is bilingual in Cantonese
    and Mandarin. And if a “jook sing” is fluent in one of these dialects,
    that is already pretty impressive in itself. </p>


  

<p>Shopping. Negotiating is not something I’m professionally good at-so I leave
    all the negotiating with my mom. Somehow, we ended up negotiating a cell-phone
    cover from 10 RMB (Ren Men Bi?-China currency is 10% less than HK) to about
    6 RMB (that’s around $1 CDN). In retrospect, I believe that we could’ve done
    better. Ah well. It’s only $1. </p>


  

<p>That night, we went to some cultural centre to view a costume poetic performance.
    Many tourists from HK were there. Thankfully, it took place indoors (w mild
    AC) so we didn’t die in the heat. The mini bus system is crazy there! They
    squished at least 50 people in a 16 or-so-seats mini bus. I almost suffocated
    in there. </p>


  

<p>I can probably say that a missions trip to China was very appealing to me
    until I went on this 1-day trip. I don’t think I can stand having to live
    without toilets for a month or so. Even though at some places, the holes in
    the floor are flushable and are surrounded with ceramic, I’m just thankful
    that I was paranoid enough to bring a roll of toilet paper w me from Vancouver
    ;P. Well, there’s always Kleenex packs, but I don’t like using them. The technique
    of peeing in a hole. Well, anyhow, I envy the guys when it comes to this.
  </p>


  

<p>Friday, August 24, 2001 </p>


  

<p>After spending a very hot night (the AC shut off in the middle of the night)
    trying to sleep on a sofa bed (hard plywood board at the top and soft at bottom),
    my mom, sis and I decided to leave early b/c we couldn’t stand the heat (yeah,
    I know we’re wimps/high maintenance). There was a heatstroke warning that
    day anyhow. I don’t think we would’ve survived if we were to go the “Small
    World” park of the miniature wonders/landmarks of the world. </p>


  

<p>Spent the evening at my aunts after s’more shopping. I bought 2 pairs of
    semi-casual sandals for $10 CDN each (nice but they have heels that are waay
    too high for me-well, at least I can now be at least 2.5 inches taller! :)).
    Boy, is HK so much cooler in comparison to Shenzhen! </p>


  

<p>Saturday, August 25, 2001 </p>


  

<p>This time, my dreams had Peon, Marc, Jon, Dom, and Josh in it. Peon asked
    me a strange question but I can’t remember what it was exactly or why she
    asked it. </p>


  

<p>In the evening, I met up with Jen Lam at Causeway Bay after a morning of
    shopping at Wan Chai (bought a shoulder bag for a mere $4 CDN) and an afternoon
    of bowling. It was our first time in HK without people taking us around, so
    it was an adventure. I took Jen shoe shopping (because I was there earlier
    in the week when my mom was looking for shoes-the reason why she looks for
    shoes like mad is because she’s only a size 34 (4-5) and not many stores carry
    that size) and Jen took me to the Hello Kitty Café to eat dinner. It’s
    a very “cute” café. Everything is Hello Kitty-from the tables/chairs
    to the food itself-the “soy” meat in the noodles were shaped in
    the face of Hello Kitty. </p>


  

<p>I think if I didn’t meet up with Jen that day, I wouldn’t have been able
    to find such good deals in HK b/c we ended up stopping at U2 and we bought
    the same pair of pants ($8 CDN though the price tag said $12CDN/$60 HKD)-except
    she commented that I gained weight b/c she fits a M and I had to take an XL
    b/c they had no more L left and usually, we’re about the same size in weight
    and height :P. I also grabbed one ¾-sleeve long-sleeves for $6 CDN,
    and 2 v-necked T’s (style like my white one but w/o buttons) for $2.40 CDN
    each. 🙂 I think she bought a T too, cept she chose one size smaller than
    what I had (because I don’t like it when it shrinks in the dryer). </p>


  

<p>Sunday, August 26, 2001 </p>


  

<p>After church that morning, we decided to see the Whampoa mall, which has
    a very unique architectural design-a cruise ship structure-very interesting,
    especially when you can see it from the harbour. On the StarCruise Leo, we
    were able to see this mall smack in the middle of residential buildings, looking
    as if it was a scene from Speed II. </p>


  

<p>The StarCruise Leo-first time on a cruise. First impression of lobby area:
    woah, this is like a hotel (somehow it reminded me of West Ed Mall)! Each
    ship of the company is named after an astrological star/constellation, but
    my brother made an interesting comment, “What about StarCruise Cancer?!”
    as he noticed that his “sign” was missing from the fleet). During
    that entire day, I felt like I was coming down with something because I felt
    like throwing up because my stomach was quite wheezy-and during the previous
    night, while my sister was warm in her sleep, I was freezing cold. It didn’t
    help that I still feel the ship move, even in mild weather. </p>


  

<p>During this trip, I developed an interesting theory on why I don’t like airplanes
    rides. I think it’s because it’s constantly rocking/moving, and one’s enclosed
    in such a tight space. Not to mention that whenever I fall asleep, I’m half
    self-conscious b/c of where my head goes-if it leans over to the next person,
    if it falls forward, etc. </p>


  

<p>There’s not too much to do on a cruise ship. Internet access is $8 CDN for
    ½ hr and everything else (such as arcades) require money as well. The
    only thing I did that day was “swim” (or splashed around -that’s
    more like it), saw a dance/acrobatics stage show (with Vegas showgirls but
    they, thankfully, had clothes on in this session) where in one act, a woman
    used a bow and arrow to shoot an apple off of her own head! Very dangerous
    indeed. </p>


  

<p>Monday, August 27, 2001 </p>


  

<p>Around noon, we arrived at Sayan Hainan Island, China. Our family joined
    a bus tour to a big Buddhist temple. We made a bathroom stop along the way-you
    know, the places where the tour guides and the company has an agreement that
    if we buy into what they are trying to sell us (this time it’s “lian-zhi”
    leaves), the tour guides get a percentage of commission. The ladies seem to
    be the ones that target you-they try to push you to buy their products like
    crazy. Anyhow, I can’t believe I went to the bathroom here; I had to endure
    another “holy” one. See, if I knew that the temple actually had
    toilets, I probably would’ve used those instead. Sigh. </p>


  

<p>Sheesh, the roads there are worse than those in Montréal-tons of potholes
    that shoot you to the ceiling. I was really tired so I managed to catch a
    wink of sleep because I was extremely tired that day. There was not much to
    see at the temple. However, I did learn that they were starting to build an
    idol/statue that would reach higher than the Statue of Liberty in New York.
    That’s crazy. Next, they’ll probably repeat the story of the Tower of Babel
    as told in Genesis. The vegetarian meal was done quite well though at the
    local temple restaurant. Much of the texture of the imitation meat (soy) was
    very close and it tasted quite like the flavour of the meat dish. </p>


  

<p>On our way back, the tour bus let us stop to try some “tea”-one
    kind of tea they let the group try was made from “foo-gua” (bitter
    melon). It tasted very interesting. There were other bitter teas that they
    brewed, but after we tried them all, the ladies once again tried to sell them
    to us-I can’t believe that a can of tea leaves would cost at least $80 CDN!
  </p>


  

<p>By the time we boarded on the ship again, it was around 19:02. I was somewhat
    hungry again, and during dinner, my sister and I ate a 3 course Western meal,
    while my parents and my brother chose the Chinese set menu. According to my
    sister, I apparently “eat a lot”-she said that I used to eat less
    than she did. Well, if that is the case, I’m grateful for a high metabolism
    rate then, because I haven’t gained much (if any) for many years now :). </p>


  

<p>After an evening show at the theatre (which included a synchronised light
    and music show, and an elderly lady in the audience energetically following
    the cast dancing to the YMCA onstage-which was mighty impressive), my sis
    and I decided to check out the small casino that was on the ship with my mom
    in tow. As we arrived at the door, the security guards asked us “young
    ladies” to step aside (you see, the age of majority is 18 there so my
    sis wanted to take the opportunity to see something like this before she heads
    back to Canada and waits another year). As my mother waited for a cross-reference
    check (asked us for our access cards and called security office) on her kids,
    my sister in a stage-whisper loudly proclaims to me, “But, you’re 21!”
    ‘Twas quite amusing because I don’t think the security guard actually believed
    her because he turned to take a glance at me, considering I think he probably
    thought my sister was older than I was-and until the reference confirmed that
    we were of legal age. All he said was, “Thank you,” as we walked
    off smirking. </p>


  

<p>Tuesday, August 28, 2001 </p>


  

<p>This time, my dreams contained Melody C., and Ben C. in them (they are not
    related. Melody is from my high school and Ben is from UW). </p>


  

<p>At 7:30, the ship docks in Danang, Vietnam and we disembark for another tour.
    This time, we joined a bus/walking tour to the local museums and embroidery
    shops/galleries. </p>


  

<p>Impressions of Central Vietnam (first time in Vietnam): </p>


  

<p>Many signs of a developing (poor) country/city. <br>
    Too many motorbikes/cycles/scooters zooming on the roads. <br>
    Driving a bus or any type of vehicle is like playing the arcade game, “Crazy
    Taxi”. Sitting in the front seat of the bus is very scary. All you see
    is the bus getting so close to these bikes and most of the riders aren’t even
    wearing proper helmets (and to think that in China, we saw the remains of
    a bike accident w the helmet on the ground and the body gone). <br>
    There are too many people on the streets trying to sell goods to the tourists,
    especially to the foreigners (ie. Non-Asian) because they don’t know how to
    bargain with their prices/products. They know that it’s illegal to sell on
    private property, so they loiter around the building until we step onto the
    street, and then they start hounding us again, trying to make us pity them.
    Actually, I was lucky, I didn’t get bugged even though the rest of my family
    did (including my sister). I have a couple of theories on why: A) I followed
    behind the Australians (so to lose the focus) or B) I don’t look like I have
    any money on me b/c I still look young. These peddlers are willing to follow
    us around for blocks! <br>
    Food in this part of Vietnam definitely does not compare to pho in Canada.
    Maybe we were not served the best, but the pho and spring rolls are really
    gross compared to the Canadian Vietnamese food. However, dragon fruit has
    a very interesting taste to it. <br>
    At this point, I concluded that I felt fat (for once). All we ever did on
    the cruise was eat, eat, and eat. No time to digest. I remember that towards
    the end, I kept feeling hungry 1 hour after I ate a meal, even though I knew
    that I just ate. Thankfully, I don’t think I gained any, if much. If I did,
    it’s only a maximum of 1 lb. (but unfortunately, it would be in the wrong
    areas). </p>


  

<p>Back at the ship, we watched Cast Away, starring Tom Hanks and featuring
    Helen Hunt (I wonder if Dom has this one). I didn’t like it b/c I almost fell
    asleep-the storyline went a l’il too slow for my liking, and we had to endure
    1 hour of monologue w/o any musical background. I don’t understand why they
    chose to feature this film though, due to the fact that we were, afterall,
    on a cruise and the weather was becoming stormy. Well, at least they didn’t
    show Titanic (although the drills they had at the beginning had life jackets
    much like those on the Titanic). </p>


  

<p>Stormy weather. Not very pleasant on a cruise. I decided to be adventurous
    so I went outside alone, but it wasn’t a very good move because I almost was
    stuck out there. The winds were so high (not to mention that it was starting
    to rain) that the main doors were steeled shut and the smaller doors were
    soooo hard to pull back open b/c of the air/wind pressure or something. I
    had to pull with all my might. I think it was also around then that I decided
    to go down to the Captain’s bridge again (pretty much an area where you can
    see the “cockpit” if you were in a plane) to see what it was like
    up front. Guess what? They turned off one of their radars, and they were using
    binoculars to see! I was like, uh-oh, that doesn’t seem right. There must
    be a lot of fog or something-glad no icebergs got in the way 😛 </p>


  

<p>During the evening, I beat my brother at the arcades (racing a Celica vs.
    NS-X or something and out-cycled my brother on the physical virtual bike race).
    I slept well that night, but most of my family members didn’t because the
    ship was rocking too heavily. </p>


  

<p>Wednesday, August 29, 2001 </p>


  

<p>Surprisingly, I didn’t experience sea sickness, but my sister got mildy sick
    and we saw the remnants of someone’s breakfast on the carpet. </p>


  

<p>This time, we spent another $6 CDN on arcades (that’s $3 each) and my brother
    beat my choice of car (MR2) and beat me on the bike by 1 second or so. Ah
    well. You win some, you lose some. </p>


  

<p>We docked and disembarked around 16:00. Does it ever feel good to be on land
    again :). Oddly (psychological effects I suppose), on occasions, I still felt
    the floor moving as if I was still at sea. After my first time on a cruise,
    I don’t think I’ll be too overly excited to go on another cruise again. Firstly,
    there’s not much to do on a ship that cannot be done elsewhere on land (as
    everything isn’t free), you don’t get to visit too many exciting places, and
    all you do is eat. I think that because it’s a Chinese tour group, that it’s
    also very noisy and rude (especially when they’re all fighting for buffet
    food). </p>


  

<p>Eew. I don’t think I will ever dare to drink wine that contains dead, preserved
    baby mice. That’s what my grandmother has in one of her shelves. Gives me
    the creeps even though I don’t mind dissecting these rodents. </p>


  

<p>Thursday, August 30, 2001 </p>


  

<p>During the previous evening, it started to really pour in HK. Even the ceilings
    in our apartment started to leak (and annoyed me to death as I was trying
    to sleep and all I could hear was plink-plink into the buckets). </p>


  

<p>I actually spotted the first VW beetle on the roads of HK today. It seems
    like a rare sight for some reason. We spent lunch at this expensive dim sum
    place with my mother’s church friend from her high school years in HK. He
    happens to be a taxi driver, and the last time we were w him (’87), my sister
    threw up in his car on the way down/up the Peak b/c she got carsick. </p>


  

<p>36 guests came out to my grandmother’s 80th birthday celebration. The bill
    came to a close $1720 CDN (works out to be $47 CDN + $4 CDN “lai see”/
    “hong bao”/ red pocket per guest). The cake (from Maxim’s) itself
    costed $1000 HKD ($200 CDN). What a rip-off, considering there was not much
    fruit-filling in the cake and the texture wasn’t all that good. I realised
    that wedding banquets must cost a fortune then considering that there is often
    a lot of guests, decorations, hired hands, and food and alcohol consumed.
  </p>


  

<p>That night, my dad killed a cockroach the length of my middle finger (at
    least and much fatter than that as well). Thankfully, that’s the first one
    I actually saw in the house. </p>


  

<p>Friday, August 31, 2001 </p>


  

<p>Yaay! We were finally returning to Vancouver today (as you can tell, I don’t
    like HK too much)! During the night, I ended up rolling off the couch and
    was about to hit the floor if my suitcase wasn’t in the way to block my fall.
    I think I rolled over in my sleep a bit too far b/c I was dreaming that I
    was twirling or something. </p>


  

<p>The plane ride back home was very turbulent. At one point, my stomach was
    doing flip-flops (because I felt like we kept falling), and so I started becoming
    paranoid when I saw the flight attendants actually strapped into theirs seats
    as well; I thought that we were going to die. In my paranoia, I decided to
    pray and ended up thinking of the results if I was to die. Somehow, I asked
    God to give me the opportunity to give me a chance to witness to my friend
    from high school even more. So, I guess I should taken whatever opportunity
    comes to me since we arrived in Vancouver 1 hour early :). </p>


  

<p>That’s my trip and this has been one long read (incomprehensive at times
    I’m sure). <br>
    Thanks for staying this far. 🙂 </p>


  

<p>Until next time, <br>
    This is L’il Miss Bo-Peep signing off.

		<p>				Day One-Wednesday, April 26th, 2000: New York, here I come!
    <br>
    On the night before my flight, I had to wake up at 6:00 a.m. with only 2 hours
    of sleep. One of my friends was kindly willing to wake up during the wee hours
    of the early morning to drive me from Waterloo, Ontario to the airport in
    Mrs. Sauga, Ontario, which took over a l’il o’er an hour. </p>


  

<p>My flight was at 10:00 a.m. and by the time we got to the airport, my stomach
    was feeling a l’il funny. It felt like the time at Winter Conference in Three
    Hills, Alberta, where we stayed up playing poker and I felt so sick on the
    bus ride and on the plane that I was on the verge of throwing up into my friend’s
    lap (but he didn’t know that . . . ;P). And also the time when my stomach
    felt funny right before I fainted in front of the washroom door, and then
    embarrassingly in front of Uncle Charles and Uncle Kai (and almost everyone
    of you, came to visit me in Pastor Joel’s office). This time, I didn’t even
    finish the apple fritter from Tim Hortons or my 50 cents bottled water from
    Costco, which was supposed to be my breakfast. All I did on the plane was
    sleep, ignoring the muffins and the drinks that they gave out. The plane seating
    arrangement was amazing! I think the plane itself was almost empty. Many weren’t
    squished at all. I had a whole row to myself-all three seats! I could’ve slept
    horizontally but I didn’t want to be the l’il kid that I already am. 🙂 </p>


  

<p>I imagine that the flight was 1 hr and 26 mins long and by the time I got
    there, it was a l’il past 11:30 a.m. My luggage came onto the carousel quite
    quickly and so did everyone else’s, and Vonne and her “uncle”(family
    friend), Uncle Peter, were already waiting for me. We drove from La Guardia,
    New York (from hereon termed, NY) to Short Hills, New Jersey (NJ) into a mall
    and ate at Johnny Rocket(s), a place like Mel’s Diner in Waterloo. Uncle Peter
    treated us. That mall is high class, perfect for HM people (that’s high maintenance
    for you)! We didn’t buy a single thing there because all it sold was DKNY,
    Guess, Gucci, Nine West, Jones NY, the list goes on and on. The washrooms
    were even a l’il too comfortable. Besides being clean, with 2-ply soft toilet
    paper, and softly thick good quality paper towels, there were couches for
    you to sit on (and you know what I discovered? It seems like sour-keys [the
    gummy sour candy] doesn’t exist in the States. I tried looking all over NY
    and NJ for them but to no avail). </p>


  

<p>OH yeah! I definitely recommend this book, which I found in the mall at Short
    Hills, to Carey (a.k.a. “Liang Chai”). He is a HS friend of mine
    (don’t ask me what HS means [and it doesn’t mean ‘high school’ in this context]
    but it definitely applies to him if you know him): The Gas We Pass. I think
    I will buy it from Amazon using my $100 gift certificate (to see the reviews,
    please go to: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0916291529/qid%3D957323133/103-7444639-9361461" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0916291529/qid%3D957323133/103-7444639-9361461</a>).
    Because the reviews are so good, I might also even get Everyone Poops, All
    About Scabs, The Hole in Your Nose, or Breasts . . . </p>


  

<p>At 6:15 p.m., Uncle Peter came and picked us up from the mall (b/c he went
    to work after we had lunch) and we went home to Morristown (keep in mind that
    Vonne’s uncle’s place is Morristown and not Moorestown where my relatives
    are). We proceeded to go grocery shopping for our breakfasts, which consisted
    of cranberry-orange muffins, creamcheese and bagel, and of course, Tropicana
    OJ (that’s orange juice, not OJ Simpson). </p>


  

<p>Dinner was extravagant (in a university student’s eyes), a seafood dinner
    worth at least $25 Canadian at a local restaurant. Once again, he treated.
    Vonne and I soon realized that a meal with Uncle Peter would cost that much
    and it wasn’t a big deal for him. I had so much seafood within the 4 days
    in NY! He even was going to treat us to Miss Saigon ($40 USD) but Vonne didn’t
    let him (that’s another story for later)J. By the time we got home that night,
    it was quite late so we unpacked and planned for the following day, I watched
    the Simpsons on Fox, and called it a night. </p>


  

<p>Day Two-Thursday, April 27th, 2000: Uptown, NY </p>


  

<p>Yawn, what an early morning. Vonne set her alarm to wake us up at 7:05 a.m.
    instead of 8:35 a.m. by accident. So I “opened” the lamp, thinking
    that it was time for us to get up, and thinking that a light in a dark basement
    would sure wake Vonne up. 5 minutes later, when I turned to look at the clock,
    it said 7:05 a.m., so I woke Vonne up and made her change the alarm to 8:35
    a.m. When it really was 8:35 a.m., we woke up and got ready to catch the train
    to NY. We got out of the house by 9:55 a.m. and practically had to run to
    catch the 10:10 a.m. train. By the time we got there, it just pulled up to
    the station. I think Uncle Peter had forgotten that we weren’t marathon runners
    like he was, so he didn’t take into account that we walk relatively slow.
    I’ve never been in a passenger train before, with real conductors and all,
    but I imagine that this was similar to Lower Mainland’s Westcoast Express
    but less fancy. It cost us $10.25 round trip NJ-NY. It brought us to Penn
    (short for Pennsylvania) Station near Madison Square Garden. From there, we
    walked to the Empire State Building and waited in line for hours. First, to
    buy tickets (the CityPass was for 6 attractions for the price of $32.00, which
    would save us 50% in comparison to purchasing them separately), then to line
    up to go up to the 86th floor and to the 107th floor observation decks. By
    the time we finished, we had spent at least 3 hrs in that building alone.
    My recommendation for future visitors is to go there early, and don’t go on
    the week of Spring Break (for NY/NJ non-post-secondary students). We took
    a lot of pictures so when we develop them, we’ll tell you more stories. </p>


  

<p>Walking from the Empire State Building to Times Square didn’t take us too
    long, although there were a number of streets. There were many stores to distract
    us along the way. Especially one in particular, The Disney Store. I spent
    most of my “souvenir(s)” money in those stores alone J. Times Square
    was bigger than I imagined it to be, with flashy lights and HDTV ads! Vonne
    and I were really good at hiding the fact that we were visitors. We would
    hide in the corner of stores to look at the map and took pictures only in
    tourist attractions, rarely, if ever, on the streets. After a lunch at McDonald’s,
    we discovered precious treasure! </p>


  

<p>The visitor’s information center in Times Square had a YAHOO! Internet terminal.
    There was actually a line-up for people to surf the net, and to check e-mail
    on 5 terminals. The sixth terminal took your photo and sent it to the e-mail
    address that you specified. Both Vonne and I now think that it’s a gimmick,
    because we had sent two, both on separate days, and nothing has arrived in
    our inboxes since. We hypothesize that they just want your e-mail addresses
    to add to their mass “junk” e-mail list. We are both very disappointed
    🙁 . </p>


  

<p>After spending enough time doing our e-mailing and photo-taking, we decided
    to saunter off to Rockefeller Plaza. My sister’s friend wanted a Conan O’Brien
    cap, so we decided to go wander around the NBC store to try and find a clean
    cap for him. Well, there wasn’t one, but I bought it anyway, considering he
    really wanted it, and it wasn’t my money anyway :). On our way, we passed
    St. Patrick’s Cathedral, a big Catholic church where they allow visitors to
    go in, make a candle offering, pray, or even take pictures and tour the building.
    We have some pictures of that too. What I noticed however, was that Catholics
    don’t remind me of Protestant/Evangelical Christians (what Vonne and I are)
    at all. They have so many statues and pictures and stuff to pray to and make
    candle offerings to, that it doesn’t make any sense, which saddens me. </p>


  

<p>By the time we were done, we had to catch the train back to NJ. So we walked,
    no, ran back to Penn Station (because we kind of walked too slowly in the
    beginning). We had plenty of exercise for the day. Dinner? Well, it was kind
    of with the late lunch we had, but we bought a Cajun chicken burger at McDonald’s
    for $1 each and ate it at home, along with some ice cream, chips, Tropicana,
    and mango. We planned for Friday, and went to bed. </p>


  

<p>Day Three-Friday, April 28th, 2000: Downtown, NY </p>


  

<p>We woke up earlier than the last so we could catch the train from Summit?/Harrison?,
    NJ to the ferry in Hoboken?/Newark?, NJ. Maybe Vonne would remember, because
    I think she still has the maps. Thankfully, we decided to take the train to
    the ferry instead of to Penn Station like the previous day, because there
    was a derailment that morning, and all trains went to the ferry terminal anyway.
    If we were to go uptown from the ferry point the previous day, we’d be completely
    lost. I think that God kept a close watch over us, and gave us everything
    to our advantage including sunshine. Apparently, there hasn’t been a sunny
    weekend (and following week) in 6 weeks J! The 1-way trip on the train costed
    us $5.00 and the ferry was $2.00. We ended up being very lost at first because
    we forgot the map at home L, but thankfully, we managed to pick up a map of
    the financial district on our accidental tour of the New York Stock Exchange.
  </p>


  

<p>The NY Stock Exchange was crazy. I haven’t seen anything like it. I wish
    that we had time to sneak a peek at Nasdaq (as RIMM has kept my interest in
    stocks recently). At the NY Stock Exchange, one was only allowed to view 2
    floors-the natural gas and the gold/silver trading. Going in, we had no idea
    what was happening. We could hear them even though we were viewing behind
    a glass. They all looked like l’il boys screaming and yelling at each other.
    Yep, we didn’t see any women there at all. But that doesn’t mean that there
    aren’t any doing that as their occupation; they’re just the minority. These
    people were circling pits and giving hand signals (wave in means buy, and
    wave out means sell) and trying to communicate to each other. It’s all a matter
    of eye contact and mutual agreement. I would never want to do this! Too aggressive
    and too stressful for me. </p>


  

<p>Heh-heh, we went to Barnes & Noble, an American bookstore, much like
    Chapters (and yes, Chapters is Canadian because I haven’t seen one in the
    States yet, although I haven’t seen Indigo yet either). The reason? To look
    at the map to Uptown, NY, mainly to Chinatown. We memorized the streets that
    we should turn at J. Chinatown in NY is big, but there isn’t much to do there
    unless you want to buy some fruits and veggies and such. Apparently, it’s
    one of the dirtiest Chinatowns around but I guess that since I’m so used to
    the streets of HK, the streets didn’t really appall me. However, the smells
    did remind me of HK. But then again, certain parts of Uptown, NY did too.
  </p>


  

<p>We met up with Vonne’s high-school friend Stella and her boyfriend, Michael
    (?) for lunch in a café in Chinatown. The red-bean ice was really good
    because the ice was actually crushed! Vonne and I were once again treated
    for lunch, this time by Stella’s boyfriend (you know what? We realized that
    if we had paid for all our meals, we would had gone over our budget long before
    our departure home. In fact, Vonne had budgeted just enough to take the shuttle
    bus to JFK airport from Newark. We were quite fortunate! God really took care
    of us and blessed us on this trip! :). </p>


  

<p>Those two ended up taking us to SoHo (meaning South of Houston-a street),
    an artsy, cultural community (supposedly), but we didn’t see too much there
    except for this one paper shop. This particular store sold everything paper:
    paper by the sheet, even by the pound. Mind you, this isn’t ordinary recycled
    or laser copying paper, there was so much selection of colours, weight, size,
    and texture of the paper, that the choices were endless. The stuff that I
    was looking for in order to do the grad invitations for CCF were all here.
    Unfortunately, most of the papers were quite expensive K. Ah, oh well, the
    invitations were done well with what we had, and with the assistance of Vonne
    anyway J. </p>


  

<p>We were going to take the subway uptown again, but we decided to just walk
    around downtown in case we had to rush to catch the train again. So we ventured
    into another cathedral (I think it was called Trinity Cathedral) that looked
    similar than St. Paddy’s (as Uncle Peter likes to call it). We also found
    a store that Stella and her boyfriend recommended called Century 21 (no, it’s
    not the real estate company). It’s a department store that sells all brand-name
    stuff at a discounted price. Stella said that we wouldn’t buy anything, but
    Michael (?) guessed that we would. Well, I was going to by a Pierre Cardin
    ($7 USD) leather wallet for my brother, but I didn’t afterall because I wasn’t
    sure if he’d like it or not. But, Vonne after much deliberation, bought a
    Hush Puppies wallet for her mother (so nice of her :)!). However, we ended
    up running to catch the PATH train ($1 USD-isn’t the fare more than quite
    reasonable?) back to NJ to meet up with Uncle Peter for dinner. We somehow
    seemed to have walked past the World Trade Center to Battery Park until we
    realized that we missed a turn. On top of that, we hadn’t taken a PATH train
    yet, so we had to run to find where to go down to take the train and which
    track it left on. Thankfully, we made it on time! J </p>


  

<p>Dinner was in Newark at a Spanish restaurant. We ate dinner with Uncle Peter
    and his older sister, Auntie Betty, and her husband, Uncle Bob (?). More seafood
    for yet another evening, but this time, I was rather cautious about eating
    the Atlantic lobster. In Waterloo, I had broken out into a rash due to a still
    unknown reason, and I had thought that perhaps it may have been the Atlantic
    lobster from Red Lobster the night before. Vonne and I split a HUGE marina
    meal that we didn’t finish. It had clam, mussels (many!), shrimp, scallops,
    and a small lobster tail. That was close to $20.00 USD and I was already feeling
    bad for eating such a big meal. The adults had lobster meals worth $25+ USD.
    Auntie Betty and Uncle Bob(by?) treated us thankfully, or else I would be
    heartbroken over a meal worth $20 that I would have to pay for. But then again,
    we split it so it was only around $10. </p>


  

<p>That evening, we tried rushing to the top of the World Trade Center in NY
    (oh yeah, I can’t believe that they charge you $4.50 USD for the toll to NY
    from NJ every time!) but it was already closed. That’s okay though because
    we were going to L’il Italy anyway (a l’il ways from Chinatown) to eat dessert.
    Vonne had strawberry shortcake and I had a raspberry cheesecake and Uncle
    Peter had a very tasteful Italian dessert. Once again, he treated. It was
    quite late by the time we got home, so we went to bed to rest up for yet another
    day. </p>


  

<p>Day Four-Saturday, April 29th, 2000: Museums and Miss Saigon </p>


  

<p>The day with Uncle Peter. First, we went to Times Square, NY to buy discounted
    matinee tickets. Actually, Uncle Peter stood in line, and he let us wander
    around. What we ended up doing was going back to the visitor’s information
    centre to send another e-photo. However, we still haven’t received anything
    from YAHOO! or from Burger King yet (that’s the story for Sunday)-I think
    that I should e-mail YAHOO! and ask them if I don’t see anything soon. Uncle
    Peter ended up waiting for us because the line went through very quickly.
    He got us seats close to each other (Vonne and I were next to each other,
    and Uncle Peter ended up moving next to us after the intermission because
    there was nobody beside Vonne) in the Orchestra section for a mere $40 USD
    (50% off original price). </p>


  

<p>Hmm, I think that it was about time for lunch, so Vonne and I shared 8 pieces
    of Popeye’s fried chicken and we were so full that we had to ask Uncle Peter
    to finish one piece for us, and Vonne didn’t even finish her extra side of
    potatoes. Ah, oh well J. 2:00 p.m. was the showing for Miss Saigon, so we
    went to watch our very first musical/Broadway show (except Uncle Peter, whose
    first one was Chorus Line). The show was quite good. I think I wouldn’t mind
    spending some more money for future shows. </p>


  

<p>After 2 hrs and ½ of the Broadway show, we tried to find LOAW Schwarz
    . . . (or something like that). Apparently, it’s supposedly the world’s largest
    toy store-the idea in Toy Story 2, and the store in Home Alone (1 or 2 I forget
    which). On the way, another Disney Store kind of distracted us. Inside, there
    were more souvenirs to buy, and more sales than the previous store (the goods
    of the sale were all gone the following day, when Vonne wanted to buy other
    stuff at the same store, so we were at the right place at the right time).
  </p>


  

<p>We proceeded to walk through Central Park (also featured in one of the Home
    Alone’s when he finds the pigeon lady) to go to the Metropolitan Museum of
    Art. This museum is huge and quite interesting, but I think I enjoyed the
    Intrepid or the Museum of Natural History more (which is a story for the following
    day). There wasn’t much time after we wandered through the museum, so we quickly
    tried to catch a cab to the World Trade Center so that we could view the city
    during the night. We only had approximately 15 mins by the time we got up
    there, so we were in quite a rush. Thus, we missed the stimulated helicopter
    ride (whatever that was) of NY and we missed some photo opportunities in the
    WTC. </p>


  

<p>We took the PATH train back to Harrison, where we parked in the morning.
    Funny, that morning, we inserted only 3 hrs and 45 mins worth of quarters
    (which gives you 15 mins per quarter) in the meters, when we should have paid
    for 7 hrs. We decided to risk the approximate 4 hrs until we saw that many
    tickets were issued to cars that had meters expired along the way (Vonne’s
    uncle lost some confidence in the risk). We then discovered that one could
    park all day for $3.00 close-by, so we gave up 3 hrs and 45 mins (and perhaps
    even a parking ticket) to park all day :). That night, we ended up having
    thin-crust pizza at home for dinner. </p>


  

<p>Day Five-Sunday, April 30th, 2000: Last day in NY! </p>


  

<p>Uncle Peter drove us to the pier where the Harbor Cruiseline left. Yep, we
    took a 2-hr cruise (from 11:30 a.m.) of NY Island. On the way, we passed the
    Statue of Liberty, many of NY’s bridges, and the skyline of NY, which included
    the Empire State Building, the Chrysler Building, the Financial District,
    etc. We took many pictures, which we hope will turn out quite nicely :). </p>


  

<p>After docking, we went next door to the Intrepid museum, which is a retired
    aircraft carrier that fought in 2 wars, including WWII (because a couple of
    the ship crew are working there now), which survived bombed injuries. Aboard
    that ship was a very sleek US spy plane and beside it was the only missile-guided
    submarine that visitors were allowed to tour. However, because the line up
    was so long (first it was 50 mins, then it was 1 hr and 15 mins), we decided
    to pass up the opportunity. Too bad L. Sometimes, I wonder why Canada doesn’t
    have more of these. It’s so fun to climb aboard a war ship! In my lifetime,
    the only ones I’ve been on is in the States; I’ve seen one docked by Westminster
    Quay, BC, but I don’t even know if they open that one up for visitors. We
    took many pictures too-silly ones. Unfortunately, the spy plane was at a bad
    angle so we couldn’t get a picture of it. </p>


  

<p>We rushed to the next museum via subway. But we made a detour on the way.
    Burger King for lunch with one slight distraction. An e-video and Internet
    terminal! Woo-hoo :)! So after checking our e-mails, we took 2 e-videos and
    sent them out. Once again, they haven’t arrived in our inboxes yet, so I think
    I will e-mail Adobe soon to complain. Due to our stop, we were late in arriving
    at the Museum of Natural History so we got in for free and ran around for
    ½ hr prior to closing to take as many pics as possible J. In an amazing
    amount of time, we went through 4 floors of displays and managed to get a
    general glimpse of the museum. </p>


  

<p>The subway station was right beside the Museum of Natural History, so we
    took the subway to the Museum of Modern Art, but by the time we got there,
    ’twas closed. It closes on 5:45 p.m. on Sundays, you see. Ah, oh well. We
    went to the Disney Store instead, and on the way back, we passed by some stores
    to pick up more postcards and to see if we could find Vonne a Miss Saigon
    souvenir. Well, she almost bought a T-shirt. </p>


  

<p>Notice that I said “almost”. Why? Well, because we got scared.
    We casually ventured inside a boutique, and all of a sudden, we heard screams
    and shouts, and then what looked like the beginnings of a fist-fight right
    outside the store. Even the store manager, an elderly Chinese lady went out
    to try and break it up, so we knew that it involved the store. We couldn’t
    go anywhere, because 2 other ladies were blocking the only exit. So, me, having
    watched too many movies and read too many books, pulled Vonne behind the pillar
    in case anyone started shooting. Silly me J. Well, anyway, Vonne saw an opportunity
    to escape out of the store when the 2 ladies escaped in a hurry. So we all
    rushed out the store and the ladies said that as much as they wanted the shawl,
    they were not going back there to get it. And as much as we wanted to buy
    the T-shirt, we were not going back there either 🙁 . </p>


  

<p>Anyway, all that commotion and searching for a Miss Saigon shirt made us
    almost late for the train again, so we practically sprinted to the subway
    station (well, speed-walked) and connected to the PATH train, just as it was
    arriving. Dinner? Er, I forget what we had. I think it was a mixture of lunch
    and the food we ate at home. Oh yeah! Vonne was hungry, so we dug out some
    microwaveable frozen pasta (which looked like airplane food but tasted much
    better) from Uncle Peter’s freezer. That night, we ended up watching a very
    old episode of Friends before packing our luggage and going to sleep (which
    was very late relative to our vacation schedule-past 2:00 a.m.). </p>


  

<p>Day Six-Monday, May 01st , 2000 to Day Twelve-Sunday, May 07th, 2000: NJ!
  </p>


  

<p>Arrived in Moorestown, NJ late morning. Had buffet lunch. Shopped at Christian
    bookstore. Every day thereafter: </p>


  

<p>· Shopping (everywhere including craft stores) <br>
    · Eating (including a meal at Red Lobster [my second time there in
    my life!] on Friday, May 05th, 2000-yummy, more seafood!) <br>
    · Sleeping <br>
    · Reading (Phillip Yancey’s: What’s So Amazing About Grace; The Bible
    Jesus Read-both very good books!) <br>
    · Beading (my new hobby J) <br>
    · Playing (piano, with cousins, etc.) <br>
    · E-mailing/writing my journal (the copy you see here) <br>
    · Relaxing </p>


  

<p>Key Highlight(s): Thursday, May 04th, 2000: ILOVEYOU virus breaks out, and
    many people I know get infected. For additional details of this virus, please
    refer to: <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/sections/tech/DailyNews/virus_000505.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://abcnews.go.com/sections/tech/DailyNews/virus_000505.html</a>
  </p>


  

<p>The End. </p>


  

<p>P.S. Thanks for your patience and time in reading this long (and probably
    boring report) of my trip. Hope you enjoyed at least 0.0001% of it :P!</p>

		<p>				Note to my friends who have been praying for me during my
    trip in Hong Kong: THANKS 🙂 </p>


  

<p>Day One: Monday, August 10, 1998 (Pacific Standard Time); Tuesday, August
    11, 1998 (Hong Kong Time Zone)<br>
    8:45 am: Becky Chan telephones my sister to say good-bye to her before she
    leaves for work. That is my wake-up call. 5 minutes later, my sister comes
    into my room to tell me to wake up and get ready to leave as my father had
    relayed the message to Sheila in the middle of Becky’s call. That’s what BC
    Tel’s call waiting is for I guess. </p>


  

<p>I don’t remember when we arrived at the airport but we got there safely.
    Pastor Joshua accompanied us as he was going to take our van back to our house
    for us. After we had checked-in with Air Canada, we had time for some lunch
    as we knew the plane food wasn’t going to be that pleasant. My family had
    Burger King and some Fortune Wok (or some kind of Wok food) . . .I on the
    other hand couldn’t eat anything but an apple because ever since Saturday,
    I had encountered a stomach virus (accompanied by a fever) and whenever I
    ate, the food didn’t stay in my digestive tract for very long (not that you
    wanted to know). I shall spare you the details, but let’s just say that I’m
    thankful that I didn’t vomit because I hate vomiting. </p>


  

<p>The A343 plane lifted-off approximately at 1:00 p.m. I barely got a chance
    to sleep on the plane. I had prayed beforehand that my stomach would last
    until I got off the plane and God answered another prayer! When I was completely
    healed was another thing, another day. Perhaps that was why my appetite wasn’t
    that big (it was God’s doing)–I only had 8 slices (or pieces) of Premium
    Plus crackers and hot water as I couldn’t eat any of the plane food (thank
    goodness, though the sushi sure looked good). I didn’t even have enough appetite
    to eat the apple that we bought at the airport last minute that totaled to
    (all currency is in Canadian) $1.00. </p>


  

<p>13 hours and 22 minutes. What a long plane ride, but to pass much of the
    time, they showed some TV sitcoms: Seinfield, Spin City, some documentary
    on American lobsters, CBC News, some music videos, and 4 movies (Aerovision
    Movie Presentations): The Lucky Guy (some Chinese movie), Sliding Doors, Wag
    The Dog (I thought that Wag the Dog was about a dog, not politics!), and The
    Real Howard Spitz. They weren’t supposed to show The Real Howard Spitz but
    I guess they had too much time on their hands. They had music to listen to
    as well, and my sister found a Christian Contemporary and Gospel music station
    with songs from Avalon, DC Talk, Amy Grant, Michael W. Smith, Jars of Clay,
    and other artists I haven’t heard of–they were the gospel songs. </p>


  

<p>The Hong Kong International airport was a big place! They had electronic/computerized
    trains that ran from one part of the airport to the other (probably because
    it would’ve taken too long to walk from one end to the other. However there
    were many things that were still in the process of repair/construction (e.g.
    a moving sidewalk). I also wanted to find the places where they had shiny
    marbled floor tiles that when one looked down, (s)he could see the reflection
    of people walking. If someone was wearing a skirt, one could’ve seen beneath
    it. I didn’t come across one then, but on the way back I inspected it and
    I could see my reflection quite clearly. Thank goodness that I wasn’t wearing
    a skirt, just jeans. </p>


  

<p>It took us 1.5 hours to get home in traffic. We could’ve taken a taxi that
    would’ve come to $60-$80 or an electric train and then transferred to the
    MTR (subway transit) but that was too inconvenient. The double decker bus
    fare for the family was $30. </p>


  

<p>After we arrived, our grandfather (you see only he was there because my aunt
    and her kids went to China and my grandmother and my uncles were in Guam)
    took us out to dinner but all I had was plain rice because I still couldn’t
    eat properly (yum). By the time we got home, it was nearly 10 p.m. but even
    though it’s not that late, we were all really tired so we went to bed really
    soon. </p>


  

<p>
    Day Two: Wednesday, August 12, 1998 (Hong Kong Time Zone)<br>
    6:59 am: Pitter-patter . . .drip, drip, drip . . .the pouring rain woke me
    up so I got up to adjust the air-conditioner. My brother also woke up so we
    turned on the television to see if there were any Chinese cartoons on. However,
    the only program that kept coming on was the morning news, which kept rerunning
    even up to 8:30 am when we went to wash-up and have breakfast. </p>


  

<p>Because everyone woke up so early, we decided to go out and walk around to
    see if there were any shops nearby that were open. You wouldn’t believe it
    if I told you that none of the shops open until 10:30 am at the earliest (but
    they close at 9:30 p.m. or later every night)! We had dim sum at 3 p.m. because
    we had to clean our apartment (it was just newly renovated). We then proceeded
    into probably one of the largest HMVs in Hong Kong (and perhaps the world).
    It had four stories with different types of music located on each floor. At
    the time, there was a “crazy sale” so we decided to look to see
    if there were any CDs that were by contemporary Christian artists. Since there
    was no alphabetical order of the artists names in the sale racks, we had to
    spend quite a bit of time flipping through each CD before coming across the
    Newsboys single, ‘Take Me To Your Leader’ and Steven Curtis Chapman’s, ‘Signs
    of Life’ (I think my brother found both of them). My sister purchased the
    Newsboys CD that had 5 songs on it including the ‘Shine’ remix ($2) and I
    purchased the Steven Curtis Champman one ($10). </p>


  

<p>In the afternoon, we got a chance to watch a Chinese cartoon ‘Ding Dong’
    or otherwise known as ‘Doramoen’ (spelling?). . . I think it was until our
    aunt invited us to dinner in Hong Kong Island (we live in Tsim Sha Tsui, Kowloon).
    We took the Star Ferry across the ocean/sea (?) and had dinner (which I decided
    to take a chance and eat real food–big mistake). Their apartment is considered
    to be one of the “well-off” luxurious ones. It had 4 bedrooms, 2
    bathrooms including full bathtubs and showers with gas-heated hot water tanks,
    1 big storage area/closet, a huge dining table, leather couches, cabled TV
    (my grandparents don’t own these you see), and a DVD/karoake machine (and
    I forgot also a hired maid). They even are members of certain clubs (you know,
    places where you may use the facilities for approximately $1000 a year). That
    night, the three of us (kids) got a chance to stay overnight and I finally
    decided to suffer and take this disgusting bitter tasting Chinese medicine
    (which contains 50% alcohol, metholaumem, distilled water, cloves, nutmeg,
    and other ingredients) in hopes of ridding that awful reaction I got after
    eating (well, I think it must’ve worked because I was pretty much okay the
    following day). </p>


  

<p>
    Day Three: Thursday, August 13, 1998 (Hong Kong Time Zone)<br>
    Um, yeah so I was going on and on about what happened but my screen froze
    and I had to start all over again (from Day 3 to Day 4) and at the same time
    I am watching The Devil’s Advocate so I am really distracted. Anyway, I seemed
    to have misplaced my notes until the end of summer and it was not until now
    (December 19, 1998) that I am finishing my journal. So that morning, I woke
    up at 10 am to the noise of the kids talking. I spent most of my time being
    bored that day because my cousins had a private tutor over. However, we got
    a chance to go to the stationary store nearby and I got a chance to buy some
    signo milky pens for a good price. That night, we went back across the harbour
    (via the Star Ferry) and went to a restaurant to eat dinner with my mother’s
    relatives. My, were the dishes ever small!!!!! Never seen such like them!
  </p>


  

<p>
    Day Four: Friday, August 14, 1998 (Hong Kong Time Zone)<br>
    After breakfast that morning, our family decided to go the science centre
    except it was closed. You see, we have a family membership at Science World
    and so there is free admission to other science centres around the world.
    Because the science centre was still closed, we walked around for awhile.
    My sister, being Sheila, who loves to shop (unlike myself), bought many clothes
    while I just bought a purse (a purse? I thought it was stickers!) Anyway,
    we went to the most non-Chinese place in the world for lunch: McDonald’s.
    However, the iced lemon tea in the McDonald’s are only found in Hong Kong
    (well not here anyway). A McCrunch was the latest trend (some pork burger)
    so that is what I had. We proceeded to go to Tom Lee and we ended up buying
    the latest hits music for the piano, flute, trumpet except the music were
    not all in the same key which I didn’t know then ~ oh well. We finally went
    back to the science centre and quickly looked around-4 floors and I’m sure
    some of you know that already since I was there in 1993-and went home for
    the night. </p>


  

<p>
    Day Five: Saturday, August 15, 1998 (Hong Kong Time Zone)<br>
    The adults had a meeting so the kids were stuck downstairs in a room drawing
    and reading and stuff. Wasn’t my idea of fun but for dim sum, we were able
    to pick what kind of food we wanted =) and so it was good for once! More shopping
    afterwards. Again. The dinner that night was great. Well, it was hilarious.
    We got stuck with some other kids that were staying with my father’s relatives
    at our own table. They were so annoying at first and they wouldn’t talk to
    us. Anyway, after one kid threw a napkin and hit a man in the face (sitting
    next to our table), he cried. I didn’t feel sorry for him even though the
    man got so angry. I thought he deserved it. Apparently, my cousin did and
    she went and tried to cheer him up. Soon enough, he was laughing tears if
    you know what I mean. And once again, they didn’t believe I was 18. Seriously,
    who does?! One of the girls on my floor when they saw me thought that I was
    16-yeah a genius. I wish. After our very interesting evening, we went home
    and since it was my third uncle’s birthday, we served him cake. That night
    I think I went to bed early because the next day we had Sunday service at
    8:30 am at the Tsim Sha Tsui Baptist Church which I went to 5 years ago too.
  </p>


  

<p>
    Day Six: Sunday, August 16, 1998 (Hong Kong Time Zone)<br>
    English service with organ worship and hymns except for Majesty is very different.
    The chairperson doing the announcements was Caucasian but yet it was so impressive
    cuz he was translating from a Chinese printed bulletin! Mom, Sheila and I
    met up with my fourth aunt (the same one who has such a luxurious house) and
    went shopping some more. I finally had a chance to drink some bubble tea ~
    mmmmmmm . . .it’s so good! Is it only this good in Hong Kong?! Anyway, did
    I ever mention that Hong Kong has this really crazed fad with Hello Kitty?
    It was really annoying. And I tried some “stinky” tofu-it’s not
    as great as what everyone says it is. It’s kinda sour tasting. Oh, we also
    went to buy some shoes for me. The salespeople all thought that I was not
    more than 14. One of them didn’t believe that even though my mother told him.
    Sheesh. So I ended up buying (or my mother ended up buying for me) shoes,
    jacket, and I bought a $5 nice T, some more pens. How come I don’t remember
    eating at a Thai cuisine for dinner? Oh well, if my notes say so then I guess
    that is what we did. And we took the ever so expensive but-not-as-expensive-as-Vancouver-I-don’t-think
    taxi home. </p>


  

<p>
    Day Seven: Monday, August 17, 1998 (Hong Kong Time Zone)<br>
    This Monday was a very special day for Hong Kong because it was supposedly
    the date that China chased Japan outta their country or something. Anyway,
    we woke up at 7:30 am because the family was going to meet my mother’s friend
    for an early dim sum. Apparently, that friend and his wife were going to see
    a movie afterwards, but I forgot which one it was. So we left them alone and
    our aunt came and took us shopping to help my mother buy a dress for the banquet.
  </p>


  

<p>As the time neared 3:00 p.m. I think (you see both my watches were out-of-order
    so I really have no sense of time), we decided to go to my aunt’s club for
    lunch. I thought since it was a club, the food would be pretty good so I decided
    to try a shepherd’s pie. Bad mistake! The pie was quite unappealing because
    it had so much spaghetti-kind meat in it but the orange juice sure tasted
    yummy! </p>


  

<p>In the late afternoon, we went home and the 3 girls (Sheila, Iris, and I)
    spent the rest of the afternoon picking out jewelry from my grandmother as
    she was very generous in giving away the jewelry she still had from the jewelry
    store they own previously. Dinner rolled by again but this time, we had to
    take the MTR (subway) to Mong Kok (but they pronounce it Wong Kok so I still
    haveta figure that one out). </p>


  

<p>That evening, the cousins all decided to practice the El Shaddai piece without
    the cassette player for awhile and one of the younger cousins also decided
    to incorporate a VBS song as well. However, since the cassette player wasn’t
    bought yet, he was going to teach it to us the following day. </p>


  

<p>At last!!! The hot water tank was finally working (the construction people
    were working at finishing the rest of the house during the day) so I was able
    to take a nice warm shower instead of in freezing (not quite but close to)
    water! =) And the ZZZZ!s came upon me. </p>


  

<p>
    Day Eight: Tuesday, August 18, 1998 (Hong Kong Time Zone)<br>
    Woke up. (duh). Sat around doing nothing after breakfast. Went to lunch with
    my “dai” aunt’s mother and father. Our family then went to a Chinese
    Christian bookstore. I was going to buy some Chinese memory verse cards that
    were relatively easy to read/understand but they were sold out and thus, I
    didn’t make a purchase at all. We went to a China store (i.e. a store with
    stuff from China not made out of China) and I think my mother bought a pair
    of shoes there. Formal family pictures were taken at a studio far away. I
    am not patient at those things, they are too picky and they take waay too
    many pictures. By the time we got there, I was all sticky even though I just
    took a shower before leaving the house. Dinner was at 9 p.m. (grrr so hungry
    by then). Dry thunderstorm afterwards . . .and that was the interesting evening.
  </p>


  

<p>
    Day Nine: Wednesday, August 19, 1998 (Hong Kong Time Zone)<br>
    Yawn!!!!!!! We woke up early — but don’t ask me why we did that because I
    had forgotten that the science museum didn’t open until 1:00 p.m. and the
    art museum–who knows when that opened! Well, it’s kinda neat though because
    on Wednesdays, both museums are free! It was our grandparents’ 60th wedding
    anniversary so after breakfast, we practiced our performance songs: Oh God
    Loves You And Me and El Shaddai. Anyway that is to explain later. The art
    museum was very interesting and uninteresting at the same time. I don’t understand
    why they charge people money though, it’s not worth it and I wouldn’t go if
    I had to pay. The funny thing is at the gift shop they sell CDs that are supposed
    to be therapeutical such as a constipation-reliever. That is true! I am not
    lying! </p>


  

<p>Went to the restaurant early to practice our songs. My sister sang like never
    before and of course I was nothing in comparison (we both had solos for El
    Shaddai). During the banquet, the kids had our own table and my grandfather
    gave such a long speech in Chinese that I think everyone eventually got bored.
    Because it was the last night before my cousins were to leave, they came over
    and had a sleepover. </p>


  

<p>
    Day Ten: Wednesday, August 20, 1998 (Hong Kong Time Zone)<br>
    At 9 am we had to get up and “send” our cousins and their parents
    off. We shopped and we went to a music studio cuz my father’s uncle or something,
    wanted to give a violin to my brother because we were looking for one and
    he happened to overhear and so he offered one as a gift. Had dim sum with
    them and got to hear more interesting stories of his childhood. He is a very
    good storyteller. Shopped some more. Wow, so what else is new? </p>


  

<p>That is all I have down on paper, I think we left the day after. The End.
    Phew. <br>
    PS. Watched Titanic on the way back (on the plane) they had sensibly cut out
    the inappropriate parts. <br></p>

		<p>				A note to all readers: You do not need to reply to this unless
    you feel compelled to respond.</p>


  

<p>This is L’il Miss Bo-Peep reporting live from Calgary, Alberta. In this assignment,
    my journeys will be explained starting from day one to the day I arrived back
    in Surrey, British Columbia. </p>


  

<p>Weather: Edmonton/Calgary, Alberta: High 34 C Sunshine with occasional Prairie
    showers</p>


  

<p>Vancouver, British Columbia: High 18 C Heavy rain and overcast</p>


  

<p>Now which one would I prefer? Definitely this weather here! Imagine, I even
    got a tan/sock line on my journeys (and trust me, I don’t tan!). Gee, this
    weather is weird here–in the winter, it is so cold (even a Calgarian, Ollie
    admitted it) and in the summer it gets this hot!</p>


  

<p>Week One </p>


  

<p>Day One: Wednesday, July 30th, 1997 </p>


  

<p>Vancouver Time: </p>


  

<p>7:47 am The four headed out and after picking up Edelweiss sandwiches for
    lunch, we began our travels on Highway #1.</p>


  

<p>9:36 am Yaay! My “wild” cows were there again! Which reminds me,
    this ride out was much better than the ride to Kamloops and back (B.L.A.S.T.
    ’96). For one thing, I wasn’t stuck in the middle squished like a banana and
    another, there was no camera to take a picture of me sleeping. Besides all
    that, I had 14 hours to sleep, think, dream, daydream, snack, write, take
    bathroom breaks (not that you really wanted to know that), think and sleep
    some more. </p>


  

<p>10:15 am Was snoozing away when all of a sudden, somebody up front yells,
    “DEER!”. Gee, thanks for waking me up. I turned around but it was
    too late–I couldn’t see it ‘cuz it was too far behind.</p>


  

<p>11:03 am Welcome to Kamloops, British Columbia–Home of the Alanis Morissette
    twin and B.L.A.S.T. ’96. Pit stop for gas and bathroom break.</p>


  

<p>11:26 am Finally saw some sheep and horses.</p>


  

<p>11:35 am LUNCH: Guess what? Uh-huh, Edelweiss sandwiches in the car along
    with my fave, British Columbia ‘soft’ water. Mmm. . .thirst quenching!</p>


  

<p>11:49 am Saw some other animals: llamas that looked like camels with one
    lump (by the way, what are emus? I saw a sign that said that there were some
    for sale).</p>


  

<p>12:04 pm Saw some goats–first on this trip.</p>


  

<p>12: 15 pm Hmm, there was this horse that kinda looked strange. I gotta draw
    it out for you to see but the middle section was spotted like a dalmatian
    but the rest was brown.</p>


  

<p>3:44 pm Went past Mt. Robson and not too long after that, the Great Divide
    (ya know, the song that P.O.G. sings). Marie, ya know where I’m talking about
    right?</p>


  

<p>Some where in-between this time, we stopped at Jasper just to rest and see
    if I could find an inexpensive pair of clips that would fit my glasses.</p>


  

<p>Edmonton Time: (please note: Edmonton time is one hour ahead than Vancouver
    time)</p>


  

<p>6:57 pm Finally, some close up wildlife (this is wild for real this time).
    A family of mountain goats with 2 kids and one was crossing the highway.</p>


  

<p>7:03 pm Approximately 5 wild elk by the roadside except I don’t think they’re
    quite ‘wild’ anymore.</p>


  

<p>9:37 pm How odd! We passed a directional sign that pointed to Camp He Ho
    Ha. Why wasn’t it Camp Ha Ho He or Ho Ha He?</p>


  

<p>Day Two: Thursday, July 31st, 1997 </p>


  

<p>Of all things to do on the first day in Edmonton: SHOPPING! Sure, it had
    air conditioning and all but couldn’t we go shopping back home too?! Well,
    at least the merchandise (meaning clothes) is a lot cheaper here–ya can’t
    get much for 5 bucks in Vancouver. Here, I got a ribbed-tee for that price,
    a knitted jacket, and my aunt got a pair of Nike’s (new leather cross-trainers)
    for $7.49 without the GST. As well, we needed not to pay an extra 7% as PST.</p>


  

<p>Hey, in the middle of our shopping spree, we met up with ‘Dad’ and Doris,
    Grace, and Helen. Boy, was Helen ever excited about the wedding!</p>


  

<p>Day Three: Friday, August 01, 1997 </p>


  

<p>The second day in Edmonton was just like the first: SHOPPING! This time,
    we went to the West Edmonton Mall. Really, what is there to do there unless
    you plan on paying 30 bucks for the rides that seem pretty dangerous (especially
    when you know that a roller-coaster car there became detached once and killed
    some people)?</p>


  

<p>Day Four: Saturday. August 02, 1997 </p>


  

<p>Helen & Zeke’s (who’s real name is David or Dave for short) wedding!
    They looked so cute! PJ (aka Jim Cheung) was the officiator of the ceremony
    and Zeke was wearing his Edmonton police uniform as his outfit. I met up with
    Isaac Quan (aka ULCA Bruins) with some girl whom at first I thought was his
    girlfriend. He says ‘Hi’ to ya Marie.</p>


  

<p>The reception/banquet was very interesting. We had a multi-media production
    of how some couples met (Garry & Teresa, Richard & Susan, and ‘Dad’
    & Doris), some live entertainment from people like our very own Auntie
    Brenda (who sang Faithful Friend by Twila Paris and Steven Curtis Chapman),
    and dancing! The dancing part was fun for Sheila whom danced with Doris, Steve
    and everybody else doing the Macerena (spelling?). The fun part for me was
    standing out with Alex and Mike and just socializing with them and watching
    my sister have fun. However, this other song starts playing and Steve and
    Doris and Sheila drags me out to the dance floor. So I made a fool outta myself
    trying to dance.</p>


  

<p>Guess what? I’m now officially related to ‘Dad’ through Helen and Zeke. As
    well Marie, you and I will be a ‘sister’ to a new ‘younger sister/brother’
    pretty soon. Yup! ‘Dad’ and Doris will be real parents in half a year or so
    (expecting in late February). They are already 8 weeks in. Who thinks that
    the baby will be a girl? Doris and ‘Dad’ both want a girl but I think it will
    be a boy. Don’t forget to congratulate them next time you see them if you
    haven’t done so already! So, who’s next?</p>


  

<p>Oh yeah, and I just gotta tell you about this guy I sat beside with at the
    banquet (even though he is kinda ‘cute’ for a Regina person, don’t take this
    the wrong way). Before I tell you who he is, all of you should’ve met him
    before because Doris and ‘Dad’ have brought them to our ‘old’ BCAC before
    during the year of ’96 (No wonder he looked familiar at JMC!). He didn’t know
    me but I already knew what he looked like and who he was from JMC. Tim(othy)
    Wong is Caucasian but he looks more like a ‘blended’ kid. He’s adopted into
    a Chinese family so he knows how to read some Chinese and speak it as well.
    Pretty impressive I tell you. He came from Regina so ‘course he knows Rhoda,
    Jemia and even my school ‘friend’ Carol Wai. I found out that he is the same
    age as I am and we (Sheila, Tim and I–Josephine, his sister chickened out
    on us) ended up singing a song in front of everybody to get Helen and Zeke
    to K-I-S-S. The song? Our version of The Little Mermaid’s Kiss the Girl:</p>


  

<p>There you see her,<br>
    Sitting across from you.<br>
    Looking so beautiful,<br>
    You know she wants you.<br>
    She won’t say the words,<br>
    Not a single word,<br>
    Until you <br>
    Kiss the girl</p>


  

<p>Sha-la la la my oh my,<br>
    Time will fly,<br>
    Until you kiss the girl.<br>
    Or you will miss the girl.</p>


  

<p>
    Anyway, that was my day — the number one highlight of this trip — that was
    the main purpose of the trip anyway so I’m glad that I enjoyed it the most.
    Remember, next year on this very day is their first anniversary: it’s
    paper!</p>


  

<p>Day Five: Sunday, August 03, 1997 </p>


  

<p>Sunday Morning Service: 11:00 am</p>


  

<p>Edmonton Chinese Alliance Church (‘oy sing wah yun suen dao wui’)</p>


  

<p>Hey, I actually saw a person I knew there. ‘Course like the way I knew Tim,
    she didn’t even recognize me. Actually the only way I know her is through
    massive observations during JMC. I took note who was who and she stood out
    the most because she was from my floor and not to be mean or anything, she
    reminded me of a guy (her haircut) the first time I saw her in the ladies
    washroom. Daniel, thanks for talking to Hannah and silently confirming to
    me that she indeed was not a guy during JMC. Well, this time I knew that she
    was a girl for sure even if I hadn’t seen her at JMC because she was wearing
    a dress. All right, who knows which church Jonathan Lim (or was it Lin) goes
    to (in case you need refreshing, he was at WC ’96)? I know I couldn’t get
    a chance to call him even if I wanted to because he was in Malaysia (or was
    it Hong Kong?).</p>


  

<p>After service, we went to Helen and Zeke’s gift opening at their ‘new’ place.
    There I found out one thing that was very interesting, Tim Wong is actually
    related to ‘Dad’ in a way too which means I’m ‘related’ to so many people
    that it’s beginning to get confusing (but it’s neat to think about it). Now
    you see why I told you not to think anything was going on before. </p>


  

<p>That night in Edmonton, we went to Cheesecake’s Cafe for dessert and boy,
    I saw this huge Black Forest cake and right away, I thought, ‘Boy, would Daniel
    love to eat this!’ The cake was at least 5 inches high and 2 inches wide per
    slice. It came with fresh whipped cream and with what looked like real cherry
    filling and chocolate filings sprinkled on top. I didn’t order that ‘cuz I
    figured that if I was here at a cheesecake place, I should order cheesecake–and
    yup, I ended up ordering a raspberry-peach cheesecake. Mmm. . .</p>


  

<p>On that night, I discovered a mosquito bite! Aagh! It itched like crazy and
    all that calamine lotion did not help it one bit! Maybe I got it from gazing
    up in the night sky looking at the Big Dipper and catching a glimpse of a
    falling star (it was probably a falling satellite though).</p>


  

<p>Day Six: Monday, August 04, 1997 </p>


  

<p>Did I ever tell you that there are some theatres like A Theatre Near You
    here in Edmonton? The movies that were showing there at that time included
    Jurassic Park: The Lost World, A Simple Wish, Liar! Liar!, and Speed II: Cruise
    Control. The daily matinees are for $1.50 (don’t forget, it is without PST
    too!), evenings are for $2.00 and midnight shows are for $3.00. Tuesdays are
    the best deal–for the whole day, it costs only $1.00 for a movie!</p>


  

<p>Anyway, we started this day off with breakfast at some place with Kitty &
    Kevin this time. It served pancakes as big as the plate and it was very filling!</p>


  

<p>Guess where we went next? For those who guessed SHOPPING, congratulations!
    You deserve a shopping award! We went to Winners and got some more clothes
    and to Staples to buy myself another purple pen (another good deal). I also
    wanted to go to Blessings Christian Marketplace but they had already driven
    me to the places my sister and I wanted to go and they were very tired (and
    I think bored).</p>


  

<p>After we got tired of shopping and when the sun decided to ‘calm’ down for
    a bit, we decided to check out Heritage Day at a park in Edmonton. We thought
    that it was going to be very interesting ‘cuz everybody was talking about
    it but all it had was expensive food from different countries around the world
    and music. The Pacific National Exhibition Fair is much better even though
    we have to pay an admission fee to get in.</p>


  

<p>We ended up going golfing (well, semi-golfing) in the evening ‘cuz my uncle
    and his brother are golf fanatics. So I ended up being taught how to ‘drive’
    a golf ball. Well, really how to swing a golf stick (I don’t think that’s
    what you call ’em but I can’t think of the proper term for it right now) and
    hit a ball from the tee. I always thought that golf was boring, especially
    to watch it and well, after experiencing it, I still can’t see what the big
    ‘wow’ is even though it is less boring when you’re playing it.</p>


  

<p>Day Seven: Tuesday, August 05, 1997 </p>


  

<p>Most of you probably know that our family has a Science World membership.
    Being a member at Science World gives us many advantages, including getting
    into 180 different science centres around the world, which means I had to
    take advantage of that and get in for absolutely free at the Edmonton Space
    and Science Centre. Comparing with Vancouver’s own science centre, it is nothing!
    The only thing that was ‘better’ in a sense was the planetarium’s dome screen
    which proudly boasted to be the biggest and tallest in North America (well,
    Canada at least). So while my sister and I were roaming around there for 2
    hours, my aunt and uncle visited this dinky l’il museum that took 1 hour to
    find and 3 minutes to look at. I now see why that they only accepted ‘donations’.</p>


  

<p>Guess what? For those who knew that I said that we went SHOPPING again, you
    are right again! You deserve a ‘gold’ shopping award! We went into a quieter
    mall and that is where we got the Nike deal I mentioned before.</p>


  

<p>In the evening, we went to visit our family friend. They have this one girl
    who is in grade two and boy, she’s like this every time I see her, she is
    attached to me more than to anyone else. She showed me her room, drew me Sailor
    Mars (she’s into the ‘Sailor Girls’) before I left, played piano (her own
    composed songs that sounded so good — absolutely no dissonance!) for me,
    and got me to somehow help her with her Crayola ‘keepsakes’ craft. Boy, was
    I ever kept busy! She also talked non-stop!</p>


  

<p>In case I haven’t already mentioned and if you’re wondering what I did in-between
    the free time I had at home, I really did nothing . . .unless you count watching
    TV and playing cards a very interesting or an actual activity. We played so
    much cards that I got bored of Speed, Double Speed, Big 2, and Crazy Eight!
    I ended up playing some solitaire games ‘cuz I was too sick of those.</p>


  

<p>Week Two </p>


  

<p>Day Eight: Wednesday, August 06, 1997 </p>


  

<p>10:20 am I couldn’t believe that I was actually goin’ to Calgary. Somehow
    in the past few days, the Lord answered my prayers and people convinced my
    aunt to change her mind about Calgary.</p>


  

<p>10:31 am On the way, we passed this really neat incinerator in an oil refinery
    place and it looked like a large torch burning. From what I learned at Science
    AL!VE, if methane and methanol are similar, if anything passes through it,
    it will combust. </p>


  

<p>11:34 am Some of these directional signs are so weird! This one said, ‘Ma-Me-O-Beach’.
    Where do people come up with these names?</p>


  

<p>11:35 am We got stuck behind a truck that stank of manure! Belch!</p>


  

<p>12:20 pm We actually went into Red Deer for a bathroom break and a small
    snack. So that’s where Red Deer is–in-between Calgary and Edmonton.</p>


  

<p>Later on that day when we arrived in Calgary, we met up with UCLA Bruins
    again and we ended up having lunch together and I finally got access to my
    E-MAIL account! I was dying to use the computer before and finally, someone
    with access! I then called up my friends at Westside Calgary Alliance Church
    and talked to them a bit and I called Ollie up too (he’s goin’ to summer school,
    what a ‘geek’). Know what? PJ is teaching a bunch of ’em at Westside GUITAR
    on Wednesday nights at 6:30 pm! Now my friends know guitar more than I do!
    Anyway, I got a chance to meet up with them at the Wednesday Night Prayer
    Meeting at 7:30 pm and I saw Dawn, Selene, Maureen, Sol, Gabby, and the rest
    of ’em including some I haven’t met before (Ray, Jeff (Geoff?), Stephanie
    etc.). But I missed seeing some of the others ‘cuz they were either away or
    at work. I was having too much fun that I even forgot to get a pic of my closest
    friends there. Oh well. Know what? I rather like their prayer meetings! It’s
    a very exciting time. First there is a praise n’ worship time and then we
    divide into small groups of people (we get to choose), we share with the group
    and then we pray together. For some reason, it feels like I’m more ‘at ease’
    in that prayer meeting than the ones I’ve been to in GQ. Yup, they have a
    pretty ‘warm’ and ‘friendly’ group. If I had to move to Calgary, my number
    one choice would be Westside even though their church is very small (well,
    they’re expanding soon!). </p>


  

<p>Last night was definitely the second highlight of this trip. We ended up
    having a late dinner with PJ and Freda and they told us how they met and all
    and it was very interesting to be able to compare it with Henry and Lenis’
    as well! Their stories are so neat especially with Jim’s added sound effects
    to the story of how it happened. You gotta get Jim and Freda to tell it to
    ya the next time they come (which would likely be in the first week in September).</p>


  

<p>Day Nine: Thursday, August 09, 1997 </p>


  

<p>The last day in Calgary. In the late morning, we headed down to the Calgary
    Zoo. It was really big and a lot better than the old Stanley Park. In fact,
    UCLA Bruins told me that it was the biggest zoo in Canada. Well no wonder
    it’s better than Stanley Park, they charge you admission!</p>


  

<p>Hey, did you know that in Edmonton and Calgary they have the ETS (Edmonton
    Transit System/CT (Calgary Transit) LRT (Light Rail Transit) that’s just like
    our Skytrain? However, they charge you a bit more and it is run by an LRT
    operator on each train. Some of these trains use the regular railway as well
    (I guess kinda like the Westcoast Express eh?).</p>


  

<p>Anyway, we dropped by Chinatown for lunch and boy, people were right. It
    is nothing compared to Vancouver but it is very CLEAN! I’m sure Daniel would
    like this Chinatown better too. Right by Chinatown, there was an market that
    people claimed to the miniature version of Granville Island. It was more like
    a version of New Westminster Quay and Lonsdale Quay Public Market (I guess
    it’s kinda like Granville Island’s Public Market too) but there was really
    nothing too see at the Eau Claire Market.</p>


  

<p>We went back to PJ and Freda’s place (that’s where we are staying) and my
    aunt took a snooze, Jim and Henry went to buy a fan but it was sold out everywhere
    because of the heat wave yesterday and everybody bought one I guess. I was
    on the computer working on my assignment. Phew, is this ever long!</p>


  

<p>Day Ten: Friday, August 08, 1997 </p>


  

<p>We left early in the morning at around 9:00 am to back home. Guess what?
    It was raining! So I was like, ‘Yes! We left Calgary on a day it rains
    so we’re probably heading into sunshine in Vancouver.’ So anyway,
    it seemed like a longer trip back, but it was only 11 hours including the
    washroom breaks. I was praying that we would get back on time for GQ and we
    made it at 7:15 pm! But to my dismay, my mother couldn’t drive me and
    Gladys could only drive my brother ‘cuz she was driving the pick-up.
    Oh no! So I quickly phoned Lawrence as my last resort and yees! He was able
    to drive my sister and I to church, which ended up almost givin’ me a
    headache ‘cuz I couldn’t stand that tension and ‘fighting’
    in that planning room. Anyway, I’m done my assignment now.</p>


  

<p>This is L’il Bo-Peep signing off!</p>

		<p>				In spite of the chilly afternoon, a warmth that radiated from within tempted
    me to enter the room. As I stepped beyond the doors into the room, I noticed
    it right away, sitting upon the bare dresser: dead centre. Nothing else surrounded
    this miniature picture frame of gold. One would expect to find a photograph
    of a loved one or of some sort. Yet, to my surprise, in place of the expected,
    all I saw was a black void, a darkness of . . . nothing. <br>
    My eyes diverted its attention from the frame to the marks on the wooden dresser.
    As I peered closely, I noted that the imprints, which led to the edge of the
    dresser, resembled tiny footprints in the sand. It was almost as if someone
    had once walked across the dresser and went on to glance over the edge. I
    was bewildered at the notion such a the thought. My fingers were about to
    trace over the marks when my eyes caught a glint reflecting off the golden
    frame. I looked around the room in puzzlement, wondering how it could have
    happened without a change in angle of the frame’s position. I continued to
    stare at the empty frame for my eyes were caught in a magnetic force that
    riveted them toward the darkness. With my fingers, I carefully picked it up
    and held it to eye-level. </p>


  

<p>To my utter amazement, the void of nothingness seemed to shimmer as if it
    was alive. Forcing myself to blink a few times, I cautiously examined it again.
    Indeed, something was truly happening. Almost unnoticeablely, a hazy, gray
    silhouette slowly took form. The outline of a young girl, with sparkling eyes
    of youth and a smile possessing a knowledge that I did not recognize, greeted
    me. She appeared to beckon me and I felt compelled to respond to her strong
    invitation despite my doubts. </p>


  

<p>My finger hesitantly moved toward the frame and reached out to touch the
    velvet material of the once dark picture. Suddenly, I felt this sensation
    of being yanked into the void beyond my control. This deceiving girl held
    a strength that I lacked. Despite my efforts to take my hand away, my entire
    being was soon engulfed by this darkness. I was the unsuspecting victim that
    fell prey to her bait. The magnetic force pulled me into an unfamiliar realm.
    As I passed from one world into the next, she became free. She flowed into
    my body as I penetrated the separation and released herself from within me
    at the point where my being left the accustomed world completely. I was speechless!
    Unintentionally, I had taken her place. I felt the evil in her; it was so
    strong that it was emitted through the black screen. I began to protest, with
    my lips moving in silence, for sound did not exist any longer. </p>


  

<p>To my horror, the seemingly beautiful girl picked up the picture frame, and
    hurled it at the window. Instantly, it shattered and I knew that it was over;
    there was no more hope. I was to be forever trapped in the abyss. </p>

		<p>				The saying goes, “Love is blind.” Well, I declare that beauty blinds
    common sense . . . my, what great fortune! For bestowed before me, on a midsummer’s
    day, was the loveliest creature that I ever laid my eyes upon-graceful in
    every way, sophisticatedly draped in the reddest of reds. As she inquired
    of the time, her intriguing eyes held mine captive and I could not help but
    ask whither she was destined. She was to be a-ridin’ to “da ‘hood”-the
    ghettos where her ailing grandmother resided. Most certainly a dangerous place
    for a dame like her to be travelling to alone. Being a gentleman, I kindly
    offered my company. What came next was unexpectedly pleasurable. She seductively
    gave a farewell kiss with a soft declining “thank-you” whispered
    in my ear. Would I give so much as to have her! </p>


  

<p>Oh, the maddening desire in me would not still. Mesmerized, I hastened to
    her grandmother’s; intensity came over me and I took care of the old lady.
    I slipped into her bed unaware, awaiting. Shortly after, she glided in-her
    face still as she lifted the covers to discover me in her grandmother’s place.
    “Darling, come to bed with me!” Alas, my enticing power could not
    entrance her. Instead, she looked deep into my eyes and remarked, “What
    big eyes you have indeed!” Why, certainly all the more to gaze at her
    with. I could control my urges no longer, and forced her . . . Thus, the unfortunate
    fate of Little Red. Would you not agree that all women are trouble? </p>

		<p>				Would you believe that a time ago, hot dogs were one dollar and coca-colas
    were twenty-five cents? I was once again a child, with my hair tied into pigtails
    that bounced whenever I jumped or ran. With my pink T-shirt, yellow shorts,
    and plastic sandals, I ran about in the summer heat catching the rays of the
    sun whilst sprinting through lawn sprinklers that watered the freshly cut
    grass. </p>


  

<p>One sunny day, after a tiresome afternoon of pure play, my childhood friends
    and I went to a nearby tree. We sat beneath the big branches that shaded us
    from the scorching coming from beams of sunshine. I heard the gentle breeze,
    which whispered through the leaves and through the dancing willows in the
    bubbling brook beyond the woods. As I sat in the comforting shade, I saw that
    the whole world was lazy, like us. The adults were on their porches gossiping
    away while sipping their iced lemonades. Other children held paper fans folded
    in haste by their swift fingers as they played hopscotch and sang skipping
    rope rhymes. </p>


  

<p>A ringing of bells unexpectedly cut into the summer air, which was filled
    with the warmth of joyous laughter. The faint ‘ding-a-ling, ding-ding’ drew
    distinctively nearer. To satisfy my curiosity, I squinted past the bright
    sun and saw the silhouette of a boy, not much older than us, riding a bicycle
    down our street. Behold! What was that he had trailing behind him? At that
    instant, we all knew. Every one of us dashed from under the tree to our parents,
    who were engrossed in their conversations under the porch, to plead for seventy-five
    cents. Interrupting their conversations, I tugged on my father’s shirt and
    looked at my mother, asking them if they would be willing to give me my allowance
    a week early. I knew I would have to sacrifice whatever sweets I would be
    able to buy with that money, but it would most definitely be worthwhile. </p>


  

<p>I knew what I wanted. Along with the rest of them, I ran to the bicycle with
    my sandals chanting ‘flap-flop-flap-flop’ as it hit the pavement with each
    step. I patiently waited for my turn as five children lined up in front of
    me. Finally, after standing for what seemed like eternity, I did not hesitate
    to give up every penny for what would relieve and refresh me from the heat.
    Of course I chose my favourite flavour, strawberry. I had always loved the
    heavenly taste of sweet strawberries, in a mouthful of cool ice cream, with
    a bite of the crisp waffle cone. Uh-oh, what did the boy say? There was no
    more left! I hung my head with disappointment and began to walk away. With
    much effort on his part however, presumably after feeling sorry for me, he
    was able to gather enough for one last scoop. With my priceless treasure in
    hand, I hastily licked the sides of the cone just as a hint of strawberry
    ice cream began to melt. I could not allow it to drip onto the sidewalk and
    watch it disappear; I needed to savour every taste! </p>


  

<p>As I slowly walked back into the shade, my eyes were fixed on the waffle
    cone to ensure that the ice cream would not melt in front of me. The boy,
    who sold us the ice cream, had now gone to another street with his ‘ring-a-ling’
    fading into the distance. I climbed the tree trunk and sat in the lowest branch
    with one hand holding onto the waffle cone, and the other, pulling myself
    up and keeping myself steady. I could finally begin to fully enjoy my ice
    cream cone without having to worry about the dreaded enemy, the heat of the
    sun. With my feet swinging from the branches, I carefully brought the yummy
    treat to the corner of my mouth. </p>


  

<p>To my utter disbelief, with the first lick at the centre of the strawberry
    ice cream, the scoop of ice cream fell out of the cone it rested on, and dropped
    from the tree onto the grass below. Instantly, the grass greedily gulped the
    melted puddle. With my eyes wide, I was left staring at my hand holding a
    waffle cone with a big gaping hole in the middle. Realizing what had just
    happened, I sat there weeping my eyes out at the tragic loss. My heart broke
    in two for my beloved sunshine had melted my cherished ice cream; it had become
    my childhood foe. </p>

“Man, I want to, but I can’t because of my mom,” the teenager shrugged. He went on to mimic his mother, “Jesse, don’t you dare throw that thing away; your aunt gave it to you!” Curses then flew from his mouth and hit me hard like a slap across the face.”
</p>






I realised that his mother didn’t like me either when she referred to me as a “thing”. She only made him keep me due to the fear of what the aunt’s reaction would be if she found out. So I was trapped in a hole of darkness within myself. How could I shine for the world with brightness when everything seemed so dim?





One night, when half of the world and the sun were asleep, I was staring into the darkness and pondering on why I was created. Before I had a change to really think about it, I was interrupted by a rumble and a slight tremble of the dresser. I had no idea what was happening, so I was really puzzled. It then began to wobble back and forth, which made me dizzy as I gazed around. In the dim, I squinted to watch the surrounding things begin to let gravity yank them away from where they were and they plunged to the cold, hard floor below. I teetered dangerously at the edge of the dresser and finally, had no hope of hanging on any longer. I could not suspend my weight in mid-air for that long.


<p>
“Aaagh!” The muffled groans and cries for help from the youth awoke me. I too had been trapped in this mess. Yet, unrealistically, I did not feel any pain, only detachments from different parts of me. I sensed that I could not do anything for this boy any longer for I was broken into pieces. People tried to save the boy, but how could they have in pitch-darkness? They were all lost and they didn’t know which direction to turn. Darkness had won this time; it had strangled a life.
</p>






Sitting here again, I reflect back and realise that no matter how I look, or how much people hate me, I have to do my job shining light into the world of darkness. I cannot simply give up and let the darkness smolder everybody. What I see reflecting





Sitting here again, I reflect back and realise that no matter how I look, or how much people hate me, I have to do my job–shining light into a world of darkness. I cannot simply give up and let the darkness smolder everybody. What I see reflecting back from another mirror are scars, mended cracks that remind me that I have been given another chance to shine for the whole world to see. Mistakes and bad experience have a purpose: you learn from them, growing in wisdom, and you allow them to mold you to who you really are. I am here for only one reason–to be a light, providing a path of brightness so the world can find its way out of the darkness.
