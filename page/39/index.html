		<p>				A friend from work showed me a short titled “Call Center Movie” online last night and after calling Dell today, it completely reminded me of that film:


</p><ul><li>First, the representative that answered my call sounded like someone from India (and with a name that matched the profile). He had a lot of difficulty with my first and last name (my coworkers burst out laughing because apparently they overheard me saying, “No, unfortunately, my name is [insert name here].” (he thought I said Moe)</li>




<li>I could hear myself (echo?) during parts of the conversation – was it VOIP or just poor connectivity?</li>




<li>He asked me for my phone number, put me on hold (a number of times throughout the call), and then, the first time when he came back, apologized for the wait, re-introduced himself and said,  “May I have your phone number please?” to which I responded with, “You already have it.” He denied it, and when I repeated it back to him, he then realised he already had it.</li>




<li>He mentioned that the special was going to expire on Thursday if I didn’t buy it, which I rephrased, “You mean today [which happened to be Thursday] right?” (was he in a different time zone?)</li>




<li>And, finally, it seems like Dell have arbitrary quotes. I got one quote for the <a href="http://configure.dell.com/dellstore/config.aspx?c=ca&CS=CADHS1&l=en&OC=E521A2P_F_1E" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dimension E521</a> using an EPP code (which he mixed up and thought I was calling to use an EVAL code), but when another coworker called in with the same code, he got quoted with a much higher price (a difference in 4%). I then used the online chat and asked if I removed certain components of the system, would I save anything? One rep said $15, the other said $30. The rep on the phone said the prices would not be any different if I removed any bundled components.</li>


</ul>


I am satisfied that the rep (representing well of Dell in this case) made an one-time exception (as he emphasized and stressed) and honoured their own quotes and how the rep handled what I presented; I had to be quite firm, but I was generally pretty happy at how it turned out in the end. Lesson of the day? Do your research and think of all the possible options before you purchase.




<p><b>Update:</b> The specs  – really for my own reference:</p>




<p><b>Hardware</b><br></p><ul><li>AMD Athlon 64 X2 Dual-Core 3800+</li>




<li>1GB Dual Channel DDR2 SDRAM at 533MHz- 2DIMMs</li>




<li>250GB SATA Hard Drive (7200 RPM)</li>




<li>16x DVD+/-RW Drive</li>


</ul><b>Software</b>


<ul><li>Genuine Windows Vista Home Premium</li>




<li>Microsoft Works 8.0 and Norton Internet Security – (antivirus) 15 months (both of which I really do not need or necessarily want)</li>


</ul><br><b>Other</b>


<ul><li>1 Year Next Business Day Onsite/In Home Service and Tech Support</li>




<li>No mouse or keyboard or monitor</li>


</ul><br>Bundled package for $510 CDN + tax (a savings of $60 off the sale price) and free shipping.




<p><b>Update #2:</b> <i>Ahhhh</i>, I could’ve gotten a better system for $100+ less (160G HD, no Antivirus, 4200+ processor). Alas, it’s not a similiar system, thus the price protection plan (that’s valid within 1 month of purchase) is not applicable. Shame that return costs $87 on my system. The rep says that the processing speed makes no difference with the same components. In the end, he offered a $15 one-time coupon for my next purchase. Oh yes, and he did tell me that he was in India.

		<p>				Sometimes, I get a taste of the real world outside of the time warp; I treasure these moments. Take tonight for example – a few of my friends from work (though I have not really worked on the same team with them ever) spent a good two hours at <a href="http://www.ellisonsbistro.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ellison’s</a> for the usual (jerk chicken), catching up and exchanging stories. Hanging out with those guys always makes my day – they’re pretty easy going and just fun to be with (not to mention that they’re outside of the time warp!). They basically make everyone feel like family albeit our culture, language, lifestyle and religious differences. Ah yes, they are guys (see?).</p>




<p>Snowboarding on Saturday was almost perfect! I could not ask God for a better day: the sun was shining, the sky was clear, there weren’t too many people on the mountain (hill), and it was all the runs were great to learn on (wide runs, many to choose from, all blues = greens). I don’t think I’ve ever snowboarded in such warm weather either: -5C was the high, but it felt much warmer than that. The snow was a little hard (packed), which made for falling on a little more painful (but I’ve had worse than that) – this time, I thought to wear my roller-blade knee pads under my snowpants (because of my forever busted knees) and this is the best use I’ve gotten out of them. I will have to remember to do that every time now. I find that whenever I start the season, it feels like I have to learn how to snowboard all over again. I’ve switched back from goofy to regular, and I find it’s easier to learn how to turn (though it’s odd because I can only stay straight if I look straight (with my face toward the side of the mtn) as opposed to down and can only turn right if I look up the mountain (go figure?).</p>

		<p>				<a href="http://www.burnabyalliancechurch.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BAC</a> recently had a series on friendship. The term “soul friends” reminded me of Anne of Green Gable’s definition of bosom friends, or kindred spirits – friends, regardless of age, who you have a spiritual and emotional connection with – and <i>who are of the same gender</i>.</p>




<p>I didn’t know how to respond to these talks as during the time of “open sharing”, I couldn’t even come up with even one name, of which I would call a current “soul” friend (though I do have girl friends who I would deem “close”).</p>




<p>This time (without the rush of Christmas and because I had spent time with family during Christmas), I had the chance to hang out with a few of my friends in Vancouver. I really enjoyed the fellowship I had with them. From dining out in Gastown and waking up at 6AM for breakfast in Chinatown, to playing Munchkin (and making an opponent drop 6 levels!),  hanging out with another friend for one whole day (getting his errands done), and finally ending the trip with a great lunch with 20+ people, most of whom I rarely see, or have not talked with in a long time – I think it would be a great community builder if this happened more often after church (this does here in ‘loo, but not at home and there’s nothing like food to keep spirits up and conversations going).</p>




<p>Strangely enough, the week after,  the theme of the week in my devotionals also reminded me of these friendships…and admittedly, I have very few “soul friends” who are girls (though from what the pastor said, we should be diligent in praying for them, which I am guilty of not doing or wanting to do). For me, I’m not sure why friendships with girls seem to come harder than with guys. I guess over the years at my home church, with more guys than girls in my age group, I ended up connecting with more guys than with girls. Or, perhaps it is the risk of losing another “soul” friend – at times, I feel that I still have yet to come to terms with how much two people can change so that a great friendship just becomes a mere “aquaintanceship”.</p>




<p>I think the place where I am now, increases the difficulty in me opening up for the possibility of “soul” friends; I recently termed it as “being stuck in a time warp”; it feels like I’m stuck in a place where faces keep changing, but they are all of the same age range (and profession: student) but I’m just here, getting older. There are, of course, career people in my spiritual community (few and far between), but there’s a gap from where they are, and where I am. You know, if I ever was to leave, it would be because to escape this time warp; and that rattles me, because it means that this could be the start of wanting to leave this place as reluctant as I am.</p>

		<p>				Over the past few weeks, I had a chance to eat at two different Indian restaurants for their buffet lunch with a few of my friends.</p>




<p>A brief comparison, with some comments, is below:</p>




<hr><h4>Restaurant</h4>




<p>
<b>Masala Bay</b> [MB] – a small restaurant with Indian/Southeast Asian colours and decor
<br><b>Classic Indian</b> [CI]- a small restaurant that gets full really quickly – caters to business crowd for weekday lunches; has a  “kitchen” feel
</p>




<hr><h4>Meal Choice</h4>




<p>
<b>[MB]</b> The lunch buffet seems to have raised in price; it’s a little over $12 now, but the food variety is quite plentiful (especially for lunch) and a range of vegetarian selections is offered:


</p><ul><li>Fruits and salads</li>




<li>Samosas, nan bread</li>




<li>Various meat and veggie curries including  eggplant, chick peas, goat or lamb?, beef, chicken (incl. butter and tandoori chicken)</li>




<li>Dessert</li>


</ul><p>
<b>[CI]</b> Price for the lunch buffet is $9.49, with a limited selection of food (but for lunch, you really don’t need that much) and some vegetarian options:


</p><ul><li>lentil spiced chips, deep fried potato samosas (with dipping sauces like chilli yogurt, spicy mango chutney), and crispy onions appetizers</li>




<li>Chickpea curry, eggplant curry, beef curry, and chicken curry</li>




<li>Lentil soup (made my throat itchy because of the puree and spices) – this one won a “healthy” award of some kind and they sell it by the jar</li>




<li>Chai Tea (with a lot of spices)</li>




<li>Dessert</li>


</ul><hr><h4>Food Presentation and Quality</h4>




<p><b>[MB]</b> The curries and dishes in general were quite flavourful and did not taste nor look the same (I find that to be the case sometimes). They  ranged from mildly spicy to a medium spicy (in terms of “hot/tingly”-wise). While the meat was tender and the sauces did have a good meat/veggie ratio – as opposed to mostly sauce), I did find certain pieces of the butter chicken (or was it tandoori?) a little to dry – perhaps it was because it was sitting under the heat lamps for too long (tho the curries were heated in buffet trays). As with most Indian cuisine, I tend to be very particular on which spices I like, and which I do not – so not everything appealed to my tastes.
</p>




<p>
<b>[CI]</b> The meat was not as tender as I had hoped, and the sauces were quite mild. The one thing I’ve noticed about buffets is that the sauces tend to just drip together, so after awhile, you just taste the same (though I suppose I could’ve tried a different dish each trip). The nan bread was soggy because it was put inside a pot (water condensation) and thus was chewy, but oddly enough, I liked the crispy deep fried onion appetizers (thoroughly cooked and they were in bits and pieces). For many of the sauce/curry dishes, I found that I had to dig around in the sauce, before I could scoop up some meat or vegetables. Lunch overall was flavourful (especially after, when you walk back into the office and your clothes smell like the spices)
</p>




<hr><h4>Service</h4>




<p><b>[MB]</b> I’ve noticed that buffet places tend to have minimal service, but they do dutifully come and collect your finished plates when you go up for another serving of food.  However, I did notice that the lady behind the counter was just sitting behind her laptop for the majority of the time (and it seemed, rather…rude?).
</p>

<b>[CI]</b> Dishes were taken away when you were busy getting more food, and I really liked how the curries and other available options would be refilled, even when that selection was not running low – so you could always have a supply of freshly made/ready food
</p>




<hr><h4>Conclusion</h4>




<p><b>[MB]</b> For $12 lunch, I think I would only return every so often, but of all the Indian buffets I’ve tried, I’ve enjoyed the food at this one the most.
</p>



<p>
<b>[CI]</b> I haven’t decided I would return again when I can pay $2 more for a better experience (and atmosphere).</p>

		<p>				Did you know that it is illegal in Ontario to fill an out-of-province prescription?</p>




<p>Never mind out of country, but what harm can out-of-province be? Though, I suppose
one can get marijuana in BC for medicinal purposes but may not be accepted here. However, in Alberta, you can fill out-of-province prescriptions.</p>




<p>My options?


</p><ul><li>Get it filled online and pay for shipping</li>




<li>Buy it in the States, as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naproxen">Naproxen</a> is available over the counter</li>




<li>Use an old prescription that I found as I was cleaning up my room the other day, which coincidentally had the same drug in a smaller quantity on the form*.</li>


</ul>


*The pharmacist had told me that while they refuse to fill out-of-province prescriptions, they can fill old ones at their discretion




<p>I felt like such a druggie  and wanted to cry when the pharmacist told me she couldn’t help me and I responded by asking, “so how can I get another prescription?” She told me I had to go to a walk-in clinic to which I said forget it, I can’t afford that (the 3 hours wait for a 30 second session). Rather frustrating seeing that I went to the doctor (which I prefer to avoid) for no reason (and that I could’ve filled it before I left but due to time and other constraints (like forgetting to bring it with me when I went to the mall), I didn’t).</p>

		<p>				a few nights ago, i remember finding out that b’s mom died (even though i don’t know her), and i felt really sad for him. but knowing that dre was a good friend who went through a similiar experience was there for him for support really helped.

—

i ended up in edmonton for 6 months; i remember it being edmonton because i appended “:: edmonton” to the end of my msn name. the strange thing is that when i arrived, i decided to visit the campus first (which had a gym, outdoor rink) and i somehow bumped into people i knew: tunger, my sis, chewie, boy and even renee! originally, i had arranged to have lunch w boy, but he ended up having to cancel, so i went to see what the others were up to. a girl i knew invited me to play badminton, but i realised that i had forgotten to bring shoes (minus the ones that were on my feet) or any gym/cooler clothes and i had thought that edmonton was a cold place (so i only brought warm clothes). i thought that i should’ve brought skates too as the outdoor rink that you could bus to (last service was til tues at some time), which was available for use, but rentals were $7.95 and $8.95 depending on the type of skate you wanted to rent.</p>



<p>i ended up talking to renee to see if she had a chance to buy a new place yet, because i ended up just waiting around (for what i don’t know).</p>

		<p>				Day Three, February 8, 2007


</p><h4>Opening Keynote</h4>


Kelly Goto started the morning off with her talk titled, “Designing for Lifestyle: Past, Present and Future”. Parts of her material overlapped with the workshop material, benefiting those who missed the workshop. Using various examples, she compared technology in the past, present, and briefly suggested possibilities for the future and mentioned a few design principles:


<ul><li>Lifestyle design: design integrated into daily living</li>




<li>Past: Turing Test, Eliza, subserviant chicken (which I have not seen, but many have)</li>




<li>Present: lifestyle + innovation focused companies (e.g. Google, Apple, JetBlue); “web 2.0”; merging technology (e.g. GPS + mobile phones); moving to a new start-up culture</li>




<li>Design experience: practice + emotional (can it entice users to move forward even if it is not “usable”; is it “addictive”?)</li>




<li>Content services – designing for mobile devices. Take the youth market for example, in China, a youth from 12-18 years old average $89/year vs. in US $4900/year.</li>




<li>Design Ethnography (ethnography being the study of how people live in their environments)</li>




<li>Use usability groups. “How many people wash their hands after going to the washroom?” is a question that fits under a focus study (group) because that’s what people <i>think</i> they would do, but put a camera in the washroom to record the actual number, and that becomes a usability test (group).</li>




<li>Future: Web 3.0?</li>


</ul><h4>Morning Session</h4>


<
p>After morning tea, I opted for <a href="http://abitofgeorge.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">George Oates</a> (flickr) and <a href="http://www.paulhammond.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Paul Hammond’s</a> “Web App2: Developer to Designer”. Much of it sounded like a promo for Flickr but they did a good job tying in the two groups of developers/designers:


<ol><li>Front-end developer (I realise that’s what I am): focuses on interaction experience, design experince, user experience using markup (e.g. CSS, HTML)</li>




<li>Back-end developer: focuses on MySQL, PHP, etc.  (programming, database)</li>


</ol>


I was reminded of layers, the separation between content and presentation using a great analogy of a trifle (a layered dessert):


<ol><li>fruit topping: presentation (e.g. CSS)</li>




<li>cream: markup (e.g. HTML)</li>




<li>custard: page logic (e.g. template (languages))</li>




<li>jelly: business logic (e.g. PHP)</li>




<li>sponge: database (e.g. mySQL)</li>


</ol>


Because Flickr was used as examples, this also made me think of an idea to use GPS-enabled mobile devices with built-in cameras to capture coordinates on each picture taken, so to easily upload it to Flickr instead of using the Organizr to drag and drop it. (Went home, did some research and found that <a href="http://www.flickr.com/account/geo/exif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">someone already thought of it</a>).


<h4>Lunch</h4>


A catered buffet lunch at the rotating Vistas with a Mexican theme. I think we enjoyed the food, especially the dessert selection (it was tiramisu on the first day, mango cheesecake and “Chinese” desserts like fortune cookies on the second, and vanilla lime flan and chocolate cake (that tasted like brownie) during this lunch).


<h4>Afternoon Session</h4>


<a href="http://www.mezzoblue.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dave Shea</a> and <a href="http://veerle.duoh.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Veerle Pieters</a> (I now realize that I’ve been pronouncing her first name incorrectly all this time) engaged us in another cozy chat from the couch about the design process and influences, which somewhat reminded me of classroom material but interesting nevertheless as they shared anecdotal experiences with us (and so many questions from the audience) that they ended up running out of time; indeed, this session did feel like it passed by very quickly.
Ideas:


<ul><li>Creative organization: work environments (colors, location, space, light – apparently one can rent a desk and share an office with other organizations)</li>




<li>Organization tools: time tracking (iBiz), invoicing (FileMaker), planning/calendar/contacts (iCal/Daylite), sketchbook for creativity</li>




<li>Handling requests: definition of project scope, site navigation/browser support, number of templates, proposal, payment, “what’s your desired budget range?”,  </li>




<li>Inspiration: online – CSS galleries, design books (non-web/subj related: interior design, graphic, flickr)</li>




<li>experimental and self-imposed constraints (recommendation: only show 1 mockup to client so can put forth best work and thus will limit options; can improve on mockup)</li>




<li>involve client early on; level of detail will affect feedback level</li>




<li>Credibility and trust: rapid communication, email communication (easy archiving)</li>




<li>list in proposal: problem, solution, methodology (e.g. max # of rounds/mocks), contingency (if either party not satisfied, then what?)</li>


</ul><h4>Closing Keynote</h4>


Jared Spool closed the afternoon, and the conference with a fantastic talk about User Experience. I had never heard of him before then, but I would be glad to hear him speak again (he integrates humor in effortlessly, as well as some magic). When I first sat down, his slides reminded me of academic lectures (his slides felt more … mechanical? … structured? – hard to describe … not artsy.); it later made sense when he told us that he was probably one of the only few there that had not designed a website before.
Even though he hadn’t he sure had experience in the area user interface engineering (how people interact with technology) – HCI (human computer interaction) would fit right in. He used case studies to demonstrate that an effective experience design does not have to rely on the latest technology to be a success (e.g. ipods vs. sensa (latter has better technology but less popular); that, if you integrate the user and the business, you are on your way to sucessful experience design, which is:


<ul><li>invisible</li>




<li>multidisciplinary</li>




<li>cultural</li>




<li>and could be learned, but not open to introspection</li>


</ul>


“When it works well, we don’t think about it.”
The essential experience design components include vision: understanding where you are going with it (in 5, 10, 15, etc. years from now), the right people, and a fast feedback loop (get riding of notion of complete redesign; design in small chunks).


<h4>Evening</h4>


MediaTemple hosted a “legendary” closing party, with open bar and invitation to bring a friend along. I chose not to attend, partially because I’m not much of a partier and I had to finish up working on the publication at the printers (which I can now say it’s finally done). Ended up at Shiro (Cambie and 15th), a good Japanese sushi bar that some Waterloo folks went to last time I was here.]]>

		<p>				Day Two, February 7, 2007


</p><h4>Opening Keynote</h4>




<p><a href="http://molly.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Molly E. Holzchlag</a>, whose last name I cannot pronounce (even after hearing it), started the Web Directions North conference off by reminding us of the error of our ways (back then, and even now – yes, even now I am guilty of doing some of these at my workplace), some of which include:


</p><ul><li>scrolling  marquees</li>




<li>frames (do iframes count too?)</li>




<li>scrollbar tweaks</li>




<li>open tags</li>




<li>empty paragraph tags/elements and tables for presentational formatting</li>




<li>garbage code generated by software like FrontPage, MS Word, Dreamweaver</li>




<li>“best viewed in” resolution and browser recommendations on the site</li>




<li>*html hacks in CSS</li>




<li>content/text using images and spacer gifs</li>


</ul>


Although I haven’t heard of Molly prior to this conference, and I wasn’t too sure what to expect with a talk titled “Crime Against Web Standards”, I felt it was a good way lead into the conference – not too heavy, and somewhat fun (if not funny) as there were “forgiveness” gifts for the worst crimes. She even showed us some clips from Erik A. Meyer and Neil C. Ford.





<h4>Morning Session</h4>




<p>I’m not much of a backend developer, so I decided to attend <a href="http://www.cameronmoll.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cameron Moll</a> and <strike>Doug Bowman</strike> <a href="http://tantek.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tantek Celik’s</a> session titled, “Design and Coding at the cutting edge”.  Cameron used his own website as an example in the session and spoke of designing for mobile devices (which I, considering the company I work for, really should start doing) and Tantek spoke about microformats, which I’m neither too familiar with nor really interested in, but at least I came out more knowledgeable about it than going in. </p>




<p>One idea that Cameron mentioned was <i>chiasms</i> (where abc parallels with c’b’a’) in design such as print. I learned about chiasms in the context of parallelism in poetry and narrative, specifically in the Hebrew Bible (Old Testament). To see it apply elsewhere is quite interesting. The rest of the session reminded me of classroom material such as  using typography as a part of design.</p>




<p>By the end of the morning, I decided to cave in and buy me a textbook. I chose <a href="http://www.transcendingcss.com/" target>Transcending CSS: The Fine Art of Design</a>, partially because the retail price was so high (and was then selling for $40) and admittedly, because the book was so <i>pretty</i>. Yes, I was captured by the colours, gloss, and the pictures (and of course, the content is relevant to my interests).</p>




<h4>Lunch</h4>




<p>A catered buffet lunch was served at Vistas with a Chinese fusion theme, with the restaurant actually revolving this time.  This meal is where I again chat with Dennis (from Sydney, AU) and Rachel (a local Vancouverite), and Jason (from Ottawa) and <a href="http://endesign.ca">Eric</a> (Toronto) for the first time. </p>




<h4>Afternoon Session</h4>




<p>I have minimal  interest in microformats as you now know, so there was not conflict in choosing to attend <a href="http://www.stuffandnonsense.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Andy Clarke</a> and Aaron Gustafson’s “Transcendent design with Javascript and CSS”.  Looking back and hearing what other’s said, this was a brief summary of the workshop and parts of it sounds like what is in the book I bought. I was excited to hear about <b>CSS3</b> and the possibilities of what it can do, such as:


</p><ul><li>text across multi-columns (like newspapers)</li>




<li>zebra striping (odd & even highlighting)</li>


</ul><p>This is where I realised the reasoning for using -900px (or some ambigious number) to carry text off the screen, which although hidden to desktop users, remains readable for screenreaders and such (accessibility), which helped me partially understand parts of a web site I’ve been wrestling with at work and why text disappears after it loads (not because it’s at -900, but maybe because of the way the style sheets loads/is called).
</p>




<h4>Closing Keynote</h4>




<p><a href="http://joeclark.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Joe Clark</a>, from Toronto, used the <a href="http://www.ttc.ca" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TTC website</a> as an example for his “fireside chat” on accessibility and usability. While the modernist couch, fake green plant, lamp and bookshelf really added a nice, cozy touch to the stage area, short people like me couldn’t really see the speaker, unless they were sitting on the side.</p>




<p>A couple of key points:


</p><ul><li>the TTC website was done in 1998 by an animation student and hasn’t been redone since. There is actually a “fan club” of the TTC that meets.</li>




<li>Try to avoid using PDF, PowerPoint and/or Word files. Use XML or plain text instead.</li>




<li>Parts of the process: observation, ideation, evaluation, definition, testing, refinement(?)</li>


</ul><h4>Evening</h4>




<p>Adobe finished the night by welcoming us with a reception. Unfortunately, I missed out on the drinks (though I did grab some hors d’oeuvres on the way out) as I had to run to the printers to finish up a publication that Alex and I have been working on. Finished off the night at <a href="http://www.steamworks.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steamworks</a> with its reputable fish and chips and their home brew root beer (which isn’t too sweet so it suits my tastes).</p>

		<p>				Day One, February 7, 2007


</p><p>
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aimeili/389907895/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/128/389907895_263d36ef8d_m.jpg" width="180" height="240" alt="The Iterative Process: Workshop" align="left"></a>
Registration (sign-in) began at 8:30 AM, so I got up a little earlier and started the day with a tall cafe mocha at Starbucks along with a raspberry apricot thumbprint scone (which is pretty good) for my breakfast, as I knew I could not last until tea time (apparently, the Aussie equivalent of “coffee break”). The weather was quite nice – mild and dry!</p>




<p>I attended Kelly Goto’s, the Iterative App. I did not initially sign up for it, as it was not yet available when I registered for the conference, but when it was offered, I decided to switch from CSS + Javascript = Magic to hers because I felt that I could learn technology on my own, whereas processes are better learned in person.</p>




<p>Even though I was not familiar with her work prior to the conference, her 28+ years of business and design experience seem to have showed in helping define what works and what doesn’t. I appreciated that workshop had some lecture but also provided room for group collaboration and interaction, using hands-on experience to role play and mock up what real life processes could be like – which also helped us get to know other people at the conference.</p>


<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aimeili/389907813/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/137/389907813_7b93823ad1_m.jpg" width="180" height="240" alt="The Iterative Process: Workshop" align="right"></a>


<p>Take aways:


</p><ul><li>My workplace actually use processes similar to existing models that have names!</li>




<li>Prototyping is useful. Although the handouts may have said that “paper prototyping is passe”, we found that paper prototyping has its advantages and can be quite valuable: low fidelity, ease of reorganization and change.</li>


</ul><p>I think I would’ve liked to see more about the iterative process (or gone through a mock process), as I found the latter session in the afternoon focused heavily on user testing (which too is important).</p>




<p>Today was the day that I found out just how poor the promised wireless access was at the conference. I tried connecting to the workshop staging area to download the resources, but trying to download a document that is 54 MB in size and getting 14.4 KB download speeds at best (when you could get on) was very frustrating. That was when I decided that I was going to throw my “live-blogging” plans out the window.</p>




<p>A catered buffet lunch was served at Vistas Revolving Restaurant & Bar on level 19. I was slightly disappointed that the restaurant wasn’t revolving. This was also around the time that I discovered that the lifts (elevators) did not provide a good user experience either (oh the irony, seeing that we were at a conference that focused a lot about usability): the doors would open and close at random (or would not close), would arrive at the floor and not open (forcing the passenger to call it again), or would skip floors for no reason, even though the light was lit, or the floor would not light up at all because the light was broken.</p>

		<p>				Day Zero, February 6, 2007
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aimeili/389907777/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/183/389907777_a0e854c1cc_m.jpg" width="240" height="180" alt="Renaissance Harbourside Hotel" align="right"></a>


</p><p>
On Monday night, I checked into the <a href="http://marriott.com/property/propertypage/YVRRD" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Renaissance Vancouver Hotel Harbourside</a>; they gave me a room on the 15th floor, one of the higher ones, but I was facing W. Hastings as opposed to the water (post-thought: from talking to a few others throughout the conference, I’m thinking that because we were paying the conference rate, none of us (if any) had the better view).
</p>




<p>Retired to bed pretty early that night, partially because I didn’t want to finish up on work work, and because I had no access to the Internet – even the open ones had weak or no connection from the 15th floor. The beds were soft, but I was able to fall asleep without any problems.</p>


<b>Pre-Conference</b>


<p>The flight  to Vancouver on <a href="http://www.westjet.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WestJet</a> (first time with them as it was an option) was an “okay” experience – leather seats feel more comfortable, but the width of them seem narrower. Thankfully, we had no one in the middle seat so I had more room to stretch out. I also had a chance to “practice” my lip-reading, as I was too cheap to pay $3 to buy a pair of airline quality headsets to watch satellite (expressVu) TV on a plane! The former-retired head of the crew had quite an interesting sense of humor: he first started off with congratulating one of the crew for passing the anger management course, and I am almost positive that he said they were serving, beer, spirits, wine, and eyeballs.  Furthermore, he ended off the trip with a joke (which of course sounds better said by him than I) that went something along the lines of:


</p><blockquote>


<div>
A hungry duck waddles into a bar and asks the bartender for some duck food.<br>
The bartender looks at him in bewilderment and says no, we do not sell duck food; we are a bar.<br>
So, the duck leaves.<br>
The next day…(*Repeat the previous three sentences two times*)<br>
The next day, the duck waddles into the same bar again and asks for some duck food.<br>
The bartender starts to become very annoyed and says, no! we do not sell duck food; we are a bar! If you come back again asking for duck food, I will nail your webbed feet onto the ground and make duck soup out of you.<br>
So, the duck leaves.<br>
The next day, the duck returns to the bar and asks the bartender for some nails.<br>
The bartender looks at him in bewilderment and says that no, he doesn’t have any nails.<br>
The duck says, “Good, now do you have any duck food?”<br></div>
