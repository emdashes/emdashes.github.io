—
<br>
The weekend has certainly been a very interesting (and enjoyable) one for me — and productive too considering I have so much to do on my plate at the moment (or lack of sleep). In the past week, I’ve discovered a few things including:


</p><ul><li>I got in contact with an elementary school friend on MSN/ICQ via my high school friend’s housemate and found out that she just got married!!! Hrm. She’s only 21 years old….
</li>




<li>On Friday evening, instead of attending CCF, I opted to join KWCAC’s Cantonese Youth Fellowship’s Praise and Worship night.
<br>
Tho’ I only knew 4 English songs, and 1 Mandarin one, the rest of them were quite easy to learn (cept for the last, which was way too fast for me to read). I find that by singing songs, my Chinese-character recognition slowly improves 🙂
Not to mention that because the language is in Chinese, I really can reflect on the meaning of words, instead of just singing for the sake of singing English Praise songs, which sometimes happens b.c sometimes I don’t even know what the English means if I pause to reflect.
</li>




<li>
First relaxing night spent after fellowship (aside from the time that I had bbletea w Jackson, Henry, Freddie, and Vernstar) to watch Chow Yun Fat’s “Doh Sun” (the god of Gambling I) @ Jesse’s, w Jeff/Jesse/Jason, and a bunch of others. Thx Jes(se)/Jeff!</li>


<br>
I have never seen it in its entirely before, but most people *namely the girls-i was the only one remaining..hrm. i should be useta this by now :P…* all left when they found out that it wasn’t a Steven Chow movie. I think they all (including moi) thought that it was gonna be a non-comedy movie full of violence. Actually, it’s quite an entertaining movie.
</ul>


I have nothing interesting to say today. My head is in a haze… :}


<p>
…OH YEAH! tha’s it. I am forever and utterly grateful to jnwong for helping me through my programming assignments. i
think he’s more motivated than i am towards my own assignments. there were certain points throughout the nights that i
had wanted to quit so badly and just hand in whatever i had (btw, the assignment is still incomplete but at least it’s
more functional than what i had to begin with), but for some reason, it just seemed like he wanted to solve watever bug
was in the pgrm. at least i have someone to keep me from giving up so easily.
</p>



<p>im soo hungry. i have no money whatsoever right now (61 cents i think is in my wallet currently. tho the bank is just
an afternoon’s away). oh well, another skipped meal. i’m starting to sound like Josh. =(. i’m just rambling because im
at work and we finally have access to the internet –temporarily :).
</p>



<p>
Update: I called the 1-800 number and talked with my supervisor from the summer and they explained to me that ALL part-time staff get a substitute day off if they didn’t work on the Monday with pay. So, I informed my current employer this, and now he somewhat understands. I think I’m relatively content that he at least understands the legislation now. There’s a mutual unsaid (well said to me) agreement between the employer and employees that if we don’t be all legalistic about pay, he won’t be in terms of our work ethics (right now we can do our homework and other extra stuff during our working hours). I think that’s pretty fair, though I also think that he should’ve explained it prior to hiring of the staff so that both parties will not have any misunderstandings.
</p>



<p>
PRAISE THE LORD! Two things on the CS midterm that I thought I failed:


</p><ol><li>I didn’t fail, even though I completely missed a sub-question (I don’t know why I didn’t see it) and didn’t have time to finish the exam. Although the class average for the raw scores were 65% and 70% (median), I got 50.5%. :{ But, I’m still really relieved b/c God answered my prayers–practically on the dot. I was sooo scared of failing…
</li>



<li>Because the lecturer felt that the exam was a lil too challenging, he up-ed our scores 4%. So, now I have 54.5%.
</li>

</ol>

Midterms season is upon the student body at large. I am yet another victim. In all my 5 years here at UW, except for my first year, I always have been able to finish writing my exams within the given period of time. However, this time, my CS algo/data structures course really disappointed me. I ran out of time! In my panic, I didn’t finish many questions, and also, messed up some questions. Other classmates noted that it was a long test as well, but I think I either failed or barely passed. Hence, I was toast and burned in the process. On the “brighter” side of things, if I don’t pass this required course, then I can’t minor in CS, which means that I only need 1 course next term to finish off my English degree. Yay.
        </p>



<p> Ironically enough, I noted to my housemate that my MIS course produced a midterm
          that was similar (not identical but key ideas same) to hers (which was
          2 years ago), to which she said, “Of course, the lecturers are consultants,
          not profesors!” Hrm, i wish I had more consultants instead of professors/master’s
          students as lecturers.
        </p>



<p>That’s not why I wanted to blog tho’. I just remembered that I wanted
          to complain YET AGAIN. haha. You see, as I was on the computer yesterday,
          a weird <a href="javascript:%20OpenWindow('screenshot.jpg')">alert</a> popped up and it was an AD! so i was like, what the..?
          And it obviously wasn’t a browser pop up, so I proceeded to do a search on <a href="http://www.google.ca" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google</a> to see what ppl said. There was only ONE article (posted quite recently) that had anything and I soon found out what happened. I still don’t know which ports to block because I got the SAME one today even though I’ve blocked Ports 135-139 BOTH UCP and TCP. I guess I’ll haveta disable messenger (not to be confused with MSN Messenger) by using the command Net Stop messenger in the command prompt — and I was having so much fun sending LAN pop-up msgs too to GKY yesterday :).
</p>



<p>
        </p>



<p>Note: Net is up and running again! 🙂 also, finally finished posting my thanksgiving weekend entry :þ Oh. UW <a href="http://www.quest.uwaterloo.ca/undergraduate/finalexams/schedule.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">final exam schedules</a> are posted: mine start on the 12th and end on the 18th.

Grr, I can’t believe that I’m using dial-up to access the Internet at home these days. Sympatico got cut during the weekend and we’re trying to reconnect with a new account (which hasn’t arrived in the mail yet)–sigh. The worst part is that my dial-up is limited to only 10 hrs/month right now (and i’ve used 3 in the last night), unless I can find other Sympatico users who will willingly let me use their username and password, or pay UW $0.40/hr for dial-up access.</p>

The weekend was awesome! Melody and I got a ride from my supervisor from work to Ottawa in a  Hyundai Accent. Ironic that the driver rarely signals, even though he was once a driving instructor. But, he was kind enough to only charge us for gas (total $20) and drove Mel to and from ‘Sauga :)! The ride there took about 6 hours (excluding 1 hr for lunch (Swiss Chalet) in Belleville), but because there was traffic from Kingston to Toronto, the ride back was an exceedingly long 8 hours w/o a long stop.
</p>



<p>
When we finally arrived, we headed out to Chinatown to eat dinner at…Man’s Kitchen. heh. Marc had to do prestudy, so J, Mel, and I had the usual stuff there. ‘cept Mel and I weren’t too hungry b/c we had lunch late (14h30). After loitering at the church, waiting for Marcy, we dropped Derrick’s cell off in Centrepointe, and the went to Poon’s to play some “board games” (which ended up to be video console games for some after awhile)–BoGGLE and Dutch Blitz. I haven’t played Blitz in sooo long :). Tho’ Mel and I weren’t “hungry”, Dom, J, Mel, and I went to Elgin Street Diner to have some food/dessert. I had a yummy piece of Triple Chocolate Cheesecake. I love cheesecake (yes, even tho i am lactose intolerant). Dom treated us all! Thanks Dom :).
</p>



<p>
By then, I was about to collapse b/c I was so tired (only mustered 3 hrs of sleep the night before because of an assignment that I wanted to finish before going away for the weekend). However, Mel and I stayed up talking til about 5:00 am, and although I had 3 hours of sleep again, she didn’t get a wink at all (new environment, etc.)! She said that it was one of the longest 3 hrs of her life :(.
</p>



<p>
Gettin up early to take a shower in a very ghetto bathroom was a very hard thing to do, especially when the toilet doesn’t flush properly. But, we got outta the house by 9 AM (in which I woke up J, but I left him be after the agonizing pain of tiredness he seemed to be in), and headed toward Parliament Hill. Interestingly enough, the place wasn’t packed and we didn’t haveta wait for the next tour. Additionally, this time, they didn’t find my swiss army knife in my bag, which is very odd. For my 2nd English tour, and my 3rd tour overall, I still learned something new: the stones on the walls are fossilized and are from Manitoba! if one looks carefully, one can see some fossil imprints remaining in the outer surfaces of the walls. And, you know how I thought that one of the portraits was stolen in a fire or something? Well, in reality, one of the paintings were cut out and saved when the Parliament burnt down–must be my poor understanding of French.. 🙂
</p>



<p>
After the tour, we headed over to the Canadian Mint to book a reservation for 3:30 PM (b/c it was then quite full). As Mel and I were quite hungry, after showing her some of the neat stores that were along Sussex, we had lunch at my fav restaurant in the Market area, The Blue Cactus–yes, I like their food (quantity and quality) for their price and the atmosphere. Soon before we finished, Dom dropped by and waited for us to clear out before taking us to the Fall Rhapsody in Gatineau Park. The trees were really nice (tho’ I don’t get why it’s such an “in” thing here as it’s almost like Spring or Fall at Burnaby Mountain).
</p>

<p>
I finally get to finish my update! We bumped into Ma-chew and S’ree as they headed to seek out Nate and Viv. Apparently, they bumped into them 1/4 into the trails since they went counter-direction-wise to them. But, we couldn’t stay b/c of the Cdn Mint tour. They apparently spelled Singapore wrong in one of their displays, and since it’s really getting to me that they’d have such a blatant spelling mistake, I e-mailed them just now. HA :).  Apparently, I hum a lot. I notice that too now that Mel has pted it out over the weekend :). Ah wells. Music is everything, as DD once pted out: w/o music, one would not be as easily moved to do anything. Shortly after the tour (in which a 50-cent coin wasn’t actually face value, but twice of what it is), Dom suggested that we go to Piccolo Grande! Yum!, I totally forgot about gelato in Ottawa :). As we waited for Josh to show, we eached enjoyed a cup full (Papaya and Mango for me! :þ). As appetites go, dessert came before dinner. We ended up at  Canal Ritz, which is this lil restaurant on Rideau Canal. The portions are not too bad. For a small size (they have large too), the food is sure filling! Thankfully, we made it on time for Elijah (even though they started characteristically late). There was some lack of organisation, but when things finally started going, they progressed into a Bible Study on “Knowing God”. Quite interesting. Unfortunately, we had “dessert” at Chu-Shing b/c apparently MK was really humid. I say unfortunately b/c there’s never anything good to eat there. Mel and I had a really hard time getting up the next morning for church. Thankfully, Mel had some sleep that night (as opposed to the first), but I think both of us had a hard time being attentive to PDjr. I do remember that the sermon had to do with Thanksgiving tho :P.
</p>



<p>
Shao (i have never met him before), Matt’s friend from UW, treated Mel and I for lunch as the 4 of us ate pho at Tu Du (or something like that). Unfortunately, it was raining that day, so we kinda got wet. Fortunately for us, Marc’s dad drove us to South Keys so that we didn’t have to take the bus and get wet. Ma-Chew and S’ree (hmm, I make it sound like they’re a couple in this entry) joined us at Cineplex before Jonah:A Veggie Tales Movie began. For those that have yet to see it, STAY for the credits and pay attention :). I think that was the second movie that I actually closed my eyes in–Marc and Mel too I think. We were all so tired. However, my ears were still wide open so I didn’t miss anything :). The whole theatre comprised of kids and their parents. We were the only ones that didn’t have kids or our parents there :P. Thx to Marc for the movie :).
</p>

Took Mel on the OCTranspo because we had to bus to Orlèans as we had an invitation to the Thanksgiving dinner that Marc’s family provided. Yum. I was really full afterwards and the three of us were falling asleep. By the time we got home, that’s what we did :). Woke up early, went to the Market for postcards and a <a href="http://www.beavertailsinc.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BeaverTail</a> 🙂 Had a REALLY quick lunch at Medieo Bistro (i thk that’s what its called). They serve Greek-ish food at somewhat of a high price but the food is really good. I ordered a 1/2 rack of lamb on greens and I rushed the order. Well, it came out in 10 mins! A lil on the rare side for me, but still edible :). I think if we weren’t pressed for time, we would’ve thoroughly enjoyed the atmosphere, food, service :).

And here, is where I begun my entry. :).

I forgot to mention that on the drive back, Todd took us down Sussex Drive, to places where ambassadors and embassys were, and also to the home of the ex-president of Corel. His house is soooo cold. It’s all gold/copper, very “square-ish”, and has a feel of an institution. Too bad that it didn’t occur to me to take a picture. I guess it’s very modern and contemporary, if you can call it that–reflective of some of the company’s products/logos (as in graphix not logic), or even ethos perhaps?</p>

During a dinner that a seeking friend (same one as mentioned elsewhere in cyberspace) and I had this week (“out” as I didn’t feel like cooking for the both of us after a long tiring day), we were discussing religion and I asked him what he thought Christianity was all about. To my “unsurprise”, the first thing that popped into his mind were “the 10 commandments”. He saw a new spin to Christianity as I tried to relate last week’s CCF Bible Study to this conversation. Jesus said, “if you love me, you’ll obey my commands” (paraphrased –see the book of John). The whole point of Christianity, which differs from many other religions is that we aren’t saved through deeds (1 bad action + 2 good actions=0), but rather, through grace. An emphasis that Catholic churches sometimes miss out (hence, purguratory or penance — to “purge” one of Wrongdoings prior to approaching the God). I learned a lot about other religions that night through my friend, and i thoroughly enjoyed our conversation.
</p>



<p>I leave you with Paul’s words (Romans 3:20):<br><i>“For no one can ever be made right in God’s sight by doing what his law commands. For the more we know God’s law, the clearer it becomes that we aren’t obeying it.”</i></p>

Remember thehomelessguy’s blog (I’m not going to directly link it here because last time I did, someone went to it and he tracked me down w a site meter that James currently uses–I’ll just let him find it on google if he hasta) that I told you about last month (before I wiped my entire file out and had to reconstruct it from a cached copy)? Well, the strangest thing is that not too long after, he was featured in USA Today. I guess the “alledged” homeless man proved himself true :). And, in case some of you missed the story, as I clicked Marcy’s blog (saved in my bookmarks), blogger decided to mess w my mind and gave me that blog instead (and w jamesie’s, garbage code). However, when I took a screenshot, I forgot to save the image, so I lost the proof… Strange.</p>

The New International Version says this about love beginning in verse 8 (to verse 13):
“Love never fails. But where there are prophecies, they will cease; where there are tongues, they will be stilled; where there is knowledge, it will pass away. For we know in part and we prophesy in part, but when perfection comes, the imperfect disappears. When I was a child, I talked like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child. When I became a man, I put childish ways behind me. Now we see but a poor reflection as in a mirror; then we shall see face to face. Now I know in part; then I shall know fully, even as I am fully known.
And now these three remain: faith, hope and love. But the greatest of these is love.”
</p>



<p>
A riddle? Not really. One interpretation applies the techniques of <i>logos</i> (appeal of reasoning) to Paul’s (author) words. Paul suggests 4 things that may have been seen as important to the church of Corinth. Through the process of elimination, the conclusion is that love is the only thing that remains. Paul implies that prophecies and tongues (languages) are only temporal; thus, only faith, hope, and love remain. Hebrews 11:1  defines faith as “being sure of what we hope for and certain of what we do not see.” Hope, is then a desire of something that’s to come. Now because a Christian will not need to have faith in God once s/he sees Him b/c then He will be seen face to face and all will know that He is real. Secondly, believers, both in Paul’s and present day, hope for Christ’s return; therefore, hope will be fulfilled in His Second Coming. Thus, only love remains, which is then why Paul labels love as being the greatest.
</p>



<p>
I’m not sure if I’ve eloquently put what I realised into understandable words, but if that made sense to you at all, read 1 Corinthians 13:4-13 again, but this time in the <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/cgi-bin/bible?passage=1COR+13&language=english&version=NLT&showfn=on&showxref=on" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">New Living Translation</a>. This version just throws the whole interpretation out the window as verse thirteen says, “There are three things that will endure–faith, hope, and love–and the greatest of these is love.” Mind you though, NLT is a more paraphrased (translated) version than NIV (which is an “in-btwn” of literal meaning (KJV) and paraphrase (NLT, CEV, TLB)). So, now, I don’t know what to think….</p>

		<p>				did end up in Mississauga and Toronto (to <i>actually</i> GO sightseeing! woo! :} )! On Friday afternoon, DD kindly drove me out to ‘Sauga so I could meet up w Mel, my hs friend, who’s on a co-op double term there. I feel so sorry for her; ‘Sauga is so uneventful–no wonder the three weekends that she’s been there, she’s been going out to TO…I think nobody can really live in ‘sauga w/o access to a car for the bus/transit system is sooo ineffecient! Can you believe that the last bus on a evening during the weekend is 20h30?! I know for a fact that in Ottawa and Vancouver, transit systems are generally running until at least midnight, if not later!


</p><p>
On Friday and Sunday, we just sat around a chilled: Vegged on the couch w Fear Factor, caught up on each other’s lives and planned for Saturday. Ah yehs, I forgot one crucial afterthought: I ended up finished half (yes, you read me correctly, that’s 1/2 of a whole) a Dominion’s chicken, some potato salad, rice, and a bowl of Cream of Mushroom soup that night; boy, was I stuffed! We left the house by 9h00 on Saturday morning to catch the GO train to Union Station ($8.60 round trip). That was my first time on the GO train; apparently, it’s almost <i>exactly</i> like the <a href="http://www.translink.bc.ca/Service_Info_and_Fares/West_Coast_Express.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">West Coast Express</a> in ‘couver b/c on the way there, we actually passed a GO train that had old(?) WCexpress cars attached to them. The thing I didn’t notice on the GO train was the workstations, and plugs for computers, but I guess it’s also that the fare is slighty cheaper for the distance travelled.
</p>



<p>
Thankfully, I wore really comfie shoes to Mel’s this weekend, else my foot would’ve been quite sore. We first tried to find our way to the ROM from Union w this really un-detailed map, but heheh, she ended up looking at the Art Museum of Ontario instead, so we arrived there. Funny though, because we ended up walking in a circle. Ah wellz :). At least we “found” the MuchMusic building that we couldn’t locate on the Net (it’s on John and near McCaul). Thus, we ended up walking up Queen’s Park, past the UT St. George Campus (woohoo, now I know where that is too!), to um…I can’t remember the name! Dundas? and Bloor St. W to the ROM. Boo, I just missed the <i>Images of Salvation</i> display at the ROM. The ROM is semi-interesting; not interesting enough for me to pay them $18. Did you know that it’s a pay-as-you-can sorta thing? Apparently, on Saturday, it was free! :). ‘cept there really was no signs or anything advertising it, but Melody found it online so YAAY! for her (I can’t seem to find that anywhere) :P. In actuality, I enjoyed the <a href="http://www.ontariosciencecentre.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ontario Science Centre</a> a lot more as it was more interactive and more appliable “oh-i-c” exhibits w less “artifacts” (which I went in 1999 for free due to my membership to all science centres in the world at that time).
</p>



<p>
So, after a big lunch at McD’s, we walked onto Bloor and headed towards Spadina and Dupont…to Casa Loma. ‘Twas a nice walk (tho long!) — Mel complained that I walk too fast hahah, well, all I wanted to do was get there….we didn’t imagine that we had to climb up a hill and some odd steps before reaching this “castle”. Thankfully, we had 2 dollars off, so the admission came to $8. However, the self-audio guide included w the admission is very lengthy and the quality unsurpasses the one at Alcatraz island. No wonder “the Rock”‘s is an award-winning one!
</p>



<p>
We took many pix, but until I get permission to post them publicly, if you wish to see them, contact me. My mom commented that if I told her that we were in Europe, she’d believe me :). The castle is nice, I admit it has the typical associations with a “castle”: secret tunnels and passages, turrets, nice gardens, etc. etc. However, I find that the <a href="http://www.boldtcastle.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Boldt’s Castle</a> is prettier (more romantic?:P) :). By the time we finished our pictures and tour, the castle was closing, so we walked back to Union and took the GO train home. During the bus ride back, we last-minutedly decided to risk the bus schedule and eat at the AMC plaza in Oakville. BUT East Side Mario’s (which M has never been to) had a 1/2 hr line up and w the wait, we’d never make the last bus home. Thus, we settled for BP (boston-pizza, not me!), which turned out well b/c Mel never been there before, even tho it’s across the street from her at home! :).
</p>



<p>
Stayed up talking and did the same the next morning/afternoon til DD came to “retrieve” me :P. Hopefully, M and S will visit ME next :). That night, I had an interesting dream, in which someone revealed to me what I already “knew” in my mind. In reality, as i was revealing my dream the following day to another source, I found out that it was true! Scary…
</p>



<p>
PS. Praise God! He answered my prayers 🙂 The professor extended my deadline for my assignments due to textbook problems til next week!</p>

ii) Vanilla Coke tastes like ice-cream float…I prefer Pepsi Twist still. And talk about inflation! The school’s pop-machines charge $1.25 now for a mere 355 ml can of pop. That’s okay, the see-lai has managed to find out that if one uses his/her student card to pay at any campus caf, the total comes to “only” $1.14.
</p>

iii) There’s a change machine in Sobey’s here which takes your change and exchanges it for a voucher to be redeemed for cash or for purchases (valid for one day), but takes away $0.09 for every dollar given. In my curiousity, I found some foreign coins on top of the machine, so I kept the foreign ones for myself (Netherlands, Britain, and another). For the pure fun of it, I decided to stick in a Galaxy (arcade at Galaxy cinemas I assume) token, which was also on top of the machine, to see what would happen. Strangely enough, a 25 cent gaming token gave me $2.00 (minus the 18 cents)! Mental note: what a good deal!</p>
