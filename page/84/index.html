<font color="maroon">Earlier on in the night, Dave Tse said that he wanted to make sure to honour his fellow brother in Christ in taking care of a Christian sister. Somehow, that led me to a dark, empty, and dusty home, where there was no apparent exit…until one last door we tried and indeed, that was the exit. </font>
<font color="#800000">In another scene, many of us were sitting in an auditorium-like place. Some large male decided to pick on certain individuals (scam or was of some threat)–my sister being one of them. My sister decided to slip quietly out of the room (from the rear exit since she was sitting a row behind me near the door at the upper rear) to alert security. Somehow, the guy seemed to have seen her, so he walked back up the stairs (he was at the front then) and peer out from the exit, with the intention of going after her. I guess the time that was lapsed allowed her a head start. </font>
<font color="#800000">Yet, I think he changed his mind shortly after stepping out the exit and decided to exit by the front doors and hightail outta there. ‘Cept by the time he did that, he encountered two security guards/policemen. Because the two men didn’t let him through, he decided to pull out his gun and fire shots at them (while the whole auditorium was watching mind you). Luckily, they had bullet proof vest and outfits on, so the bullets merely bounced off their chests. Insanely enough and out of pure desperation, the man fired the gun into the crowd, looking for people to hit–including my sister. But her seat was still empty. I think she didn’t dare to come back in. I instinctly ducked behind the seats to shield myself from being a direct target and from any stray shots.</font>
<font color="#800000">Shortly after, I was back exploring a house again, except this time, I was at my aunt’s new home. It was quite a big house, with 3 bedrooms downstairs, the main floor, and 1 master bedroom with a TV room upstairs.  I ended up looking out her window and saw that there were double-decker buses: green and yellow that looked it they were from HK, but she told me that they transported people to and from the harbour.

<font color="#800000">I remember being in a rush to get to the dock so to catch the ferry. I knew the person in the other car/motorcycle who was also lined up for the ferry.

		<p>				<i>Gift of Discernment?</i> 
My parents had this godly woman over at our house. I was getting a drink while talking to my mom about Auntie Georgina (Becky’s mom). As I got a cup, I asked “Auntie” if she wanted some, but she politely declined. Later on, as I was getting ready to leave with a friend for some hockey event, I recalled that the Auntie’s name was also Georgina…
The weather outside was chilly, so I pondered on what to wear. My friend and I boarded this minivan on our way somewhere…it must have been somewhat hockey related b/c we kept trying to stuff hockey sticks in the car, both the plastic and the wooden ones…
I ended up in this building with many people. Or what looked like people. Many of them were strange. I remember getting into the elevator (ah, another elevator dream!) with a sense of dread…and getting out to see people running around in chaos saying something about avoiding the demons. well, i tried to use the complete opposite tactic. Instead of running, I just slipped quietly here and there, so to not cause attention to myself.
Shortly after, I sensed something following me, so I with this calm of fear, I started to sing “Jesus loves me this I know, for the Bible tells me so…” Apparently, that didn’t quite work and it reached out and touched me. In response, my body flew upwards and I just kinda felt the spirit go into me and quickly burst back out again because I was already claimed as a child of God.
And because I had encountered a demon, I now an impedement … my left leg was weighted down with something but now, I could see who were the spirits and who were the people. With this ability to discern, I tried to evade the spirits from others. One spirit tried to touch a girl in a room (for one touch allows them to possess a person) while they were gambling. But, to protect that girl, I tried to bargain with the spirit, “So, what do you want? 10 dollars?”…I quickly persuaded the girl to give me 20…and handed it to the spirit, “here’s twenty, now leave her alone”.
I wandered about in the halls, but with the influx of people from the elevators and such, I couldn’t really tell right away who were the people and who weren’t. At one point, I passed a note to someone (didn’t know if it was friend or foe at that point) with the word, “Demons?” on it, and he responded, “Champions!” … I knew for sure that it was an indication that my senses were right. The spirits lurked everywhere.
In one room, a few people were chatting and playing games. All of a sudden they heard creaks and noises. Mildred and a few others were scared and ran out to the halls to investigate. I followed knowing that they could not harm me. Turns out, it was only Danny, waking up and coming downstairs to get some toys. I just turned and let Mildred and Danny talk, said good night to Danny and went back to the room…

<i>On headline news:</i><br>
I never knew that there are actually rules to war (“rules of engagement”) as outlined by the Geneva Convention.  Why there are even rules makes no sense, because then it just makes war seem like a game…but life is too precious to be a game..and yet, media makes it out to be a real-life reality show. Logically, the rules may make sense in trying to protect the players as individuals, but practically speaking, I don’t see how both sides will be able to follow them and not allow one side to have an advantage over the other. 19-year-old men and women (or boys and girls perhaps prior to this) fighting for who-knows-what…ending up as PoWs..and their souls? God, have mercy.

<p>
Want this war to end quicker? Eweni suggests that someone just stick a few SARS victims dead centre and infect the whole combat zone and wipe everyone out in the process. Afterall, these two events fight for the top 2 headlines hourly on <a href="http://news.google.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">news.google.com</a>.
</p>



<p>
And this reminds me of what Jesus said (as recorded in Matthew 24:6-14 NLT):</p>

Thus, my “self-glorification” sharing awaits. Actually, as much as sharing often seems self-glorifying as one brother stereotypes sharing as being, when God is the centre of attention (which flows through His people), it’s Him who is glorified! =)
</p>



<p>
<a href="javascript:OpenWindow('impressions.html',%20'width=175')">Impressions</a>: Some noteable people who have impacted my years at UW; this is my “sharing”. There are many I have not mentioned (it would take me eternity to mention all of you) and there are those whose paths may have crossed mine outside the realms of UWCCF, but you still hold a place in my heart and I thank God and thank you.</p>

The tulips have since decayed and fallen, but the digital pictures will hopefully remain (gotten some free prints from FS–we’ll see how they turn out). Frankly, I’m quite pleased with the macro results, as cheap of a camera that I have. Over the past few days, my scroll button my mouse broke too! I’m really annoyed at that, because now I can’t scroll down quickly anymore. My Graphire mouse isn’t as efficient either after using this wireless one…so I guess, it’s time for an optical mouse…gotta wait for a sale :P. Speaking of sales, See Lai Jr. (that would be vonnekins) went to Bluenotes to buy me a pair of pants for $3.99 CDN this week after telling me about the deal–actually, she got some good deals: $3.99 pants/top, $27 fleece-lined jacket. However, she got me a size too small, because there was none left, so I went to Thrifty’s this weekend to exchange it (I didn’t know that they still had that store in Ontario). Now my pants fit nicely :).
</p>



<p>
On Saturday night, Vonne and I took Freddie and Marcy to <a href="http://www.charcoalsteakhouse.ca/charcoal.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Charcoal Steakhouse</a> to celebrate their berfdays (theirs is two days apart from each other). The bill came to $140 btwn the 4 of us including tax and tip; we got “conned” into adding a plate of veggies each as a side, but it was <i>really</i> good stuff–even the mints were yummy, i don’t generally like restaurant mints (they taste like candy cane, which I dislike), but they’re really good (mint covered chocolates)! Normally, I’m not into steak (too heavy for my stomach), but it was really good. Vonne brought her leftover rib dinner home  (it was too big) and because she forgot to bring it back with her, I consumed it in no time at all esp since it would be a waste to throw it out (just had to make sure that she wasn’t sick w anything) :9.

<p>
Grad Dinner: Part II: Events
</p>



<p>
Sunday was CCF’s grad dinner–34 grads. I’m impressed at the result of the work that the grad committee put into it..the food was good–even the cake was delicious–and the multimedia shows were well done! Thank you to those that helped make that night happen! Sadly enough, I think the evening might have been slightly long for I couldn’t even go to MC2034 afterwards for Marcy was tired (bored and slightly cranky) and needed to wake up early the next day to drive some ppl back to Ottawa, and I had to start on a 12% assignment that was due on Monday. I’m still puzzled tho’ at who the baby pictures were of…they never told us! And, why on earth did they put me up twice?!? Other loose ends include: the surveys they sent out, the alphabet list they made…whatever happened to all that data? The survey answers are now blackmailable information for Dan Man! I didn’t get a chance to sign everyone’s autograph books either 😐 Ah, I can’t believe that I almost teared up when Jasy went up there, followed by Eunie, but the whole night seems so surreal; am I actually graduating!? Doesn’t feel like it. I merely feel like an observer watching the whole scene. That’s another reason why I was reluctant to sit at my “designated” table; I didn’t feel like I belonged. Ah well, if I don’t get into any trouble in the next few weeks (on some policies on assignments that slipped my mind until another prof brought it up to our class this week), and pass all my courses, you’re all welcome to attend my convocation on Thursday, June 12 at 14h00. Tho’ I’m still here in the ‘loo til then =). Well, at least I’ll end this last year (hopefully) with a comforting thought that one broken friendship is one its way to its mend (mend not end! :]).
</p>



<p>
Aside: Don’t feel like bloggin’ lately, got nothing to say. Hrm. Gotta talk to God more instead of being addicted to readin’ about others in the bloggin’ community…well, exams are around the corner, you’ll find me at SLC again AWAY from my computer (relief!). w00t! =)

Berfday shouts to Marcy–he’s old. Almost as old as Uncle Andrew.
</p>



<p>
Although B’s tulips below brighten our dull house by a lot, the above picture is quite terrifying. Apparently, everyone in our family, except my brother, has fallen victim to injuries due to car accidents (none of which were any of our faults). My mother, sister, and I have whiplash symptoms (tailbone: moi, sis: spinal/vertebrae problems, mom: neck, back) due to different rear-enders, and my father, well, today he received minor bruises, a cut to the head, headache, and neck/back problems courtesy of a truck who apparently rammed into him while he was stopped. As 911 was called, the police, fireman, and the ambulance came to the rescue. One fireman hacked his way in through the rear window and stuck a brace around my father’s neck, while the other, tried to unjam the stuck door so that they could carry him out onto the stretcher and into the ambulance, to the hospital. After a few x-rays and some poking and prodding, the doctor released him. Right now, he’s at home resting in bed. Thank God that he’s okay (and that no one else was in the car, especially the back seat). Must’ve been guardian angels watching over him! =)
</p>



<p>
Now, the excitement follows. We get a brand new car… w00t! =) My mommy wants a Camry. I think it’s an old folks car, but my brother and my dad are leaning towards the Altima, so I prefer that over the Camry, but I really don’t like the tail-end of the Altima. Shame that they need a car soon, else I’d recommend them getting 2004 models :).</p>

My alarm will ring at 5:45 am tomorrow morning. V needs to get to work. No worries, I will merely fall back asleep. 🙂 As above, I think spring is finally here. Betcha you don’t see many tulips around :). Ah, reminds me of home sweet home … ‘cept we have yellow and red tulips which sprout every spring (assuming the weeds haven’t killed them off by now). All the snow is almost gone, which also means that I only got a chance to snowboard once this season, but lookin’ fwd to the summer.


<p>
And, with the beginnings of rebirth and new life, my dear friend from Grade 8 has just taken a step into new life (2 Corinthians 5:17 (niv) says, “Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation; the old has gone, the new has come”)… =} I’m rejoicing with the angels up above (as well as everyone else i’ve told so far that knows Mel like my parents and my sister). I’m once again reminded that being God’s seed-planter is as much of a blessing as being a harvester (awk sentence i know) :).

<p>
On a political (I tend to avoid these) unrelated note: I wonder how long Canada will not support US’ decisions? I wouldn’t imagine it would be too long for I’m sure the Americans, viz. Bush, can easily attack its friendly peace-making neighbours.</p>

<p> at only +8 celcius, it feels more like 20+C — ppl are donning their shorts and t’s! i guess it’s a big difference from -30C. on sat, i took advantage of the sunny weather by draggin’ steve and daniel first to hmv to buy the $10.99 DVD My Neighbour Totoro (too bad it was only in English), then to Mel’s for breakfast. for the next 3-4 hours, steve n’ i went trigger happy (he taught me a few pters re: using flash indoors..thx!) w my “newly” re-acquired digicam. in the process, showed daniel the “animals” at waterloo park, and walked through waterloo town square. glad we stopped by the barrels on erb (see above pics). im sure ppl thought we were crazy and daniel just looked on…by the time we got home, my socks and shoes and pants were dirty and soaked and well, steve was wearing sandals…hahahah..ahem. yes.
</p>



<p>
i sincerely hope that spring is indeed here! (btw, we haven’t gotten any complaints lately. are you sure that you’re not indirectly correlated w da noise level eunie? :P). had a good (i deem good tho a lil awkward at times) conversation with an old friend today (old can be interpreted at whatever level you choose)…hopefully the season of growth and life will bring about some good changes. argh, quarter-life crisis really bites (see <a href="http://tanklau.blogspot.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tanklau</a>–he termed it). stage of life where there is uncertainty to what lies next.  i think i have the graduation blues. God sure is encouraging. today, jasy told me that one of my sunday school guests from out of town wants to come back because he’s interested in our discussions. definitely His doing. i’ve never seen a student take down notes so vigorously before (quite encouraging that at least someone isn’t bored and is learning from what God instils in their hearts), and well, the class as a whole asks so many interesting questions! i learn so much from them every week 🙂 ahhh, i don’t want to leave them. hahah. i’ve grown so attached unconsciously … and to think that at the beginning of the year/term, i wanted to go back to PT’s ss classes….i think i’ve been very blessed with being able to “teach” them (more like faciliate the class) over these past 3 years. i wouldn’t trade them for any other in the world. trust me. i’ve been victim to bad teachers and bad classes :|.
</p>



<p>
been reading jerms lately. every time i see the word “jeremiah”, i’d think of sandra bullock’s 28 days and hear the chorus “jeremiah was a bull-frog…” every time–never fails. but, jeremiah, the prophet of the OT had a really rough life. i always thought that being a prophet, one would have an interesting life because one would get to be God’s personal messenger. but often, being His messenger would mean that he’d be delivering bad news. bad news = bad reputation and utter dislike for this guy. thus, jerms was imprisoned many a times and no one really liked or listened to him at all. siigh. i donno how i’d handle that. i’m glad im not a prophet! :}</p>

		<p>				w0w,
        it just hit me today. I’ll be a bum after I graduate! I guess that what
        an arts degree will getcha. I’ll be homeless AND jobless. Even worse off
        that some of the BNS-SFU graduates that I know when they were bums. My
        “lease” is up; I’ve lived here for 4 years and as of May 06th, 2003, it’ll
        terminate. Or, more like a new tenant will be moving into my room and
        thus, rendering me homeless. Like most bums, I guess I’ll haveta learn
        to be nomadic. =|
        </p>



<p>
Ah, and once again, I’m reminded that in less than 2 weeks, I’ll be studying for my very last exams (so I hope!). I guess slowly distancing myself from the people around me helps to withdraw from UW long-term :).  Tho’, Candy sent me this e-mail asking me a whole bunch of questions I had no answers for, but I’ll attempt to answer them here since I won’t be appearing in a voice-over or anything for a multimedia presentation at the grad dinner…:
</p>



<p>
Q. What do you think is one of the funniest experience you had at Waterloo?<br>
A. Too many to recall.
</p>



<p>
Q. How about your most memorable experience on campus?<br>
A. *shrugs*. How about when I was a deliquent child and almost got charged for hacking? =P
</p>



<p>
Q. Any stories about other grads? What are they?<br>
A. It would help if I knew who the other grads are. I was just commenting to a few ppl today that everyone else knows who’s graduating ‘cept for the grads. Heheh :). Although, I must share that story that I told you earlier (Feb?)–remember about a guy checking E out in first year? Well, E was Euming :). I have other grad stories too about who liked them and stuff, but I won’t tell you to protect their identities :P.
</p>



<p>
Q. Is there anything you regret not doing or something you wish you have done differently?<br>
A. Yeah, I wish I figured out early on that I wasn’t meant to be in Optometry. Then, I wouldn’t have had to take Organic or Genetics (or other horrid non-biology related courses for almost 3 years before realising my mistake)! Oh yes, I shouldn’t have gotten lazy in doing daily sit/push-ups. =|
</p>



<p>
Q. What advices would you give to others, the undergrads, the frosh?<br>
A. Others? Sleep. Don’t hack. If you do learn, cover your tracks well. However, if you must suffer academically b/c you spend too much time working on your webpage or bloggin’, it might do you some good; it brought me to my current program (where i do learn about design and web technology stuff!) and an exciting career to look forward to (in my dreams if I’m a bum) :).
<br>Undergrads? Sleep. Take care of the Frosh.
<br>Frosh? Serve. UW will try to weed you out this year. Ignore them. Work hard and play hard!
</p>



<p>
Q. What are your hopes for CCF?<br>
A. A bigger room/meeting location; the people will get to know one another on a more intimate basis; and,that MCCF will continue on, as well as CCCF with leaders willing to serve and to disciple those to lead/serve for the future.
</p>



<p>
Q. What kind of things are you going to take away with you from the 5 years experience, CCF, school etc.?<br>
A. CCF: The gentlemen are quite gentlemanly–willing to walk girls home, even in the opposite direction. I had no idea, as a frosh, that such guys existed (unless those that were mackin’).<br>
School: Praise God, He managed to get me through academically EVERY term! Funny, Dr. Wong once said that if you serve on committee, don’t be surprised if (not a guarantee) you see your marks suddenly soaring; he was right.<br>
Etc.: I pray that my teens will grow up to serve and love God with their utmost and impact the generation to come. I learned sooo much from them! =) 10Q! =)
</p>



<p>
Q. Any embarrasment moments?<br>
A. I think you meant embarassing…and hrm. I’m sure there are, but I choose to conveniently have amensia at such points in life :).
</p>



<p>
Q. Fav. quotes for other ppl from CCF? Or your own?<br>
A. None. I’m not good at quoting from people or from myself. The Bible serves me well in this area :).<br> Here are some notables in the last 5 years:<br>
Year 1: Jeremiah 2:17 (NLT): “O Sovereign LORD! You have made the heavens and earth by your great power. Nothing is too hard for you!”<br>
Year 2: “…of making many books there is no end, and much study wearies the body.” Ecclesiastes 12:12b<br>
Year 3: Hrm, that year I didn’t write any down. Not a good sign.<br>
Year 4: Micah 6:8 (NIV): “No, O people, the LORD has already told you what is good, and this is what he requires: to do what is right, to love mercy, and to walk humbly with your God.”<br>
Year 5: which reminds me, I should start writing the memorable verses down again 😛<br>
And, from George MacDonald from <i>The Curate’s Awakening</i> (that I don’t recall reading):
If doubts have never been yours, if perhaps your belief is but the shallow absences of doubt, then you must ask yourself a question: Do you love your faith so little that you have never battled a single fear lest your faith should not be true? For what are doubts but the strengthening building blocks toward summits of yet higher faith in Him who always leads us into high places? Where there no doubts, no questions, no perplexities, there can be no growth into the regions where He would have us walk. Doubts are only means through which He can enlarge our spiritual selves.”
Q. What are you thankful for for the past 5 years?<br>
A. God (and Answered Prayers). Life. Friends. In that order. Family is in there somewhere as well :).
</p>



<p>
Q. What is the most remarkable thing that God has done with your life at university?<br>
A. Showed me that He does not fail. Ever. Especially when it comes to answered prayers. Developed passion in me in areas where previously thought impossible. Ah yes, see also my previous thoughts.
</p>



<p>
Q. What is greatest blessing that God has given you for the past 5 years?<br>
A. Vonnnekins! :). Friendships, especially when I needed them most (I don’t make and keep close friends too easily especially those that are girls). Ah, yes, did I mention answered prayers? 🙂
</p>



<p>
Q. When and how were you the most encouraged by your peers, by CCFers, by friends?<br>
A. Peers: Science years were the most encouraging. Arts years? Um. I don’t know my classmates too well. =|  That answers the when..not sure about how ‘cept they just were. 🙂<br>
CCFers: Many a times. How? Being living testimonies w/o consciously trying to be.
<br>Friends: Sacrifice (time, energy, etc.).
</p>



<p>
Q. What are some of your pet peeves?<br>
A. According to my “black” book that I wrote in in 1996(?), they are: second-hand smoke, people who try to watch TV/play computer games and talk to you on the phone at the same time (ie. ppl who can’t multi-task but think they can). Tons others that have since popped up.
</p>



<p>
Q. When was the time that you feel God’s presence the most strongest?<br>
A. I’d say first year. When things weren’t quite as routine and everything was still fresh and new.</p>
