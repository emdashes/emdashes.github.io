It seemed like we were in a dating networking event, as we were supposed to dance with whomever asked you to dance. I did, but had no interest in the guy who asked me to dance.

After going down the stairs and out the glass doors into another part of the building, I ended up seeing someone I knew when I paused to stop to watch 4-5 people demonstrating how to shower when back-country camping.]]>		</p>

		<p>				Language


In under two playdates with a 4-year old, her English vocabulary and frequency of use has exploded; now, it’s almost as if her English switch gets turned on as soon as she steps into her play area. Whether she use words in the right context, or put together nonsensical sentences or words which I know is her attempt at English, she isn’t afraid to try – and persist when we don’t understand her. When she first started speaking (signing and Cantonese), we understood her – it was almost as if she saved up all she learned before speaking, so this babbling is new to us! I’m certain she understands more than she can express, which generally happens when one learns a new language; it’s easier to pick up a language when reading and listening than speaking and writing.
As I listen to her speak more and more English day after day (which I worry she might soon forget her Chinese), I wonder how much more quickly we would pick up a language if we adults approached language learning that way: not being afraid to just go for it even when you might not make sense.
For some of her Cantonese, sometimes I can tell who she has picked it up from based on the words she uses. For example, if I hear “啜筒” (<em>zyut tung</em>), I know it’s from Joseph and his side of the family, because I say “飲筒” (<em>yum tung</em>); likewise with “裡<span class="hps">頭</span>” (<em>lui tou</em>), I say “裏邊/面” (<em>lui bian/mian</em>) instead.


</p><h3>Music</h3>


She still enjoys singing songs and will spontaneously break out in song all day long, especially ones with actions – either ones that she’s been singing at Music and Movement, the library, or ones I’ve been teaching her – so I am trying o find Christian songs that are easy to learn in Cantonese to pass on (so far, I’ve managed <em>Jesus Loves Me</em> with 2 missing words, and parts of two other songs I sang in my childhood).


<h3>Colours and Letters</h3>

She’s also at the point where she will make and remember associations, so I’ve found success with helping her identify colours and alphabet letters, although sometimes, she will just say  the association, like “Daddy” instead of “D” – but I know that she recognizes that letter now, because she says the same association every time. Other letters she recognizes is O, “Breanna” or “Baby” B, “mama” E (maybe because of my name?), “doggie-bone” I, sometimes “moon-crescent” C and “snake” S,  and consistently “Leia P” (but it’s really an A). This opens up new activities to try, such as at restaurants, instead of doing word search on the kids menu, we do letter search.
For colours, we’ve progressed from doggie brown to sunshine yellow and fire engine red – and she just somehow knows the colour green, so it’s her favourite colour of the moment. She can sometimes also identify cloud/blueberry blue, purple and pink. With her new-found love for green, she has also begun to collect objects of the same colour and sort them.

She has started to assert more independence (which often leads to doing especially when told not to do), or wanting to do more things on her own, so I’ve asked her to help me get a diaper and wipe when changing her brother, pick out her table setting and bring it to the table at meal times, (re)wash her bib after she’s done with it, and let her figure out how to put on a pair of elastic-waist pants and bite my tongue when it ends up being backwards.

I know many children at this age can put on clothes, socks, jackets, etc. but we haven’t mastered those skills yet. Toilet-training is also slow progress – some days she knows and will tell me she needs to go, and other days, she is happy to pee in her training underwear and not care or seem to notice the couch has gotten wet (still thankful she self-trained for poop for over a year now).

Meals are still spent half self-feeding, with help from an adult once she gets bored with self-feeding (or isn’t as hungry anymore), especially with food choices that aren’t as easy to self feed because it requires utensils or may be messier, like soup noodles or rice with <em>soong</em>; she can pretty much eat an entire sandwich or a serving of sushi rolls on her own though.

When it comes to art and drawing, she’s starting to be able to trace around objects and the other day, she coloured within the lines – we have yet to find out if that was an accident or not.

		<p>				Life


</p><h3>The old has gone…</h3>


2015 was when the life of our house starts to show; the year that our house breaks down (actually both of them do). Whether you rent or own, there’s the everyday and the occasional deep cleaning you need to do to up-keep the place, but when you own, there’s more at stake.


<h4>The yard</h4>




<ul><li>From previous years: <strong>Patio</strong> needs work and repair – sealing, paint, and replacing some rotted planks (unresolved)</li>


    

<li><strong>Fence door / gate</strong> falls off its hinges. Our neighbour’s gate also had that happen to her sometime later; ours got fixed, but hers is still broken (we should help her get hers up again)</li>


</ul><h4>The kitchen</h4>




<ul><li><strong>Oven</strong>: has more and more mini-explosions (I think still unresolved after some attempts at cleaning it)</li>


    

<li><strong>Microwave</strong>: would randomly stop working mid-cycle and would have to unplug and plug it back to reboot it. By the end of the year, I finally decided to redeem airmiles for a smaller, more stylish – and functional – microwave</li>


    

<li><strong>Kitchen light</strong>: In June or July, it stops working. First one bulb would turn on only on occasion or it would take hours before it would turn on, then eventually the three bulbs stopped powering on right away. Eventually,  my father-in-law manages to revive two of the three bulbs and it has worked like that since.</li>


    

<li>In July, we find an abundance of <strong>fruit flies</strong>, from a bag of molding carrots and beets that our housemate left behind and then some <strong>plant gnats</strong> in our indoor basil and single window plant (seems to be all gone now, phew)</li>


    

<li>That same month, the <strong>air conditioning</strong> stops blowing cool air in the middle of a heat wave; it would work again when you turned it off, wait a bit, and then back on. Upon further investigation, the external unit stopped working when it became encased in ice, which explained why it worked fine the AC didn’t need to be turned on for a long time. The technician added some coolant and tried a couple of other tricks to prolong its life, but we ultimately replaced it late August / early September.</li>


</ul><h4>The basement</h4>




<ul><li>A month earlier, in June: the <strong>basement</strong> floods from a torrential, sideways down-pour of rain (happened and stopped within 1 hour); it seems the water seeped through the window from an overflowing window well that didn’t drain properly (two likely factors: drain got buried without us knowing; and, our windows are bigger, which makes them lower to the ground). At least our friend had good use of the basement for 5 months. Thankfully, the dry wall seems in tact and we have a sunken basement so flood was relatively contained and we only need to replace the laminate floor boards in that one area, and there doesn’t seem to be any mold damage. Ridiculously, our insurance told us that they wouldn’t cover our house anymore if we didn’t get it repaired even though they also said “seepage” wasn’t covered anyway.</li>


    

<li>Fast forward a few months, in September, our <strong>other basement</strong> floods. As a result, the ugly green carpet is removed in no time, and we discover a mysterious hole under the bar area (where the sump pump was once, perhaps?). The water comes through a side wall, and we later realize it was because the sump pump failed and the water was probably from a combination of rain and the neighbour watering the grass at the side of the house. Insurance estimates the damage to be at least 10K, but doesn’t cover it either as j.w didn’t realize he had to specifically request coverage for it (I made sure our house had it)</li>


</ul><h4>The bedroom</h4>




<ul><li><strong>Ceiling</strong>: we find a streak of water mark other than the patch from the ice storm years ago. A few months later, when we got an insulation consultation, the guy explains that it’s from condensation from a lack of insulation, reassuring us that it’s not actually our roof that’s leaking (and that it still has a good few years of life left and that lighter colour shingles take less wear than darker ones)</li>


    

<li><strong>Mattress</strong>: at the end of my pregnancy, I realized that I sagged into my mattress, and rotating it didn’t help. Upon further inspection, I noticed two distinct imprints / indents that didn’t go away. We took a chance on a $270 box spring+mattress deal at the beginning of 2016 from Sears and it’s already feeling a lot better.</li>

<div> 2015 was also the year where many things took on new life: <a href="http://her.happyhippos.ca/2015/11/zoom-zoom/">a car</a>, the addition of extended family members (two <a href="http://her.happyhippos.ca/2015/07/california-road-trip/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">weddings</a>), <a href="http://her.happyhippos.ca/2015/12/its-another-baby/">a baby</a> (and answered prayers of friends who have tried and are finally expecting!), and new friendships outside of our church community – <span style="font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.75;">especially this one crazy reconnection…</span></div>




<div> </div>




<div>…As a UXer (<em>think that’s a made up word), </em>I like to stay connected with the community and the industry by keeping up with the monthly meetups in our local UX group. However, I think I recall only going to two events in the past two plus years – so when the meetup.com description mentioned a name of a speaker I thought I recognized, I signed up to attend! Sure enough, she was someone I knew from my high school days, <em>all the way from BC</em> – we had volunteered together at a science camp for kids at SFU one summer, and for some reason, I remembered her (I only remember her name, 2 campers, and one other person I knew). Who knew that fast forward two plus decades, we would meet again on the other side of the country, and that we’re both in the same industry and play board games? (come to think of it, the other volunteer that I knew is an active board gamer too). Because of her, we’ve been introduced to her high school and university friend (who has also settled here) and his family, and so now we know another couple with kid(s) and Bean has another friend / playmate closer to her age than our friends (they also happen to know another set of our friends via their daughter’s school and the wife’s profession); God sure knows who to send at the right time!</div>




<div> </div>




<div> </div>




<div>So why am I only writing this now? Well, I started it mid-year but didn’t get a chance to finish until today, so as j.w says, it’s the yearly review, lunar year style. Happy lunar new year –  I look forward to seeing what 2016 will bring us!</div>

		<p>				oh wait, she can!), when we got home and paid closer attention to it specifically, we realize that he’s been doing it for awhile now; he actually thrives on social interaction, people singing to him, and watching people go about their activities when he’s not tired.
It appears that like his sister, he’s also stopped pooping at night after one month, which makes diaper changes a lot easier in dim light (and alo less urgent). These days, he tends to go in the afternoon or late morning every other day. He also has cradle cap and mild patches of eczema on his legs like his sister, so that gene didn’t skip him.
But sadly, I admit defeat and have caved in to giving him a pacifier to soothe him; I feel like I’m going to regret my actions of introducing a soother later when it’s time to wean. He seems to look for his hand or something to suck on when he’s sleepy, which is something Bean didn’t take (or maybe I just didn’t try very hard because she would just use her tongue to thrust it out of her mouth and continue crying), so I take the “easier” way out and it saves my body from having to wear him, nurse him, or hold him to sleep.  The one downside is that when it falls out, he often wakes up crying, but the stretch of peace I have allows me to do a little, like start this blog post, load and start the dishwasher as quietly as possible, and make lunch.
Like his sister, visual stimulations seem to distract him or keep him from falling asleep, so he does well with a muslin (breathable) blanket over his head like a hood, which works when I wear him and draped over his play yard bassinet. (yes, I know some will frown upon it citing safety reasons and yet, many parents still take calculated risks in their parenting journey and this is one of them for us).
The biggest and most surprisingly of all, is his night-time sleep. He can regularly sleep 5 hour stretches now (usually from late evening until the middle of the night), and last night, he even did 7 hours (I realized my milk supply wasn’t ready for that and now I have a bettter understanding for the imagery for “my cup runneth over” ~ <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm+23%3A5&version=KJV;ESV" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Psalm 23:5</a>). I don’t expect this to happen regularly this early on, but I count this as a blessing and enjoy it while it lasts (before the next growth spurt)! :)]]>		</p>

		<p>				Some Chinese traditions celebrate a baby’s one month (full moon / month), two-month (double full moon 雙滿月), or 100 day birthday. And from <a href="http://www.aeroportodesign.com/portfolio/double-full-moon-party/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">online photos</a>, the banquets are as extravagant as wedding receptions, which seem a little over the top – though, I guess if a new mom is trapped at home with babe for 30 days with a Chinese postpartum doula, she will have some free time to plan an event like this!  </p></div>




<div class="markedForCaretMarkerRemoval" dir="auto"> </div>




<div class="markedForCaretMarkerRemoval" dir="auto">We actually hosted a more informal celebration for Bean’s one month but this time around, the first month flew by quickly, likely because we had less time with a toddler in the house and the Christmas and new year season. With that excuse, and because many people were away over Christmas and New Year’s, we didn’t host a one-month/full-moon gathering for baby brother. So instead, we decided to host <span class="markedForCaretMarkerRemoval">an even more casual two-month get-together (over coffee and baked goodies) with friends for her brother followed by a 100 day Chinese banquet-style dinner with family and relatives in Toronto, since it wouldn’t be fair to host one for her but not for him! #secondchildsyndrome. But we’re probably far from being traditional, considering we opted to use a barn and a coffee shop as two atypical venues for an event like this – we’re taking advantage of this tradition not to show off the baby (ie. official revealing of babe after confinement!), but to thank our family and friends for their friendship and support in our parenting ups and downs. </span></div>




<div class="markedForCaretMarkerRemoval" dir="auto"><span class="markedForCaretMarkerRemoval"> </span></div>




<div class="markedForCaretMarkerRemoval" dir="auto"><span class="markedForCaretMarkerRemoval">As predicted, little brother is in many ways the opposite of Bean‎: enjoys motion and fixing his eyes on movement – the swing and mobile is a sanity saver this time around! and he doesn’t get car sick and wail in car rides when the car is in motion; falls asleep and sleeps relatively well, not getting night and day mixed up; eats a lot but spitting up almost daily which means loads of laundry, though still healthily gaining weight to show for all the input (at the 6 week discharge appointment, he was almost 9lb 7oz, surpassing Bean’s 8lbs) and thus easier to hold as a result as he feels less fragile; cradle cap, though present isn’t as severe as his sister’s; his hiccups don’t correspond as well to his bowel movements; and, sadly, he doesn’t seem to have a newborn smell (all I smell is sweat and breast milk – grandma says he smells like a boy). Little brother also has a tendency to smile right before dozing off (other grandma made this observation first). Now at 2 months, he’s 50th percentile in weight, roughly 60-70 percentile in length, and has a large head; he’s a chunky 13lbs (almost half of his sister, who at 2.5yo is a little over 25lb, who sits on the 5th percentile on either weight or height categories), and I’m thankful that my milk supply is better this time around (both in quantity and creamy look) which helps sustain this oft-hungry babe, feeding 2-3 hours on a good stretch – which might also be because he’s a boy. A $40 etsy ring sling has been a lifesaver for us, as we can babywear and have him sleep or hold him while we do other things – like assist the toddler in my case. </span></div>




<div class="markedForCaretMarkerRemoval" dir="auto"><span class="markedForCaretMarkerRemoval"> </span></div>




<div class="markedForCaretMarkerRemoval" dir="auto"><span class="markedForCaretMarkerRemoval">Big sister is adapting well to having a baby brother for the most part.  I’m pleasantly surprised that she seems to enjoy having him around – sharing some of her toys and blankets with him, wanting to help with getting wipes and diapers for him, and pushing his swing. She has made one of her (my) dolls into her “baby” and has at times nursed her and burped her in the same way that baby brother is burped (which is very cute). ‎But there are moments where I know is hard for her and she has daily meltdowns over the littlest things – perhaps because her coping mechanism, “terrible twos”, or that I miss her tired cues because I’m juggling two. We’re also at a point where she’s growing up even more: she’s almost completely weaned (a gradual thing when I noticed she could delatch on cue – by counting to 20 during pregnancy and then in the past month, we dropped it by saying you don’t need it when it’s dark and we opt to sing songs instead. Naps were harder since she used to rely on nursing to fall asleep – which might also be a reason for more tears these days right before nap time), and now she’s started to want to wear training underwear and successfully pee in the toilet three times over the course of lunch or not peeing her pants, after one time of doing so and telling me about it. Perhaps the visitors have helped, but since the arrival of baby brother, she seems more content in playing independently or with me watching from the couch while nursing instead of making me sit beside her like she used to, which is a nice change. ‎</span></div>




<div class="markedForCaretMarkerRemoval" dir="auto"><span class="markedForCaretMarkerRemoval"> </span></div>




<div class="markedForCaretMarkerRemoval" dir="auto"><span class="markedForCaretMarkerRemoval">Her command of the English language seems to have suddenly exploded – with words she uses (in the almost correct context) that I didn’t even know she knew, which she probably picked up from either her English-speaking friends or the programs she joins! There are also times when I know she’s trying to say something in English but I have no idea what she’s saying. At two and a half, s‎</span><span class="markedForCaretMarkerRemoval">he’s still generally a cautious person, dislikes attention from unfamiliar people, and learns by quietly observing and mimicking, but loves to sing and be silly.‎</span><span class="markedForCaretMarkerRemoval"> But whether it is “terrible twos”, seeking competing attention, or firstborn syndrome, I can tell she is very opinionated (many of her sentences start with “I want to…”) and is very feisty at times. I can still reason with her for the most part, when I tell her to do or not to do (or can’t have) something, but lately, there are times when I tell her not to do whatever she’s doing, she will intentionally repeat it. ‎She doesn’t like it when I threaten and start counting to three, which means I either get reluctant but abiding co-operation or a complete meltdown (though she can be full-on crying one second, and the faucet turns off completely the next – how??). And in times like these, </span><span class="markedForCaretMarkerRemoval">I think, she’s a mirror of my sinful nature: how often does God tell us not to do something, and we willfully disobey?‎</span><span class="markedForCaretMarkerRemoval">‎</span></div>

		<p>				 I went to bed close to 1AM, but my fitbit correctly detected that I didn’t actually get a chance to sleep until past 4AM[/caption]
While I usually welcome routine and structure, I feel like I am wasting my days away in too much routine lately, to the point where every day feels the same. Perhaps it’s cabin fever from postpartum confinement that seems like time is dragging, and yet, he’s almost three weeks old, and I only have 10ish days left before I can freely leave the house (without feeling guilty or lectured at) whether to get some fresh air or a change in environment.
Even with help, I’m feeling drained and spent; I don’t know how single parents or those whose spouses are away do it – kudos to them. One huge advantage of the postpartum confinement practice is the help: I can get away from not having to do dishes, cook meals, change as many diapers, and entertain the toddler so I can feed the baby on demand,  get some shut-eye to make up for the little sleep I get at night. When help – in the form of either set of parents – leaves, I worry most about how to juggle the sleep schedules with two (bad parenting habits on our part as some would say, as the toddler requires too much help to fall asleep). I also hope I can figure out a way to connect with my daughter again because right now, I feel like mommy doesn’t have fun with her anymore; instead, mommy is just around to help her do things (like change diapers, feed her, bedtime routine, take her to the toilet, wash her hands) – which is probably why she’s even more resistant to other people helping her do these things these days, and would on occasion breakdown or have an outburst as a result.
Lately, a typical day looks like: <span style="color: #008000;">feed baby</span>, <span style="color: #008000;">change diaper</span>, <span style="color: #ff9900;">eat a meal</span>, <span style="color: #ff00ff;">feed toddler</span>, <span style="color: #008000;">feed baby</span>, <span style="color: #ff00ff;">put toddler down for a nap (short bedtime routine)</span>, <span style="color: #ff9900;">power nap or laundry</span>, <span style="color: #008000;">feed baby</span>, <span style="color: #ff00ff;">tend to toddler who has woken up within the hour</span>, <span style="color: #800080;">change diapers on both</span>, <span style="color: #ff9900;">eat another meal</span>, <span style="color: #ff00ff;">feed toddler</span>,<span style="color: #008000;"> feed baby</span>, <span style="color: #ff00ff;">persuade the toddler to fall sleep (long bedtime routine)</span>, <span style="color: #008000;">feed baby</span>, <span style="color: #ff9900;">some down time and snacks</span>, and repeat the following until the morning: <span style="color: #008000;">feed baby</span>, <span style="color: #ff9900;">nap</span>, <span style="color: #008000;">feed baby</span>, <span style="color: #008000;">change diaper</span>, <span style="color: #008000;">feed baby</span>,<span style="color: #ff00ff;"> settle toddler</span>. (<span style="color: #008000;">green</span>: baby, <span style="color: #ff9900;">orange</span>: me, <span style="color: #ff00ff;">pink</span>: toddler)
Nights are the hardest because when I’m not sleeping, I silently will my husband to share in misery instead of serenely sleeping away or wonder why my toddler can’t easily be consoled by daddy when she wakes up in the middle of the night (and decides to cry for an hour instead).  I know these aren’t very nice (or godly) thoughts and I know it gets better eventually, but it doesn’t mean that they escape me. There has been a week of reprieve, where he actually followed a nice 2-3 hour feeding schedule, and slept nicely in between. <del>Sadly, it didn’t last and was too good to be true.</del>  At the time I started writing this post, he decided to feed every 1-2 hours nightly for a few days likely due to a growth spurt, but last night, it was nice to be back on a 2-3 hour sleep cycle again (funny how 2-3 hours is what to look forward these days). Though, it’s nice to have caught up with my Netflix playlist as a result.
The past few weeks have gone by quickly in terms of baby’s growth: he lost 10% of his birth weight, but recovered 1 kg within a week. Perhaps it’s because the midwife wisely waited until he grew a bit before doing the heel poke for the newborn tests, but he didn’t even flinch or cry when she drew blood. While he easily tucked into my arms before, his feet now stick out when he’s feeding. He gurgles and snorts and makes all sorts of funny expressions and noises, and while he slept through all sorts of background noises the second week, it seems like he’s starting to want to be held more during the day. He’s also prone to burp and regularly spit up (even from his nose, poor guy), which I guess makes up for all the two times Bean did.
This is why babies are hard work! I’m reminded why I started to enjoy being with and interacting with Bean more after she was 6 months old – by then, I probably would have a better hang of things with two as well.]]>		</p>

Two members of our family share a birthday with celebrities: Prince George and Max Zuckerberg. While we had a <a href="http://www.therecord.com/news-story/3904661-couple-s-little-princess-arrives-same-day-as-prince/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">unexpected birth announcement</a> in our local paper with Bean, this babe didn’t share the same announcement with Facebook’s $45 billion philanthropic birth announcement.
A few weeks earlier, I had posted <a href="http://her.happyhippos.ca/2015/11/one-month-countdown/">a poll on this blog</a> and to select groups on my Facebook feed to see what guesses for our babe’s gender and delivery date would be this time around, and based on the responses, the majority of participants guessed that the baby would be a boy, and the most common guess for day was December 2 (not sure if it’s because I told many people my guess – I figured if I was in early labour starting December 1, I would deliver by December 2). The signs this time around pointed to the baby being a boy, which included buying boy-tagged clothing, receiving gifts that have a slight color-bias to a boy, and only having a name picked out for a boy (the opposite happened with Bean) so perhaps subconsciously I knew. My mother and my sister-in-law won for guessing the right date and gender, with my mother being closest in time (though, I tell her that her guess doesn’t count because I was already talking about early labour symptoms in our family chat when she submitted her guess).

</p><h3>Birth Story</h3>


Like many birth stories, some people – especially those who are not yet parents or health professionals – may find that the following content may be too graphic / contain too much information. Reader discretion advised.
I’ve found out that despite similar pregnancy symptoms, you can’t count on having similar labour and birth stories between babies even within the same family! With Bean, from first contractions to delivery, it was short and relatively pain-free: it lasted 24 hours; but with this one, it felt long, painful, and drawn out, with mild contractions and rectal pressure starting on the Thursday and baby delivered by Tuesday. One redeeming factor, however: active labour – from when I was first directed to push – lasted only 17 minutes, as opposed to 4-6 hours. If I was asked which I would prefer, I think in hindsight, this one was probably the better choice, but in the moment, I would have probably told you that I would have preferred one that didn’t feel so painful.
Since we almost had an accidental home birth with Bean the first time around, and it wasn’t a bad start, I considered trying at home when presented with the option this time for a few reasons: I wanted to prove (especially to both our mothers) that it was a safe alternative to a hospital birth; being at home cooler months meant that there is no need to shuttle mom+baby in the cold, in construction, and having to find/pay for parking; and we both liked the midwife who didn’t yet have local hospital privileges but could do home births. It’s a good thing too, because we would’ve likely been in and out of the hospital in under 3 hours.
I knew that D-day (doomsday and/or delivery day) was coming closer and closer when I kept having multiple bladder accidents, especially en route to the bathroom after not moving for a while (eg. waking up in the middle of the night). When mild contractions and mild urges for a bowel movement came on the Thursday evening while I was out volunteering at the Operation Christmas Child processing centre, I texted j.w to get things packed and ready to go. The mild contractions seem to have subsided by Sunday, but by Monday, I started to see some pink bloody mucous discharge and felt some mild menstrual-like cramping pains in the morning, intensifying with back pain and rectal pressure with each cramp. That evening, my contractions were more regular, with it peaking at 6-1-1 (six minutes apart for 1 minute for 1 hour), so I was starting to think that I would have the baby in the middle of the night, especially since my sleep was constantly being interrupted starting at 3 AM. I tried to time them using my Fitbit so that I could get some visual data later, but turns out, none of the tracking was recorded and later on, when I was chatting with support, they told me I had found a system bug! (boo)
Of course, as a second-time father,  j.w didn’t seem to give much thought to them or show any urgency, for even on Tuesday morning when I asked if he could work from home for the day, he proceeded to go to a work conference. Later that day, when I tried to ask him to come home because I was going to page the midwife to come, the impression I got was that free lunch trumped coming home earlier, although he did offer to pick something up for me I suppose.
The first time I paged the midwife on the recommendation of the office administrator at the clinic, I asked if Tylenol+gravol was safe to take during the day for pain management (yes, every 4 hours). When she heard that I was experiencing contractions, she offered to come for a home visit early evening and cancel my appointment in the afternoon. A couple of hours later, I called again asking if she could come any earlier as my contractions felt more intense – thankfully, she did because after an initial assessment, it turns out she already felt the baby’s head and I was 8 cm dilated. This was when she said I better call j.w to tell him to come home immediately – thankfully he was already en route. Although our primary midwife (Beau) has only been practicing post-graduation since August of this year (which had my mother-in-law concerned about her experience), she diplomatically told her that we were going to try for a home birth first when my mother-in-law asked about going to the hospital (even though MIL knew that we decided to do that already). It’s a good thing that my mother-in-law didn’t overhear the midwives (jokingly?) say that Beau haven’t ruptured membranes before, but she managed to break the water and with a ‘pop’, the fluid gushed out – this time on a sheet since it was planned so it didn’t soak the carpet. Good thing our TENS machine still worked as the midwife’s was out on loan – it took the edge off each contraction. I later asked if I would have ever gotten to 10 cm without membrane intervention or to 5-1-1, she did say that some people just never get to 5-1-1. I also later found out that even if I had asked for the laughing gas, I would’ve been too far along to have been able to use it.
She called the backup midwife + student midwife and after some walking up and down the stairs to get things moving along, they ended up recommending that I do lunges on the stairs, which were tremendously difficult to get through. Of course, the contractions started to slow down once I stopped moving, but after swallowing some labour tincture, and sending j.w to fetch the electric breast pump in hopes that will trigger the uterus to get more contractions going, the midwives somehow managed to coax a few contractions out without it and directed me to push the baby out in those weak contractions (instead of waiting for the natural urge to push – and it seemed that I pushed even after the contraction was over). Beau’s advice helped tremendously, but I’m still not sure why to this day: tuck in chin, hold breath, and push into the pain. The worst part was between contractions, waiting for them especially since it felt like there was a baby stuck waiting for the next push. I later remembered that we had this problem with Bean: my contractions were always short and didn’t seem to last enough for a big push. 
Was there a ring of fire this time? I’m not sure; I was already moaning through gritted teeth and tears (so maybe that’s why my jaw was sore a day or so after!). Within 17 minutes (and 3 hours since the midwife first came), the baby was out! This one was 1 lb heavier than Bean – which also proved that my body CAN push a baby out that was larger than Bean (last OB said that if Bean was any larger, she would’ve needed a C-section). After declining to touch babe as it was emerging because of the slime and goop, I first saw babe’s face and then they unwrapped the towel and showed me that it was a boy! j.w missed it so instead of telling him, I just let him see himself. This time, he also had the honours of cutting the umbilical cord after some babe to mom skin-to-skin time (delayed cord clamping).
I don’t remember noticing the birth of the placenta last time, though I know it came out, but this time though quick, it wasn’t without some pain. I think it was sped up with a shot of oxytocin. The midwives also stitched me up (black dissolvable thread with local anesthesia) as I had a natural second-degree tear and I appreciated that they calmly tried to stop the moderate amount of bleeding that is post-partum hemorrhage (apparently I lost more blood than necessary – and they check by pressing on your uterus / belly to see if it’s firmed up and if any blood gushes out) – with the help of some dissolvable tablet under the tongue and an IV drip (of oxytocin?); each of the midwives have enough supplies for a “mini Cambridge hospital” in their car, so they can attend to little emergencies like this.  A catheter was uncomfortably put in but taken out pretty much right away after emptying my bladder, unlike at the hospital which stayed in for the duration of the delivery.  A few times, I wanted to doze off, but they didn’t let me because of the amount of blood that I lost. Not too long after, my body had the shakes and chills, which was accompanied by a fever so the midwife stuck around for a bit longer – thankfully it dissipated by morning, which meant it wasn’t a sign of an infection (or a piece of placenta left inside).  Apparently the midwife doesn’t leave until you can tell them that you can pee (and apparently mothers tend to find it easiest to do a first pee in the shower).
In the end, the basement worked out to be a great place to do everything: I got a chance to nap in peace on a double bed as j.w took shifts with the baby, the lights were dimmable and at its brightest setting, brighter than our bedroom and the bathroom was just steps away; it was also more spacious and laminate floors are easier to clean than carpet. The midwives help with some clean-up: they bagged the placenta, garbage in another, and laundry in a garbage bag; I  that all blood stains came out in the wash completely!  
My body down there seems to have recovered quicker than the first, but there seem to be more muscle aches and pains, with the pecs being the worst so I can no longer lift Bean (not sure if it was from poor posture breastfeeding or as Beau puts it, your body has gone through a marathon). I’ve already lost 10 lbs the first day (of the 20lb I gained) so we’ll see if it’ll bounce back to shape quickly.


<h3>First Days</h3>


The first days have been challenging, with him sleeping nicely during the day, but not wanting to sleep on his own at night. This isn’t new to us, as Bean had her night and day switched as well. Milk supply hasn’t been too bad either, with him losing 10% on day 3, but gaining again by day 6. This time, I have started using a <a href="https://www.motherlove.com/product/more-milk-plus-alcohol-free" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">herbal tincture by motherlove </a>on the recommendation of my midwife. I just found out that the herbs are only effective for the few 2ish weeks so I better start taking it more regularly.
I should have been prepared that he would be the one to spit up though, since Bean has ever only spit up/thrown up twice in her lifespan.  Maybe because there was some tiny milk supply left in me to begin with that he actually had more than the recommendation soiled diapers for the first couple of days (the number of day should match the number of soiled diapers).
Bean seems to take to baby brother well for the most part (eg. wants to hold him, say goodbye to him, ask what about what he is doing), but I think there are difficult moments for her – as it is for me – as she sometimes breaks down or have out bursts over things that she normally wouldn’t. I miss spending time with her, and while I know she misses certain things that I do with her, she seems to find solace in others right now (or looks to others instead of to me), which is good but I feel a mother’s guilt and a bit sad too that I can’t be there for her for things that she used to ask mama to do with her.]]>
