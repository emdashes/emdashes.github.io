		<p>				Well, since I have been posting about our last few various trips, I might as well catch up before falling behind again.</p>




<p>This past Canadian Thanksgiving weekend, we decided for some American history. Two of us girls decided to take the overnight Metrobus from Toronto to Washington, DC. For me, it was my first time in DC, so I relied on D to know the highlights of the area. She had researched the museums and memorial ahead of time and compiled a list of museums that we should visit.</p>




<p><a title="IMG_9347 by b.p., on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aimeili/6236418731/"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6031/6236418731_01362a9f33.jpg" alt="IMG_9347" width="400" height="266"></a>﻿</p>




<p>I looked forward to a couple of museums, specifically the Lego exhibition at the National Building Archives Museum and the Air and Space Museum at the Smithsonian. While the first had a nominal fee for students, all the Smithsonian museums are free! However, I was a little bit disappointed: the Air and Space Museum, while good (especially for zero cost), wasn’t as interesting as the ones in Ottawa and New York City, but it could be because I was expecting to see some modern American fighter and stealth planes, but I guess most of them were elsewhere. Sadly, the astro-cosmo viewing wasn’t open at the hours we visited so we missed out on that, and the planetarium (fee applies) was showing the same evolutionary film narrated by Robert Redford that I had already seen in August at the California Academy of Sciences in San Francisco. The Lego exhibit was also a little smaller than expected, with models that focus on buildings and projects that had architectural character, although famous buildings like the Eiffel Tower were not displayed. We also stopped by the butterfly garden, which had little butterflies, and the Museum of Natural History, but I enjoyed the Harvard Museum of National History, MA instead. We also visited the National Zoo, which while quiet, had some interesting exhibits (like the towers for the orangutans to cross).</p>




<p><a title="IMG_9182 by b.p., on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aimeili/6236402627/"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6173/6236402627_3d5985dd6d.jpg" alt="IMG_9182" width="400" height="266"></a>﻿</p>




<p>We didn’t actually have time to see any of the memorials and we took few pictures of the landmarks (Capitol Hill, Washington Monument), but we came across some pleasant surprises:</p>




<ul><li>God’s protection and His timing: for whatever reason, upon disbarking the bus, we were approached by some driver on the street selling his services, but we were skeptical so we flagged down a cab. However, within a few seconds, we discovered that he didn’t know where to go to get to our destination, so we got out before the meter started ticking. The sketchy driver came back to solicit his driving services; we were reluctant so we headed back to the bus area…when, I realized that I was missing my SLR camera, lenses, my wallet = significance. I initially thought my passport was in there too, but I later realized I had moved it elsewhere. Long story short, we talked to the bus employees and they managed to retrieve it from the bus at the depot and drive it back. Not only that, they told us that the subway was only two blocks away, so we ended up taking the more economical route (saving us probably a good $15). If we had not encountered the strange drivers, I may had not retrieve my belongings at all (since these buses tend to continue their scheduled route). Lesson one: people don’t mind being blunt – I was quite unaccostumed to hearing their constant asking for “reward” money, but they deserved it for their extra effort and safe return of all my belongings.</li>




<li>We had no trouble with our accomodations, my first booking with <a href="http://www.airbnb.com/users/show/1191691" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Airbnb.com</a> – it went smoothly and I felt pretty safe in the building/neighbourhood.</li>




<li>Walked through a garden of some modern art pieces – it was quite interesting to see modern man-made pieces into a natural setting</li>




<li>Mount Vernon, George Washington’s estate contained a little bit more of the American history that I was looking for – it contained the house the Washingtons stayed at, and told about George Washington’s personal life, like his wooden dentures, and how he died (caught a cold/infection) with him knowing he was close to his end (had his wife execute one of two wills).

<a title="IMG_9480 by b.p., on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aimeili/6236425651/"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6212/6236425651_6fa990c7d4.jpg" alt="IMG_9480" width="400" height="266"></a>﻿</li>




<li>And of course, the food…</li>


</ul><p>On to the food! So with D researching the museums, I was tasked with finding other things to do, like places to eat. And eat we did – with D willing to accompany me on our food treks. Our first (and last!) stop was at the Eastern Market/the Hill for some AMAZING crab cakes at Market Lunch. I tend not to like crab cakes because they’re usually a salty, deep-fried wad of processed seafood meat. But you could actually see the pieces of crab in these crab cakes. Actually, we were so impressed at the food and the 1/2 tea 1/2 lemonade, that we ordered an oyster sandwich too. We also couldn’t help but smile at Tommy’s service. D was a great food companion, as we were able to share almost everything, and still be satisfied.</p>




<p><a title="IMG_9163 by b.p., on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aimeili/6236923724/"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6224/6236923724_685d4f8307.jpg" alt="IMG_9163" width="400" height="266"></a>﻿</p>




<p>To finish, we shared a gelato for dessert. While a bit on the pricier side, the selection was more unique, with flavours like a qunince, and rhubarb. I ended up settling for passionfruit, while D had some milk tea gelato (yes, that tasted like real milk tea). Later that day, we tried a self-serve froyo place, where it was no more than 69 cents an ounce, with free hot fudge. I discovered that froyo tastes best with the original tart taste, and that if you quickly pull down and release the lever, you’ll just get mush. And of course, we piled on the hot fudge.</p>




<p><a title="IMG_9310 by b.p., on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aimeili/6236936694/"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6221/6236936694_24da905e8e.jpg" alt="IMG_9310" width="400" height="266"></a></p>




<p>Our host’s neighbour also drew us a map of the neighbourhood and placed some recommendations on it. One was a miss at Chix but I can see the potential draw (they missed giving us the sauce so the chicken was a little dry), but the other was nice happy hour appetizers (and wine) at a local wine bistro (Vinotecca). And here is lesson two: Washington folks dress well. I don’t remember feeling so underdressed in a city before.</p>




<p>With our luck (what luck, when God watches over us?), we stumbled across the city’s food festival, with many vendors along a few blocks selling a sample of their specialty items like fish tacos, (lobster?) mac&cheese with candied bacon, and waffle sandwiches (with a line up that felt like a mile long so we skipped that one). Admission was $15 for 10(?) tickets, enough for us to share our samples with each other.</p>




<p><a title="IMG_9385 by b.p., on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aimeili/6236419857/"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6225/6236419857_458fef368f.jpg" alt="IMG_9385" width="400" height="266"></a></p>




<p>I was also blessed to be able to eat some homemade Malaysian food, and meet some of D’s extended family, and her extended family’s friends. We ended back at the Hill to shop at the street market and in hopes that the Market Lunch was still open. If it wasn’t closed, we would have missed stumbling upon the pizza joint, 7th Hill. We ordered and sat at the bar, watching the pizza creator put the fresh ingredients into the pizza, tossing it in the air, and placing it into the stone oven. The pizza reminded me of the ones we had eaten in Italy, with thin crust, little tomato sauce, and good ingredients.</p>




<p>We ended our trip at Pounds, local coffee shop at the Hill, with D having a nutella latte with latte art, and I with their smooth house blend top secret iced coffee (they sell beans, but not for their iced coffee) – another accidental find!</p>




<p><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Lesson three:</span>Maybe it’s more of an observation than a lesson: based on my time in San Francisco and DC, it seems like people are more open about their sexual orientation in these two cities than all of Canada combined, where it’s openly blessed and practiced.</p>

		<p>				<a title="IMG_0436p by b.p., on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aimeili/6168331220/"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6168/6168331220_deba6cb41f.jpg" alt="IMG_0436p" width="400" height="246"></a></p>




<p>We started our cruise and ended our cruise in Venice, so we had to look for accomodations as a result. Because hotels can get pretty pricey, we settled on some short-term apartment rentals (“bed and breakast” type accomodations, but with the place to ourselves and no hot breakfast).</p>




<p>The accomodations were pretty liveable, but with one major complaint: mosquitoes. I’m not sure if it’s because our rooms were on the ground floor (next to the canals), or because the windows were open before we checked in. If that wasn’t a problem, I think I preferred the second place more: our host at Casa dei Pittori﻿ met us at an easy-to-find spot, recommended some really good eats nearby (Rio Marin for their light pasteries and Alaska for their gelato: the ginger one especially wasn’t too sweet and had real pieces of ginger in it!), and was able via phone to answer any of our questions.</p>




<p> <a title="IMG_1532 by b.p., on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aimeili/6184087886/"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6179/6184087886_6ef486d05c.jpg" alt="IMG_1532" width="400" height="266"></a>﻿</p>




<p>Because we had wandered around in Venice for two days prior to this trip, we ended up hitting all the popular spots on the first day, and then spent one day in Murano, the glass-making island. In fact, we ended up going to Murano after the cruise, and had gone into a shop that was recommended by NCL. However, they had no open tours, but after speaking to a manager, he let us sneak into the hot workshop and watch the glass blower make a few pieces; he was an older man, likely weathered by the heat and ashes from what comes with the job. The glass and their designs in Murano and Venice seem clearer and more intricate than what I see on this side of the world, but it’s sad to hear that the majority of it is a copy from a template brought from Venice to China – and most of us can’t tell the difference.</p>




<p>What not to eat in Venice? I was brave and tried the black-squid ink pasta, but tomato based pasta is the way to go! This is not your typical “Italian” tomato sauce-based pasta with meatballs, but a simple dish with pieces of tomatoes and herbs like basil. Pizza isn’t necessarily a recommended item in Venice, but regardless of where we had it, it was heaps better than the types of pizza here – in fact, the pizza I had in Washington, DC (7 Hill) reminded me of the pizza we had in Venice. There is a warning though: be careful of where you eat in Venice – there are places where you sit on the side of the canal, and it seems relatively cheap? Well, think fast-food, but more like Michelena’s – frozen entrees that they reheat and serve to you.</p>




<p><a title="IMG_1600 by b.p., on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aimeili/6184102288/"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6174/6184102288_c19facdfb8.jpg" alt="IMG_1600" width="400" height="266"></a></p>




<p>What has changed since our last visit? Venice now has a people mover, which is a monorail that moves people from town into the port for 1 euro each way; it saves about 10 minutes dragging your luggage. We asked our host about it, and he mentioned that it was only installed within the last couple of years. Cheaper quality gelato is now also 30 euro cents more than what it was before (1.30 euro vs. 1 euro), and this time, the weather seemed to be hotter than last. Thankfully, it didn’t really rain until the morning of our departure. So what do people do with seven days in Venice? We pretty much had a good taste of it in a couple.</p>

<p>While I enjoyed the scenery of Croatia, j.w certainly enjoyed the most historical spots: Athens, Greece; and Ephesus (Izmir), Turkey. While we both like ruins, I think these places were more special because of the biblical significance of these spots.</p>




<blockquote>While Paul was waiting for them in Athens, he was greatly distressed to see that the city was full of idols. So he reasoned in the synagogue with the Jews and the God-fearing Greeks, as well as in the marketplace day by day with those who happened to be there. A group of Epicurean and Stoic philosophers began to dispute with him. Some of them asked, “What is this babbler trying to say?” Others remarked, “He seems to be advocating foreign gods.” They said this because Paul was preaching the good news about Jesus and the resurrection. Then they took him and brought him to a meeting of the Areopagus, where they said to him, “May we know what this new teaching is that you are presenting? You are bringing some strange ideas to our ears, and we want to know what they mean.” (All the Athenians and the foreigners who lived there spent their time doing nothing but talking about and listening to the latest ideas.) 

 Paul then stood up in the meeting of the Areopagus and said: “Men of Athens! I see that in every way you are very religious. For as I walked around and looked carefully at your objects of worship, I even found an altar with this inscription: TO AN UNKNOWN GOD. Now what you worship as something unknown I am going to proclaim to you. 

 “The God who made the world and everything in it is the Lord of heaven and earth and does not live in temples built by hands. And he is not served by human hands, as if he needed anything, because he himself gives all men life and breath and everything else. From one man he made every nation of men, that they should inhabit the whole earth; and he determined the times set for them and the exact places where they should live. God did this so that men would seek him and perhaps reach out for him and find him, though he is not far from each one of us. ‘For in him we live and move and have our being.’ As some of your own poets have said, ‘We are his offspring.’ – Acts 17:16-28 (NIV 1984)﻿</blockquote>




<p> While I know that Ephesus is home to a church that Paul ministers to, and spends significant time in, I didn’t realize that Areopagus, aka Mars Hill, was THE mound of rock that my brother and j.w ventured up to explore and get a better view of the Parthenon. Had I have known, I probably would’ve joined them and used my imagine to picture what it was like in the day, instead of resting on a bench at the bottom of the hill under some shade to cool off.</p>




<p>And for those who laugh at ARTS students, here’s a bonus for me: upon showing the staff my student ID, she noticed the ARTS label on it and told me it was free for arts students, despite me not being in fine arts, or history. Sweet! (students do get half off, but I guess arts students get an added benefit).</p>

<p>On one of the stops on our Ephesus excursion, we stopped by what is known as “<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_the_Virgin_Mary" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the House of the Virgin Mary</a>“. This site is purportedly﻿ the house that Mary, the mother of Jesus was taken care of by St. John after Jesus’ death. It seemed like any old restored house, with shorter frames for the doorways, and a serene path that leads to it – what was really striking though, was not the house, or holy spring water that came from a faucet, but the wall of wishes. People would write their burdens and prayers on a tissue, or any scrap paper and tie it to the wall, in the hopes that their prayers are answered. One even came from a younger child pleading for her parents to stop fighting, which was quite sad and moving.</p>

		<p>				In September, we went on another Mediterranean cruise, this time beginning and ending in Venice with the company of my parents and my brother.</p>




<p>Because of time restrictions, we chose a 7-day cruise with the Norwegian Jade (NCL). Compared to the Carnival Dream, the Jade was a lot smaller, much simpler, and we had less activities to choose from to pass time while on board/at sea. NCL, however, has better live shows (entertainment) than the Dream and it allows you to have a much more flexible schedule, so you can dine when you want and where you want, with very little restrictions on the dress code.</p>




<p>We got chatting with a few of the crew members on board, and found out that many of them come from less-wealthy countries, leave their families behind and work on board for over 9 months, with long hours each day. One 20 year old young man started telling us about his family and he teared up just thinking that he would see them in 2 months.</p>




<p><a title="IMG_0591 by b.p., on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aimeili/6182834704/"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6151/6182834704_08bf835c74.jpg" alt="IMG_0591" width="400" height="266"></a></p>




<p>Once again, Croatia was one of my favourite ports that we stopped at – both Dubrovnik (above) and Split (below). We had beautiful weather, with blue skies and sunny days, despite it being very hot (hotter than our last trip). NCL also tendered at the port, so we didn’t have to walk half an hour before reaching the old town, which was a great bonus!</p>




<p><a title="IMG_1369 by b.p., on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aimeili/6184005224/"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6172/6184005224_964fffe9a6.jpg" alt="IMG_1369" width="400" height="266"></a></p>




<p>Split is probably known for their abundance of lavender; both cities sell potpurri packets filled with lavender, but it was in Split that we came across plants that were very fragrant – turns out they were fresh lavender plants!</p>




<p><a title="IMG_1428 by b.p., on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aimeili/6184064530/"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6159/6184064530_e74ce8509d_m.jpg" alt="IMG_1428" width="160" height="240" align="right"></a>It was also in Split that we happened upon a rather deserted restaurant called Luna Cafe that looked rather pricey. However, we all tried the local beer and the seafood was probably the freshest that I had in a very long while, and the price was worth it! j.w enjoyed a <strong>kilogram</strong>of mussels (~$15?), which wasn’t fishy at all, and my mother and I split a whole pan-fried fish seasoned with some sea salt ($30).﻿</p>

If I could apply good customer service to a city, I would say San Francisco just earned it – everywhere I went, people were charming and sweet. I stand in line, and the customer in front would make recommendations (Tartine Bakery); I go into a hotel (Palomar) asking for a taxi, and they would chat with you aside from business talk; and even the restaurant staff (Burma Superstar) seemed sincerely apologetic that they couldn’t get you a seat as they spoke to their patrons over the phone!


</p><h3>Inn San Francisco</h3>


The bed and breakfast I stayed at, <a href="http://www.innsf.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Inn San Francisco</a>, was charming! I would classify it more as an inn as you got privacy than most bed and breakfasts (less chatting) and it felt secure. The view on the roof was nice (see fog pictures below), and the feather bed was comfortable, and despite the not-so-glowing reviews of the Mission area, I felt safe, walking outside alone before dusk. In fact, Liza, one of the hosts mentioned that of the 37 years they’ve been there, not one incident had resulted (and I wasn’t about to be the first). Inn San Francisco also offered glasses of complimentary California sherry and port, hot tea, and sweet California fruit like plums, peaches, oranges and apples (does importing it to Ontario really make it less sweet because it’s not as ripe?!). Two square of complimentary ghirardelli chocolate squares greet you in each room – I didn’t even realize the company is from San Francisco! Breakfast was self-serve, but with the amazing assortment of pre-cut fresh fruit (pineapple, watermelon mango, papaya, strawberries), I was happy to eat that and a slice of either corn quiche or spinach quiche. The down side is that breakfast is pretty much the same selection of food everyday, although I did pass on items like cheese and hard-boiled eggs and cereal. Why? The conference I attended at UCSF Mission Bay campus had amazing croissants and pastries (to which their staff couldn’t tell me where it came from), so I made sure to have two breakfasts everyday :).
I admit, one of the reasons why I like to stay at bed and breakfasts because I get to meet people who we wouldn’t otherwise meet, and get a glimpse of their lives. Marty, one of the owners, told me about his son, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Neely" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Anthony Neely</a>, who is a talented pop star in Taiwan! He had won a singing competition, and now he has quite the following – if I was his father, I would be quite proud of him too.

<h3>Tartine Bakery</h3>


Aside from some poorer reviews of the older neighbourhood, it’s in the heart of many, many good eats! The neighbourhood is known for some amazing Mexican food, and on evening 2, I ventured out to Tartine Bakery and made it in to order just as it was closing (less than a 15 min walk, which when you do walk, you will pass by a local graphic novel shop – one that features local artists, like Gene Luen Yang). The seasonal fruit fragpaine tarte (wild blueberry at the time from what I could tell) was amazing – it wasn’t too sweet, and the pastry just flaked off; it took me back to Europe momentarily. The customer in line in front of me told me that I should’ve ordered the coconut tart, but by then it was too late, and I was worried that it was going to be too sweet (though the customer insisted it wasn’t) – guess I must try it again next time! Dessert for dinner? Fine by me 🙂

The week started with really warm and good weather, but it soon became very cold (12C/54F) especially at nights, and when the wind and fog just rolled right over. In fact, the fog was a funny phenomenon because it would be foggy in one area of the city, but sunny and warm in another.

<h3>Off the Grid</h3>


My parents flew down to join me for the weekend (have the best parents!), and it turned out to be an atypical trip, as we bypassed many of the touristy activities, partially because I had done them in a previous trip many years ago. Instead, they happily accompanied me to Off the Grid at Fort Mason Center on Friday night, and we walked! Boy, was that a mistake – the weather seemed to have gotten a lot cooler and winder near the Wharf, and next time, I need to remind myself to bring a sweater. But, 30 food trucks in a parking lot? That was not to be missed. In fact, I first read about it on <a href="http://www.seriouseats.com/2011/09/off-the-grid-san-francisco-mobile-street-food-market-ca-sf.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Serious Eats, and they just featured it again</a>.
<a title="IMG_0191 by b.p., on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aimeili/6101682407/"><img alt="IMG_0191" src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6080/6101682407_7fba62cee6.jpg" width="400" height="266"></a>
Best options? I really liked Seoul on Wheels’ Korean BBQ tacos and Chairman Bao’s pork belly buns. It was nice to be asked if I was Korean, after ordering their galbi bbq taco without kochujang – because that meant my Korean classes sort of helped!


<h3>Ferry Building Marketplace</h3>


<a title="IMG_0255 by b.p., on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aimeili/6102239780/"><img style="float: right;" alt="IMG_0255" src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6073/6102239780_e1f45afdf0_m.jpg" width="160" height="240"></a>On Saturday morning, my parents accompanied me to Ferry Building Marketplace to check out the Saturday market. Yes, I admit, their fresh fruit were pretty steep, but the food was again, really good, especially the porchetta sandwich from Roli Roti. They roast it in the stationary food truck, and the oils from the meat just drip down on the potatoes that are roasting at the same time – and that equates to: YUM!
<a title="IMG_0258 by b.p., on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aimeili/6102242210/"><img alt="IMG_0258" src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6196/6102242210_f9178484b4_m.jpg" width="240" height="160"></a>


<h3>Pier 39</h3>


We took a break from food in the afternoon, and drove to the beaches near Lions Gate Bridge and Alcatrez.  And of course, the bridge was half-covered in fog, and it was windy. We made a stop at Cocoabella for some delightful chocolates, on a good recommendation of a colleague, and also spent some time at Pier 39, watching the silly antics of the sea lions and had a chower and shared a plate of fresh, steamed clams. I liked the clams, as it didn’t have the fishyness that sometimes we have with clams over here, but the broth was rather salty, and my stomach reacted to the chowder.
<a title="IMG_0293 by b.p., on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aimeili/6101702295/"><img alt="IMG_0293" src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6181/6101702295_5a11b38a5a.jpg" width="400" height="266"></a>


<h3>Burma Superstar, Genki</h3>


By the end of UX Week, I had met a couple of other food enthusiasts, one being <span class="user-name"><a class="user-profile-link" title="Deny" href="https://twitter.com/#%21/denykhoung" data-user-id="100338325"><strong>@denykhoung</strong></a></span>, who recommended going into Inner Richmond for some Asian eats. And like most major cities with Chinatowns, many Chinese had actually moved into the suburbs. So, we ventured into Richmond, and my parents – the troopers that they are – waited with me for a seat at Burma Superstar for <strong>2 hours</strong>. For a place that doesn’t take reservations, they do have a pretty neat system in that they will take down your mobile number and then call you when a table is almost ready. Alas, we didn’t have a local number so we waited around and had dessert first at Genki. Two “cuisines” I had in one night that I hadn’t yet tried until then: Burmese and Japanese crepe dessert (green tea, canned lychee fruit with whipped cream in a warm crepe cone).
<a title="IMG_0306 by b.p., on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aimeili/6101704933/"><img alt="IMG_0306" src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6184/6101704933_bef63d7c7a_m.jpg" width="200" height="300"></a> <a title="IMG_0316 by b.p., on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aimeili/6102262858/"><img alt="IMG_0316" src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6184/6102262858_a568f6619c_m.jpg" width="200" height="300"></a>
By the end of the trip, I discovered that many of the brands I like comes from this area: Gene Luen Yang, author of <em>American Born Chinese</em>, Timbuk2 – sturdy messenger bags, AirBnB – an accomodation service that I just heard about this summer, and it’s home to some really good eats.]]>

<li>How? The answer was to understand behaviour and motivation, which was completely what Stephen P. Anderson had stressed in his workshop.</li>

How did these designs get through in such a short period? With support from leaders at the top.</li>




<li>From Rob Maigret within Disney: focus on long-term <strong>relationships </strong>with customers, not short-term returns; put customers first, marketing second: ads are carbs, stories are protein.<br><ul><li>How did it work for them? engaging in a 2-way conversation when possible, and quality content and storytelling is the core of their strategy.</li>




<li><strong>Go to where the people are, instead of having people come to you</strong></li>

Funny, how this theme of being social, local, mobile resonated throughout the day, but it’s not something new, and is being preached at other conferences around town (“social, local, mobile” is the quote I stole from a friend who attended Dreamforce ’11 – also held in SF).

		<p>				Guerilla Research




</p><p>Led by Russ Unger, half of this half-day workshop on Day 2 was “lecture style”, and the other half was field work. I had gone into the workshop expecting to learn lot more “guerilla” methods, but came out realizing that many of the methods I have used or heard of before, including:</p>




<ul><li>Unmoderated testing</li>




<li>A/B testing</li>




<li>Remote testing</li>




<li>User/browser role playing</li>




<li>Mobile testing</li>


</ul><p>I cringed every time the faciliator let out the f-bomb (for emphasis, dramatic effect? I never know why people chose to use it in public presentations and speaking), but no one verbally protested so we all let it slide﻿. The new methods I came across were:</p>




<ul><li>Man on street/coffee shop: testing on the streets</li>




<li>Burrito lunch: food in exchange for testing</li>




<li>Rapid iterative protosketches (RIPS): 3, 2, then 1 design</li>




<li>Empathy maps: personas/game storming</li>




<li>Design the box: take a cereal box and arrange import information into each side – highlights priorities</li>


</ul><p>We practiced the design studio method, putting together an 8-up, which is 6-8 ideas in 5 minutes – focused on quantity not quality. Then, we pitched and critiqued each others designs as pertinent to the (broad) requirements before merging into 1 design, which was improved upon in an iterative cycle when we validated it with others. Validation of the design was where the field work happened, and admittedly, it was a pretty fun and eye-opening exercise – especially after the <a href="http://uxweek.posterous.com/the-dry-run-session">dry-run session</a>. Plus, beer was certainly a nice way to end the session, which also led to a few of us staying behind to chat.</p>

<h3>Mental Models</h3>




<p>Indi Young led this day-long workshop on Day 3, but by the end of the first half, it really had me thinking that I should’ve taken two half-day ones instead, like the “How to Work with a Product Manager” workshop by Kevin Cheng /twitter. Maybe it was because I expected it to be more around what “mental models” were and how to build them. Yes, admittedly, the “lecture” part of the workshop did cover techniques on how to combine and group (into mental spaces). But in the practical hands-on portion of the workshop, I found most of the focus was around interviewing (which yes, I admit is important but that could be a workshop on its own), card-sorting and design.﻿</p>

		<p>				Seductive Interaction Design: Are you using what you know about human behaviours in your design?
The first workshop, led by Stephen P. Anderson, of the book by the same name: <a href="http://www.amazon.ca/Seductive-Interaction-Design-Effective-Experiences/dp/0321725522" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Seductive Interaction Design</em></a>, and  the <a href="http://getmentalnotes.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mental notes</a> pack, was a good complement to Human Factor International’s course PET (Persuasian, Emotion, Trust). I had hesitated to take this workshop at first, despite the interest in the topic, precisely because I thought it would be redudant.
This workshop was popular, as it filled up pretty quickly, even after it re-opened for more attendees, and his book sold out before the end of the conference.
It was a good refresher anyway. I’ve known about the techniques to get consumers to buy from the PET course (such as “5 seats left” on airline sites, although I found out that some companys break that “trust”, because I bought 5 tickets from them, and it showed “5 seats left” for the same price again even after my transaction), but one thing I took away from this workshop, was that we can make otherwise ordinary things (or rather painful but unavoidable things, like walking up the stairs or completing a registration form) into something more delightful to engage in: <strong>making it fun</strong>, or delighting.
Anderson started the workshop (and the book) with a video that was circulated awhile back by <a href="http://thefuntheory.com/">a VW initiative </a>where they took some everyday activities/ideas and tried to make it fun – like throwing out the trash, or using the stairs or the elevator:
<iframe src="http://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2lXh2n0aPyw" frameborder="0" width="400" height="255"></iframe>
In terms of websites, one could be fine in terms of usability, with no obvious problems, but how can it be improved to solve a high bounce rate or low adoption? The answer was around about removing the friction (ie. good usability) PLUS increasing the motivation (psychology; human behaviour) of engagement.
In terms of initial engagement, one needs to stand out from competition.  Which, actually tied in nicely with Todd Walthhall’s comment the day prior that [good] experience design is our competitive advantage.
The business goals (outcome) should align with user goals (what people do), but Anderson stressed that knowing how humans behave or what motivates one, should not be used in manipulation coercion. We need to think about what poeple need to do in order for your business (goal) to be successful. His advice? <em>Start with functionality, then build out the fun.</em>
Sure, one could look to gaming techniques, but instead of motiviating human behaviour through game mechanics (a concept known as gamification), motivate through psychology. The first often focus on extrinsic rewards are often short-lived, but the latter focuses on instrinsic motiviation.
So what motivates human behaviour? He shared some design ideas on how to do this, such as:


</p><ul><li>Recognition with one’s own name, human faces</li>




<li>The desire to complete an incomplete set</li>




<li>Desire for self-expression: customizing, creating own profile, self goals and association with self</li>

I have high expectations of UX Week as I chose to attend particular UX – user experience event/conference (from a selection of many) based on recommendations from people. But, I think I tried to compare it too much to Interactions (an IxD conference), which seems to have more of a practical focus, and also more my area of interest.
So far, UX Week feels more like TED talks for smart UX people, which I am not. Some of the demos, like the ones by 18 year olds blew me away (in a good way) – companies should be hiring these students! At times, it also felt like Adaptive Path case studies or success stories instead of impartial talks. It’s more like going to university than college: you don’t get practical hands-on experience unless you attend the workshops; instead, the talks are rather abstract and somehow you manage to extract principles around the various topics on politics, biology (genetics), business (economics), and mathematics (statistics, algorithms, geometry). And, like school, you see and meet new faces and hope to make friends in your classes/program – some people know each other from before, or are attending together, but others are like me, attending for the first time and the only one representing their company.
Nice touches: moleskin notebooks to jot down interesting notes and pre-washed alumnimum water bottles to make sure you’re hydrated throughout the conference. And, they take you to field trips: to the club and to the California Academy of Sciences Night Life, not to mentioned sponsored lunches (although some food ran out by the time I got to the front of the line), and drinks (alcholic and non-alcoholic).

Some common themes or interesting intepreted comments that seemed to surface from the assortment of speakers today:


<ul><li>The use of video in experience design, whether as demostrative, to educate, or for pleasure


<ul><li>One talk suggested the use of the Kinect and the TV as a digital canvas for painting, but I would argue that it’s not the same as the tactical feel of painting and the texture is very important in art and painting</li>




<li>People arrange their living spaces, especially the living room, around the TV (us? it’s around the piano now, and the TV is secondary) but the TV is still primarily a passive, consumption medium</li>




<li>The integration of social content and media can enhance and deliver a richer experience (like the demo of 1dollair from CCA)</li>


</ul></li>




<li>Advertising is romanticizing ideals (or ideal purpose of product) – Jaron Lanier


<ul><li>Good point. How many times do we see a car commercial that says something along the lines of stunt driver, closed circuit, do not attempt at home? Or the commercials with perfect models and scenic landscapes…</li>


</ul></li>




<li>“Feedback is a gift” – Todd Walthall


<ul><li>His company moved from mail/phone interaction to digital contacts 10:1; and his background in call support, just makes it so much more relevant to what we do</li>




<li>“Experience design is a competitive advantage”</li>




<li>The strengths and opportunities at their company echoed some of ours</li>


</ul></li>




<li>Sometimes, the story behind the story (product) is just as important – Chad Jennings


<ul><li>People like stories, a narrative can often evoke emotions or a connection (to the author in this case) that a product otherwise can’t</li>




<li>Also: limiting choice can often help make decisions smoother – reminded me of the illustration with the supermarket samples where one table had more samples but one had less. The one with more samples had more visits, but ironically enough, the one with less resulted in more purchases. I guess that’s why sometimes restaurants with a larger menu choice seems to be a bit more overwhelming than one with only a few choices (less broad, more specialty)</li>


</ul></li>




<li>More buys/adds doesn’t mean that it is good in the long run (blockbuster mentality or twitter followers)</li>




<li>We’re not always aware of why we do things –  we may rationalize differently when asked – Steven Pemberton


<ul><li>I have seen this in user research. When you observe someone attempt a task, sometimes they are not consciously aware of what they are doing until you ask them about it, and the reason they give you may not necessarily match.</li>


</ul></li>




<li>Connect people with <em>different</em> skills and perspectives: not 1D-thinking. By avoiding illectual uniformity, which kills critical thinking, you foster complementary collaborators and richer ideas. You may not even like them, but that’s even better – Chris van der Halt and PJ Onori</li>




<li>“Subtlety is the key to everything…if it feels right, tone it down a notch” – Adam Lisagor</li>




<li>If a new user hits a barrier and doesn’t engage within 7 days after first use (excluding login sign up), they likely won’t come back – Mark Trammell for Twitter


<ul><li>Why? Some did not understand or see the value or the experience/product did not map to their expectations</li>




<li>Why do some re-engage? The perception of value evolved the more they used it: what brought them here may not have been the same as what kept them here.</li>




<li>One thing they did was to add a step in their sign-up flow preparing for a drop in completion but to allow more connections, but instead an increase in complete resulted, and more people were engaged (29%!)</li>




<li>Sometimes, tweaking the text can change the semantics and increase the perceived value</li>




<li>1 problem may actually be a subset of problems</li>




<li>These insights can definitely apply in my work as we also have those that sign-up but never return</li>


</ul></li>




<li>Sometimes accidents result in new experiences (e.g. Edison’s turn table: dictation machine, not for DJs) – DJ Spooky/Paul Miller</li>




<li>Lastly, Airbnb and Quora must be a San Francisco-based company (or nearby), because I have heard it mentioned more than once! (And to think that I’ve only heard of Airbnb within the last 3 months)</li>


</ul>


And that’s it for Day One!]]>
