		<p>				cue: panic
Funny how the second-baby syndrome has already begun, even with pregnancy:


</p><ul><li>haven’t taken many belly shots, despite knowing that my belly is bigger (and seems to sit lower) this time around</li>


    

<li>we haven’t decorated any rooms for this baby</li>


    

<li>the husband has shown up to only 1 or 2 midwife appointments so far, as opposed to the majority of them for Bean</li>


    

<li>I don’t know which week I am at unless I’m at my midwife appointment – I only know that there’s less than one month left</li>


    

<li>no shower or party planned for baby at the moment</li>


    

<li>I haven’t been as diligent in terms of diet in avoiding foods like cured meat (especially bacon) and soft cheese (but still do avoid raw fish)</li>


</ul>


So I guess with only a month left, here’s <a href="http://goo.gl/forms/ZP1ovFBKC2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a poll for you: guess the baby’s gender, birthday, and time</a>!
<iframe width="760" height="1050" src="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1O-Y-NkVvBPY1zak_nNA3TUN_91YswI4bG177AVsJF20/viewform?embedded=true" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0">Loading…</iframe>
While I don’t know the gender, here are some hints/observations – some of which are repeated <a href="http://her.happyhippos.ca/2013/07/boy-or-girl/">in an older post</a> (so I don’t <a href="http://her.happyhippos.ca/2013/07/its-a-baby/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">win again this time around</a>):


<ul><li>My midwife says that boys have a tendency to come earlier than girls (more likely to have premature babies)</li>


    

<li>One of my midwives has told me that the majority of the babies she has delivered had a tendency to be born at night</li>


    

<li>While I originally wanted another hospital birth, I plan to start with a home birth this time around – just to prove that it’s perfectly fine to do so (contrary to family’s belief and comments, similar to their comments about midwives – vs OBs and other healthcare professionals)</li>


    

<li>This baby hiccups daily – at least 2-3 times a day, most often in the evenings</li>


    

<li>I can feel body parts jabbing at me daily – and can almost feel limbs like the heel, knee, and sometimes if I press enough, I feel like maybe the rib-like feeling are the toes</li>


    

<li>Sadly, I have given in to my body pain (right side pelvic / pubic bone pain) and have withdrawn from badminton (which incidentally ended 1 month earlier last time around) so I don’t aggravate it further</li>


    

<li>My belly seems to be lower and larger than when I was carrying Bean</li>


    

<li>All babies have historically arrived early from the mothers on my side of the family (mother, sister, aunts, cousins). My mom’s generation of babies (ie. my cousins) on average came 20 days early; my generation of babies came 12 days early (ie. my cousin’s/sister’s babies); Bean came 8 days early.</li>


    

<li>My original calculated date, before a medical review, was December 5, 2015, but ultrasounds and healthcare professionals now say the estimated due date is December 7, 2015</li>


    

<li>Bean has been praying for a <em>mui mui</em> (girl) almost daily</li>

		<p>				adults have ideas on what #kwawesome offers, here’s a list of no or low-cost drop-in programs that are toddler friendly. While the local libraries, Early Years Centres, and some community centres / associations have great programs for children and caregivers, most of them require registration. I didn’t take Bean to many programs when she was younger because they were all offered in the morning, which conflicted with her morning nap; now that she’s just napping in the afternoon, these times work better for us. Drop-in programs are also great for us because it allows flexibility: on low-key days,  or the times we don’t have the car or the weather isn’t bussing or walking friendly, we can choose to stay in.
This list is really to help me keep a track of what’s being offered during the fall and winter terms around us (the start of summer usually means the end of some programs):

		<p>				A few nights ago, a friend asked me what there was to do in Kitchener-Waterloo, and how I found out about them. This isn’t the first time someone has asked for ideas, so I figured a compiled list of what I follow may be helpful to my other self and for future reference – and even though I don’t necessarily have time do venture out to many events offered around time, I still try sometimes! So what piques my interest? Generally, I like to know about free/low-cost activities that don’t need too much commitment.</p></div>




<div> </div>




<div>Here are some of my sources:</div>




<ul><li>Meetup groups – a few that I subscribe to, include:


<ul><li>Badminton Fun in KW – John sends out a reminder of places that offer drop-in badminton around town (mostly at community centres)</li>


    

<li><a href="http://www.meetup.com/Tri-Cities-Food-Lovers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tri-Cities Food Lovers –</a> I tend to follow this group for restaurant ideas (haven’t been to a meetup yet)</li>


    

<li><a href="http://www.meetup.com/Its-On-Events-for-20s-30s-at-Kitchener-Public-Library/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">It’s On – Events for 20s and 30s</a> – a central place for all the events that Kitchener Public Library offers for a specific crowd, though open to all. Note that registration actually happens on the KPL site itself, and that most of it is just a repeat of what’s listed on the KPL Events Calendar (but easier to find here).</li>


    

<li><a href="http://www.meetup.com/Hiking-for-Beginners-in-Cambridge-ON/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hiking for Beginners</a> – while the group says Cambridge, Ontario, I find that a bunch of the hikes are actually in the Kitchener area. I tend to follow them to discover trails around me as the timing for the meetups hasn’t been right for me yet.</li>


    

<li>I also follow the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/KW-Chinese-English-Language-and-Cultural-Exchange/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chinese-English Social Cultural Exchange</a> meetup group to keep a tabs on Chinese eating places around town</li>


</ul></li>


    

<li>Public Library events


<ul><li>I tend to find out about interesting events from the library posters, TV screens, and their <a href="http://www.libraryaware.com/1111/Subscribers/Subscribe?showonlynewsletterlists=true">newsletters</a>; e.g. Etc., Music Notes, KPL News. Popular events that have limited seats tend to fill quickly, and if you end up registering late, you’ll be added to a waitlist. A few that I’ve attended include one on <a href="http://her.happyhippos.ca/2015/05/coffee-notes/">coffee</a>, making your own terrarium during #diyfestival,  interior design, and an upcoming ones that seem interesting is an art class, an escape room adventure featured for international games day, and a <a href="http://kplca.evanced.info/signup/EventDetails.aspx?EventId=11432&lib=" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DIY string art piece</a>.</li>


    

<li>You can also <a href="http://kplca.evanced.info/signup/EventCalendar.aspx">filter events in the calendar</a> to browse for ones that interest you (hint: set filters by Date: today’s date, leave end date open; Event type: Adult, Arts & Culture, Business; Age Group: Adults – List view). Notably, KPL Central branch offers a weekly free movie screening in their theatre space.</li>


</ul></li>


    

<li>Community Centres / Community Associations tend to offer many classes at a reasonable cost, but they usually require registration and a 8-10 weeks of commitment. I find that I have to browse through the leisure guides physically because the online versions aren’t very browseable (ref. <a href="http://issuu.com/cityofwaterloo/docs/waterloo_fall2015_web?e=1669671/14829852" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Waterloo</a> / Kitchener). I’ve noticed that similar classes tend to vary in price depending on where it’s offered, perhaps because of each community centre’s surrounding demographics (e.g. Downtown Kitchener seems to have lower drop-in prices than say RIM Park in Waterloo)


<ul><li>Cooking classes</li>


    

<li>Art classes (e.g. $5 a class for drawing)</li>


    

<li>Language classes (e.g. ASL – $5+ /class, Spanish, Conversational Chinese – $5 a class on Saturday mornings)</li>


    

<li>Social Dance / Ballroom dancing classes, even more affordable than the ones taught at University of Waterloo (outside of the clubs)</li>


    

<li>Drop-in sport activities – organized and self-organized, such as badminton (from $3 a session)</li>


</ul></li>

		<p>				family car sits in our garage. And as it turns out, life doesn’t always go as planned: I was supposed to drive my first car into the ground before buying another; <del>my</del> our next car was to be a used one, not new; <em>and</em>, no way was I going to buy a minivan (even though he wanted one) – I would choose a SUV, even a pick-up truck over a minivan if we had to go up in size (but not a crossover, because I don’t understand the point of those). But my reluctance eventually became a compromise: this one is smaller than a typical minivan and we found a friend willing to buy our old car, one that has served us well for the past 10 years. j.w is happy because he gets to drive a new car, which he has always wanted but never had before <em>and </em>he gets a <del>minivan</del> mini-minivan / microvan – in red too!
And so, we’ve joined the Mazda family.


</p><h3>Pros and Cons</h3>


There aren’t many vehicles to choose from that meets <del>our</del> my requirements if we were going to upgrade: Asian make (American cars are infamous for breaking down sooner and European cars tend to be more expensive to maintain), more than 5 seats, spacious, drives okay, smallish, easy for children to get in and out – or to carry in and out. The nice-to-have sliding doors really limited our choices down to one car that wasn’t as big as a minivan: the Mazda5 – but we were okay to forego that had we found something better. In terms of form factor, it’s not the most stylish vehicle around but contrary to popular opinion, we actually prefer this generation’s look over its earlier counterpart as I didn’t like the vertical lights which gives the perception that car is taller and spacey.  The price of the vehicle seems more affordable than those than fit 6+ passengers in other classes (crossovers, SUVs, minivans, pickup trucks) but comparable in price point to the Kia Rondo; I was just surprised that the base price of this vehicle was about the same price of my ’05 Civic SI sedan – either prices of cars haven’t gone up much in 10 years, or Honda vehicles are valued so much higher than Mazdas (which would make sense as well)! Compared to my mother in-law’s van (Sienna), it feels more agile and zippy, which I like because it feels more like I’m driving a regular car still.
The downsides? Fuel economy rating isn’t the greatest for a vehicle this size as other bigger cars outperform it and it seems to be on its way out: Mazda discontinued the manual transmission (not that we drive it), US has already phased it out, and 2016 and 2015 models are exactly the same (minute differences in curb weight and fuel economy, and a $500 difference in price), and as an everyday vehicle, practically, it’s only a 4-seater; the other two seats take up cargo space and isn’t the most ideal for long(er) legs (ie. adults). I was a little surprised to find that it seems like more of a no-frills vehicle, with little compartments to store items in – especially up front – compared to my old Civic, and even to the Rondo.  I just hope that the Mazda reputation for rust will not follow vehicles in this generation; the sales person tried to assure me that quality has gotten better since its Ford partnership and the fact that it is manufactured in Japan.


<h3>The Test Drive (and Purchase) Experiences</h3>




<h4>Mazda</h4>


When I initially agreed to test drive this car, I was somewhat hoping that I wouldn’t like it as I had my reservations about Mazda; that it would feel too big or bulky and their service would be like <a href="http://her.happyhippos.ca/2005/06/car-shopping/">my first test drive experience with a Mazda3 (at a different dealership)</a>, but surprisingly, that wasn’t the case.  A couple of months had passed, and I didn’t know whether there was any progress with either dealership discussions or on the sale of our car and to me, it seemed that time was running out because year-end stock tends to dwindle by the fall (in favour of clearance prices and next year’s models) and I had thought it was almost time for our friends’ to become new parents (and by extension, life momentarily stands still). I was indifferent about whether to upgrade our car or not – it was more so an opportunity than a need. I didn’t feel like we were very aggressive in terms of negotiation, but some searching on the internet and unhaggle.com gave us a ballpark on what to expect in terms of invoice price and the lowest prices (one site rated room for negotiation as 27% or marginal) and we ended up negotiating by asking for accessories – which we could’ve gotten as a cash discount, but we opted to keep the accessories that were on our wish list anyway. It’s a good thing that j.w asked about tinted windows, because she ended up throwing that in too. By the end of the day, we heard that they are supposed to make at least a $400 profit on a vehicle and at least 10% profit margin on accessories – whether that is true or not is what we don’t know. We also appreciated that they offered a courtesy trade-in service, so that we could save on being taxed full price on our vehicle (and the buyer will have to pay tax anyway). This experience was a much more pleasant one – the salesperson seemed knowledgeable and patient enough, to the point of offering stickers and crayons for the toddler, and offering to read the manual from cover to cover out loud for us (though she says no one has taken up her offer yet). They even provided a CarProof report on our old vehicle (based on the VIN) for our friend to review! Though, I am still surprised that it showed that my car was in a police-reported accident in <em>Ottawa?</em>! I was the only owner and driver of my car at the time of the report (August 2006), and a search through Gmail suggests that I was in KW the weekend it allegedly happened because I offered a friend a ride to a farewell party. If the left front of my car was damaged in an accident and the police was involved, wouldn’t I remember?


<h4>Kia</h4>


From the time of our first test drive to our purchase date, my sister and brother-in-law decided to sell their Fit (also to someone they knew) and buy up. They were originally looking for a used vehicle, but the dealership’s offer for a new Kia Rondo ended up being very near their asking price, plus extra accessories and service perks to boot! (like lifetime car washes and oil changes). They raved so much about their new car that we decided to test drive one, since this generation’s Rondo is different from the 2011 one that I test drove years ago. Maybe we gave off a different vibe, but it seemed like the Kia salesperson wasn’t really interested in negotiating or trying to accommodate us either. I was especially surprised that they gave us a 5-seater Rondo to test drive and when we asked for  a 7-seater, they just told us that the third row is practically useless and wouldn’t fit any adults. They did try to up sell us a Sorrento, which seats 8, but I felt so claustrophobic in the back – as if there was no room to escape / harder to get in and out with the high second-row seats. I was also surprised the sales person sat in the vehicle on our test drive, which makes me feel that I can’t discuss things with my husband as freely. I was surprised that I didn’t like the 2015 as much as the 2011 one – despite it looking more stylish. As a short person, I found my feet hung off the ground on the passenger seat (and you can’t adjust the vertical height) and the dashboard seemed really deep with really thick/chunky A pillars, so despite heated seats and other nice defaults, it wasn’t a favourite of mine.
So while we could’ve test drove other cars, we didn’t.


<h4>Delivery Day</h4>


My husband and I tend to share some similarities but usually he is happy to just go with the flow; I am the opposite. As a planner, I like to be control or at least aware of what’s going on, and being punctual (even though I find myself late too often). During most of this process, I felt that my hands were tied and that I was constantly asking j.w about updates or the status of where we were at in our conversations with either the dealerships or the buyer because I was minimally involved (except I was the one responsible for the paperwork and pickup) – <em>is that how a project manager feels? (if yes, then I’m even more thankful that <a href="http://her.happyhippos.ca/2007/12/mysteries-of-project-management/">I didn’t end up on that path</a>).</em>  At times, I felt like we were playing broken telephone: I would pass on a message but then it either was ignored or misinterpreted, or that I was told one thing but changes happened last-minute whether it was the salesperson telling me she didn’t need to see the car in-person, but expected to last-minute (because of an incident that happened during the week that required a change in policy), or j.w sending me to get the car safety-ed and e-tested an hour before I was supposed to complete the buy-and-sell transaction, waiting for the shop to complete the work, figuring out the logistics in terms of payment, pickup and drop off points, and then rushing from an unfamiliar location in Cambridge back to the dealership, which basically meant I had negative buffer available to use to get to the appointments on time. Additionally, had I known that our friend was going to get the winters mounted, I would’ve probably asked j.w to change it first to save them money. You know I’m stressed when I begin to compare this to wedding planning…
At least I learned a few new things while waiting at the mechanic our friend uses: a) high mount lights are the brake lights at the top of your car – I didn’t even know they weren’t functioning and wonder how long they have been out for (and grateful yet curious why no police officer pulled me over for that); b) they are also used by Forward church (for their vans) – a big church in Cambridge; and, c) at the end of the appointment, someone seemed to recognize me – I think maybe from a dinner party at a friends’ place in Cambridge a few nights earlier.
So, it’s goodbye Honda, hello Mazda. I pray that we can bless others with this car too – just maybe not driving people to and from hockey (which my car was used for a lot during the first few years). We’ll see where the next 10 years takes us…!]]>

		<p>				Our stay-cation


Niagara area


</p><ul><li><strong>Cousin’s wedding at Creekside Estate Winery</strong>: a lovely intimate evening outdoor wedding, with traditions brought in from the bride and groom’s culture – Metis and Chinese (including a tying ceremony and mooncakes). However, I couldn’t bring myself to try the cheese and crackers that many of the fruit flies feasted on – they can’t be avoided at this time of the year because of the grapes they say); we managed to catch the super moon / lunar eclipse!</li>


    

<li><strong><a href="http://outletcollectionatniagara.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Outlet Collection at Niagara</a></strong> – I found it to be more spacious with better food selection / food courts than Premium Outlets – though we managed to squeeze in a 30-minute power shopping stop at those outlets too in Milton on the way to the airport</li>


    

<li><strong>August 8</strong>: The Golden Lotus buffet at Fallsview charges a ridiculous $16 for a 2-year old (same until 10 years old) even though the adults are $20. <em>How many two year olds can eat the same amount as a ten-year old, or 4/5ths of an adult? </em>I enjoyed the variety and quality of the kitchen (cooked) options. They charge a more reasonable $1.20 per year of the child (free under 2). As it turns out mind you, August 8 pricing is actually more per person than Fallsview (because Lotus includes tax and it’s lower per adult), so had we gone, Golden Lotus would’ve saved us at least $16 in the end despite the $16 meal for the 2-year old. Ah well, at least we can say we tried August 8 now. </li>


</ul><div>In town</div>




<ul><li><strong>Early Years Centre:</strong> Music & Movement scheduled program meant that they participated in some songs and parachute fun. It was C’s first time, but she wasn’t shy about it the second time we went; they also had the opportunity to play on the Little Tikes plastic playground items in the open gym and little odds and ends in the Orange Room</li>


    

<li><strong>Pioneer Park Library: </strong>C was around for our first toy-borrowing experience so she got to play with some new toys with Bean. Bean is now super excited when she sees a new toy from the library.</li>


    

<li><strong>St. Jacob’s and Anna Mae’s</strong> (Millbank): We also checked out the newly rebuilt St. Jacob’s market on a Thursday, and even though it was a weekday, it was bustling with people and it seemed a lot bigger in general: with vendors outside and inside of three separate buildings! At one booth, the woman remembered me from the Etsy show two weeks ago, and I found out that she sells her Calendula balm was actually $2 cheaper at the market – and it seemed to be an already reasonable price at the show! ($10 tax in at the market). We managed to catch a filling lunch at Anna Mae’s, a place my parents actually stumbled upon years back, famous for their broasted chicken and pies.</li>


    

<li><strong>The Museum: </strong>It was pretty much deserted at the Museum, which allowed ample time and space for them to play and explore. The two probably spent the most time in the infant and toddler area and the boat water station (just playing with the water, not exactly directing the boats downstream). Sadly, the top floor is now more geared for adults as opposed to children – gone is the sticker and balloon rooms and the science and nutrition stations. Bean enjoyed watching her grandfather flap his arms to a dinosaur game and playing in the color-changing sand pit; she also loved the star show (where we blasted off to many planets, including Jupiter, resulting in her new favourite planet and her frequent reminder asking me, “Do you remember we went to Jupiter?”) but C was “all done” had to leave shortly after it begun (fear of the dark?).</li>


    

<li><strong>Waterloo Park (Zoo): </strong>Bean was a lot more hesitant about the animals roaming around behind the fences at Waterloo Park, but C seemed to enjoy them, especially the llamas, since she knows a song about them. It seems like many of the animals seems to have disappeared, leaving behind overgrown and/or empty habitats including the bunnies and pigs. </li>


    

<li><strong>Shantz Family Farm: </strong>This farm is just five minutes down the road from us – I don’t know why we haven’t gone to it before as everything, including the corn maze is free. The two girls loved the plastic play toys (Little Tikes houses and slides)  in the children’s straw maze area and Bean had a great time with accessible banana seat swings (as opposed to the diaper seats). When we visited on a weekday, it looked abandoned but this past Thanksgiving Monday, it was bustling with families – what a contrast! Bean was afraid of the animals during her first visit, but seemed to warm up to them to the point of wanting to watch and “feed” them on Thanksgiving Monday.</li>


    

<li><strong>Kitchener Market </strong>for Saturday produce and bacon shopping, iced pineapple tea and breadbaron, with a side visit to the Asian supermarket down the street. The children’s program was a bit too advanced for the two kids but they tried to glue a fall wreath together anyway.</li>


    

<li><strong>Oktoberfest: </strong>Because their visit coincided with the beginning of Oktoberfest, we took a trip downtown to check out the street vendors and happened to wander into Hockeytown instead. I thought it was a bit strange that Oktoberfest was so hockey-fied and thought maybe they were sponsors until I later learned that they were two different events in the same area. I think we enjoyed hockeytown more as they had more kid-friendly activities and freebies (including a free jersey for children under 16!).</li>


    

<li><strong>Stratford – The Sound of Music: </strong>The grandparents and j.w lovingly stayed at home to babysit while the sisters had a date to see the Sound of Music in Stratford (40 min leisurely drive – it seems like a lot shorter drive than 40 minutes on the 401 towards Toronto for some reason), thanks to a Groupon-advertised $40 deal. We sat a row apart, next to the sound booth, but the view was great and the sound booth wasn’t much of a distraction – other than me noticing that the guy had the script and music score of the entire play in a binder and would be following along (though at times, he had to catch up a few pages); I do wonder if the AV guy has memorized most of it by now or is bored from seeing it over and over. My short review as posted on Facebook:


<blockquote>Wasn’t sure it was worth seeing the Sound of Music twice, but it was different enough and surprisingly, I enjoyed Stratford’s version more than Toronto’s – the key characters were believable, and I welcomed the comic relief (Max and the “cowboys” as referenced in the review – one vignette coincided well with Oktoberfest). If you have time before the season ends, go catch it!

When dining out, we celebrated my sister’s birthday at Dels and treated my mom to the westernized version of pig ears (fried and savoury sweet) at Fork and Cork Grill. We also managed two lunch visits to Mikey’s and shared some deep-fried tofu (they previously liked) and introduced them to their version of iced lemon tea, beef brisket noodle soup and condensed milk HK style french toast! j.w also took everyone to SOS BBQ for his favourite in town fish and chips, Downtown Crepe Cafe for cappuccino and crepes, Seven Shores for cappuccino and café mocha (my fave place for the latter), and to breadbaron for our family favourite sandwich place (ms piggy! though porksgiving is another fav of mine too when they don’t offer ms piggy). In Mississauga, we tried to visit the recommended Grand Chinese Cuisine, but it was closed to a private wedding reception (though my mother thinks that was a good thing as we found out later that a noodle dish is regularly $18!) so we ended up at Royal Jasmine (very salty but that’s all I know near the 401) and Phoenix (not to be confused with the chain in GTA), a HK style café which had great baked pork chop on fried rice and other good ha-ng-cha dishes overall!
If you’re a friend on Facebook, we’ve posted a <del>few</del> number of photos of them together.


<h3>Developmental progress</h3>




<div>Bean has picked up a few sayings and mannerisms from her cousin (and vice versa) and now sings a version of Veggie Tales’ “where is my hairbrush” and Sesame Street’s “brush your teeth” song and says “nope” and “yep” in addition to her usual “no” and “yeah”; the strangest one yet seems to be her regression in being toilet trained for #2. She used to tell us when she needed to go but a few days into their visit, she actually went in her diaper (and didn’t tell me and even when I asked, she didn’t seem bothered), and even now, she ends up with a funny look (with her poking or picking her nose?!) while on occasion with some crying. When she does acknowledge that she needs to go, and I ask her about it, she tells me she needs to pee too (which she does…which I guess that’s progress to a degree!)</div>

		<p>				First class


I haven’t really drawn or taken up any drawing classes since Art 10 (high school), so I was slightly intimidated when at the first class, I see other adults already bringing out their supplies (watercolor and pencils, though watercolor isn’t something the instructor will focus on – she does have a set for Chinese painting, where you have to grind the blocks to get the color you want) – weren’t supplies going to be included? Clearly, these adults all have some drawing experience. Then again, even in high school, I found art class to be slightly intimidating but always humbling because:


</p><ul><li>a) I don’t have confidence in my work #ownworstcritic</li>


    

<li>b) I compare my artwork with other students around me, and to me, other people’s work often look better</li>


    

<li>c) the teacher, when trying to give you tips or critiquing your work, does it in front of the class or within hearing distance of other students</li>


</ul>


To start of the class, the instructor asked us to drawing anything we wanted. I didn’t particularly enjoy that exercise as I had no idea where to begin on this blank sheet of paper; I tend to have a harder time pulling ideas out of thin air without any direction or inspiration. People around me were already busily drawing realistically-based flowers, faces, hands, birds, and after rejecting my first instinct to draw something cartoony (a house, plane, car, dog – that’s what I’m used to drawing for a two-year old), I ended up drawing a turtle based off of a blob on the table that reminded me of a turtle. Thankfully, the rest of the evening was an exercise in copying what she was inspired to draw based on what the class had drawn, and in the process, she explained how and why to draw a particular detail.
By the end of the first class, she already mentioned some artists in passing, most of which I didn’t recognize (don’t have art history but did recognize a classic name or two), in addition to some art theory, including:


<ul><li>never smudge – not with your fingers or smudging aids, as you’re smudging your own lines, your identity in your work away</li>


    

<li>some artists didn’t believe in “mistakes” (the art of not erasing)</li>


    

<li> “masses” which she sort of explained as a component that makes up the sum of its parts, like the head of a body</li>


    

<li>on shading: “Shading is organised scribbling” (but not in a way that tree leaves look like alligator teeth)</li>


    

<li>repetition is necessary – lines end up blending to resemble something recognizable</li>


</ul>


It was my first time (from what I remember) using a graphite stick and I found that I preferred using it over 8B charcoal pencil because it is more forgiving, and it hides more mistakes. And maybe that explains my fear of using pen as a medium – I feel like I’m committing each stroke of my pen and can’t go back (and thus my fear of commitment resurfaces in art).

When I got home, I wondered out loud if someone brand new to drawing would have been able to follow along. The instructor did comment that she felt our class had a strong foundation (it appears many have had some formal art training, like in watercolors, so they understand ideas such as composition, proportions, flow, light and dark), but j.w did say that it’s unlikely that someone who had no interest in drawing would have signed up, so each student must have had some experience drawing before – whether self-taught or otherwise. I am curious how my art will progress throughout the next 10 weeks; I will have to go back and compare it from the beginning once the class ends.]]>

In our news, we often catch Bean singing or counting to herself nowadays, with skipped lyrics, numbers, or letters, which makes it all the more amusing to listen to – especially when she sees multiples of one item, she just arbitrarily starts to count and assigns a number to it (e.g. 3 birds would be 1, 2, 3, 4 or 1, 2,3, 4, 5, 6 ducks).
PS. Third trimester means that I can start eating more watermelon (don’t ask, because I don’t know why only 3rd trimester is okay but others aren’t per Chinese mom – likely related to it being a “cool” fruit)! Oh yeah, and it’s time to start on the raspberry leaf tea.]]>		</p>

		<p>				and husband) for the first time and while I had moments where another friend’s almost 2-year old daughter reminded me of Bean, the experience felt strangely quite liberating, especially at the wedding reception in the evening as I didn’t have to keep watching the clock, my phone for child-related messages (in fact, I had forgotten it at home!), or for a good opportunity to leave early because it was her bedtime; it was also nice to be able to spend the afternoon with a few friends associated with my time in Ottawa without worrying that j.w would be bored, some of which I hadn’t seen or talked to in many years, many of whom are now married and have children of their own, and all but one have settled elsewhere.
When my friend, the father of the almost 2-yo asked me what Bean was like, I had a moment’s pause: what do I say? I’m not sure whether her antics are typical of toddlers, or unique to Bean’s personality, like her preference to mommy first or her nature to do things a specific way or expectations of them to be done in a certain order and will often get frustrated when she wants to do it herself but doesn’t know how yet. I would probably have a better answer to that question if I poll people who interact with her (@readers: feel free to comment on this!). Now after some reflection, I could say that she seems to observe first, followed by narrating everything she sees or asking what other people are doing, but while she prefers the company of others, especially during play, when she’s around a group of people or new faces, she doesn’t tend to say as much; she is more of a follower than a leader – initially cautious or unsure, watching what others do before she tries it and oft seeks approval by looking my way to gauge my reaction – but that is also perhaps why she enjoys the company of older boys too (they seem to have an air of confidence) and tends to pick up certain things very quickly; and when testing boundaries, she sometimes also has this calculating look before she decides whether to do what you just told her not to do.  (Lately though, we’ve noticed her starting to stutter at the beginning of some sentences even though her ideas are quite formed, but my mother says my brother did that and grew out of it too so it’s not necessarily a cause to worry yet)]]>		</p>

		<p>				<em>Warning: long post ahead</em>
When my sister invited us on a coastal California drive with them, and then told me that her husband was willing to forgo the convertible to rent a minivan and even offered to drive the entire way (j.w didn’t want to drive while on vacation and I don’t like driving vans), we took them up on the offer! We’ve been back for over a month now, and it’s taken way to long to filter through everyone’s photos, but they serve as great visual reminders of our vacation. Bean has come back with a souvenir: tan lines from the California sun. Despite not having very many beach destinations or beach days, she managed to get the sandal tan line! ($10 parking at state beaches wasn’t uncommon, so we didn’t stop at too many as we weren’t going to spend very long there)


</p><h3>California</h3>


I had mixed feelings about California. I especially enjoyed sitting up front, peering out the windshield as we drove along the coast, and parts of it reminded me of Hawaii or even parts of the Rockies / Cabot Trail, NS, but it just happened that it was cloudy or cooler on many days we were outside – especially after leaving San Diego. The temperature hovered at or around 20C / 68F, which made me want to stay inside the vehicle even more (call me acclimatized to our weather, but my ideal comfort is 22-24C).

What struck me was the contrast as we drove through the different parts so that if you blinked, you might miss small details, like not seeing cacti as regular occurrences on the side of the road anymore as you drove further north or seeing the vast differences between neighbouring places (i.e. Laguna Beach: Spanish-style architecture; Newport Beach: modern and wealthy as reflected by Mclaren, Maserati, and Ferrari dealerships within a short distance of each other;  Huntington Beach: industrial). The stark contrast between the idyllic coastal towns and the city were immediately felt once we hit traffic in the Bay area, which made me a bit sad as it indicated our vacation was soon coming to a close, and even though I wasn’t driving, it still triggered a feeling of stress in me.
True to my memory, Californian fruit is much more fragrant than US fruit we buy at our grocery stores. While we didn’t get to enjoy avocados much (due to the ongoing drought), we had plenty of strawberries, cherries, and nectarine / peach, as well as tree-ripened oranges and lemon near Santa Barbara.

<h3><script src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" async="" charset="utf-8"></script>Itinerary</h3>


Travelling with six in one vehicle – two families, two toddlers, one pregnant mom – is  an adventure in itself and requires flexibility, creativity, and adaptability. I basically set little to no expectations in terms of meeting timelines or destination wishes and that actually worked out very well. The highlights that we did see I was really happy about, but some unplanned stops also turned out to pleasant surprises. I was initially a bit disappointed that we didn’t visit many of the food places on my list, but after eating out for at least two times a day, every day, eating out was just another meal – it was a strange feeling. Looking back, a Thai-style curry dinner, a bowl of ramen, and a Chinese-banquet style feast ended up being memorable along with two other meals, so maybe it’s the Asian in me missing Asian food (just visually looking at poke made me want a bowl!). McDonald’s has 20 nuggets for $5 though and jalapeño beef or chicken burgers for just $2! Here’s a summary of where we ended up:


<ol><li><strong>LAX:</strong> <em>Roscoe’s House of Waffles</em>. I read about this place, and I ended up being a bit disappointed as I’ve had better chicken and waffles. The plate of $9 gizzards though…it was seasoned similarly to yeem-sow-gai / karaage and was so big that it took us 3 days to finish it!</li>


</ol>


 


<ul><li><strong>San Diego</strong>: Costco, Target, <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-broken-yolk-caf%C3%A9-san-diego-6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Broken Yolk Cafe,</a> <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/swamis-cafe-san-diego" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong><em>Swami Cafe</em> </strong></a>(for a delicious brunch – I enjoyed strawberry stuffed french toast and dragon fruit/pitaya pancakes), and the <em>San Diego Safari Zoo</em>. I was impressed at the size of the grounds as most zoos I’ve been often seem like they don’t give much as space to their animals. <em>Coronado – Imperial Beach </em>had a short pier board walk and a little play area for kids and the Mexican chip java mocha ice cream at <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/cow-a-bunga-imperial-beach" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong><em>Cowabunga</em></strong></a> microcreamery was worth it! We missed Old-Town though even though it was on our original itinerary. Because we were at a rental townhouse, almost everyone also had a good portion of ahi tuna from Costco seared on the BBQ. Speaking of which, <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/phils-bbq-san-diego-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Phil’s BBQ</a> wasn’t the hype that I expected, but maybe because we have really good southern BBQ spots home in #kwawesome or maybe because it was just too much meat!

</ul>


 
 


<ul><li> On our way to Hope Ranch (near Santa Barbara) for the night, we needed dinner and stumbled across an unassuming fish and chips place in a random plaza. I didn’t exactly want greasy fish and chips as I wasn’t too hungry, but their fish tacos and clam chowder was surprisingly memorable (chunky clams, good soup to filling ratio!)  – who knew a $3.25 fish taco order would actually be enough for two small tacos and tasted so much better than any fish taco I’ve had so far for the value?</li>


</ul>


 
 


<ul><li>While we completely missed Point Dume State Beach in Malibu after leaving <strong>Santa Barbara</strong> area later than expected (but were rewarded with a gorgeous morning on the terrace and tree-ripened and freshly picked fruit from our AirBnB stay), we did manage an unplanned stop at <strong>Santa Monica’s</strong> boardwalk area/Pacific Park, where Bean had her first ride on a full-sized carousel, which she started in tears but suddenly loved once I stopped holding her (only $2 (!) as a child under 4 with an accompanying paying adult is free – only open on Mondays, Thursdays and weekends before 5pm), and her first ride on a Ferris wheel ($8 but free for child under 3) – she loved it as she thought it was a (giant) swing! We also happened upon some good iced coffee from the Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf chain.</li>


</ul>


 
 


<ul><li>We eventually arrived at <strong>Morro Bay / Los Osos</strong> for the night; it was cloudy and chilly. It seemed like walking distance from one end of town to the other, and it seemed a little strange that an Asian-inspired restaurant would situate itself here – a little gem called <em><a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/nois-little-thai-takeout-los-osos" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Noi’s Little Thai Takeout.</a> </em>I enjoyed the pineapple curry a lot, and the vegetarian spring rolls were crispy too.

</ul>


 
 The next part of the drive was probably my favourite, as we made it to a few of the must-see stops on my list: the <strong>Elephant Seal Rookery</strong>, where we saw elephant seals sun bathe – and while they’re not exactly the cleanest smelling or pretty animals to watch especially when they’re molting, flocks of people came to watch them in their natural habitat anyway; and <strong>McWay Falls</strong> at Julia Pfeffier Burns State Park where a short walk led to an amazing view (Yelp gave a good tip to <a href="https://flic.kr/p/uBegnC" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">park further south</a> to avoid the parking fees). We even stopped through some small town before Big Sur to grab some take-out lunch and we were further rewarded with a nice view (and a surprisingly good veggie deli sandwich).

Though, it seems that trying to find a spot for dinner at many restaurants in Carmel on a Sunday night without reservations is a challenge. Despite it being a chain, the food was surprisingly flavourful and the texture seemed right (self-advertised in-house made pasta better be!) and the menu offered Italian dishes with a twist, like butternut squash ravioli (it was good! but a bit on the heavy side – let’s say it’s from the olive oil). Oddly enough as we were restaurant hunting, j.w bumped into someone he knew that went to his church many years ago (he seems to bump into people at the oddest places, like at the Anchorage airport).</li>


    

<li>We spent my birthday in <strong>Monterey / Carmel area</strong>, starting the Sunday morning off at Monterey Church and ending with a value <a href="http://www.thegrillcarmel.com/thegrill/images/pdf/GRILL_SUNSET.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">3-course early-bird dinner for $26.5 at the Grill</a>. I really enjoyed the Sunday service – especially knowing that Bean was happy at kid’s church and started to enjoy herself after their joint music time. The children’s program seemed pretty extensive at the downtown church, but it was surprising that they didn’t have a potty seat or a smaller toilet for the amount of kids that were there. The music part of the worship service reminded me of a Starfield concert (with the lights, volume, and lyric projection), but I liked how they upcycled palattes to decorate the stage backdrop. The lead pastor is from Altanta and seems like God is using him greatly, as he was invited to speak at a seemingly big worship conference (Spirit West Coast in Ontario, CA) too; I had the impression that he was often jumping back and forth between their churches though. The funny thing is that I stopped noticing his accent shortly into his sermon (side note: the worship pastor’s name inspired me to toy with the idea of naming our next son, Jedidiah, Jedi for short…but that is just going overboard), which covered a passage from a different perspective that I hadn’t considered (except it escapes me right now = mommy brain). I found I also missed times like these where I could focus on listening without the distraction of having to keep Bean entertained (though my mommy side needs to work on trusting strangers to care for her children without parental supervision). Spent the rest of the afternoon doing the 17-mile drive (including Pebble Beach, a paradise for golfers as the green is next to the beach and water!) – which I didn’t enjoy as much, possibly because it was cool and cloudy for the early part of the drive – and ended with making it to our dinner reservations (thankfully, we qualified for that promotion as they didn’t count the 2 girls in our party so we weren’t a party of 6. I chose the sand dabs as it touted to be from Monterey Bay, but was a bit disappointed at the dessert as it as just a scoop of ice cream) </li>


    

<li>Our long-awaited visit to the famous <strong>Monterey Bay Aquarium</strong> was the following day – I thought it was missing some of the views of a higher-end aquarium, like the fish/shark tunnel, but it was really neat to see the fish feeding shows (especially when schools of fish swam to eat) and the vast size of some of the aquariums. I’m still not convinced it was worth the price of admission, but j.w figured if you saw 4 shows and allocated $10 for each of them, that would make the admission worthwhile. I enjoyed our impromptu Surrey rental ride, where 6 adults rode with 2 toddlers up front.  Bean enjoyed it, but Sum Sum was upset after the adults  coordination meant a slight bump into a post. The passion fruit ice cream at Kai Lee Creamery was definitely a worthwhile stop too! We ended up at their Fisherman’s Wharf for dinner, with my parents (who changed their itinerary so they could spend time with us and celebrate my birthday) at <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/abalonetti-bar-and-grill-monterey" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Abalonetti</a>, because <a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CHGA-FuWcAAvphS.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the Grotto was outright not-kid-friendly</a>. I was quite happy with my pizza even though originally I had a hankering for seafood (but nothing stood out to me on their menu) and thought the calamari was only okay (lightly battered but not rubbery at least), but I think my sister got the best deal (lobster tail dinner for $24, enough to split for two). I was a bit disappointed to have missed the buck-a-shuck oysters (though they are from Canada)!</li>


    

<li>In <strong>Santa Cruz</strong>, we spent the morning at Verve coffee, where it felt like a hipster coffee joint; walked along the beach boardwalk, where Bean loved the <a href="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/DSC_0233_edited-1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">gondola ride</a> as she thought it was a giant swing; and had a Hawaiian-themed lunch. Missed out on a poke meal that everyone else got, and settled for the loco moco burrito but found it too much on the protein side, so I ordered a rice wrapped spring roll, which seemed to balance it out. This was our last destination (though we did do a short drive through Half Moon Bay) before we hit the city.</li>


    

<li><strong>San Francisco and beyond</strong>: First dinner at <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/ramen-yamadaya-san-francisco" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Yamadaya Ramen</a> – service was a bit mixed-up but I was happy with my food- especially the thick noodles. We didn’t see much of SF actually due to the limited time we had; the Golden Gate bridge was covered in the famous San Francisco fog, even though Alcatraz could be seen in full site in the opposite direction. We did manage a lunch at Google – great  food for free! – followed by a play date at a nearby playground and another dinner – free buffet – at Twitter! I preferred the personality of the Twitter public spaces than Google’s, perhaps because Google reminded me of Microsoft’s corporate feel. Even the elevators at Twitter felt cooler: you tell it what floor you’d like to go to before you go in, and they send the appropriate elevator to you. We happened upon Chairman Bao’s food truck, but I thought it wasn’t as good this time around, and we lined up for an hour for the Powell-Hyde cable car ride (courtesy of our friends and hosts) which Bean loved, but Sum hated. On a rare rainy day, we spent it at the <strong>Children’s Discovery Museum in San José</strong>, where I learned that Vietnamese is quite prominent in that neighbourhood and where I loved watching Bean enjoy herself there – spending most of her time in the early years area – making the $12 admission for everyone over 1-year-old worthwhile, and then shopping at the Premium Outlets, where you see hoards of Chinese from bus groups go crazy over chocolates at the Ghirardelli Chocolate outlet shop, followed by dinner at the CPK chain.

<ul><li><strong>Wedding! </strong>the point and main purpose of this trip. We made it to the rehearsal, albeit late, after hitting traffic out of SF to Mountain View, following a lunch at the Blue Mermaid and me forgetting to give keys to the guys to grab our belongings so they had to double-back (neat to have a trio of chowders but the waiter missed our appetizer order, which I thought he would have mixed up our chowder orders after he seemingly tried to memorize our 6-person order). Sum cried at the rehearsal but Bean cried at the wedding when being pulled down the aisle in a wagon as flower girls. Rehearsal dinner was a sumptuous and scrumptious Chinese banquet feast! Wedding was followed by a lovely Western-style dinner (with grilled not-overcooked glazed salmon!) with the venue at a community center.

Bean has started talking in 4-5 word sentences since the trip, with some tenses thrown in here and there; I’d like to think the trip was a catalyst.
I had wondered how we would keep two toddlers, especially ours, entertained during the extended time spent awake in the car without resorting to our phones or tablets. The solution ended being a mixture of different things, with these standing out in particular:


<ul><li>snacks, especially used to bribe Bean to settle in her car seat</li>


    

<li>a handmade “quiet” book. I thought her favourite pages would be the belt buckle (as she loves playing with those) but it ended being the clothes line and a random pocket on page tacked on the end that just held loose pieces of felt shapes and felt odd and ends. Funny girl though – she especially enjoyed taking them out and tucking it under her chin or making me clip it on the clothes line. I also quickly discovered that hot glue isn’t good enough; I had needed to do some emergency sewing with a hotel sew kit to make sure pockets didn’t fall apart.</li>


    

<li>drawing with a dry-erase marker quickly ended when it marked up her leggings and the car seat</li>


</ul>

Although she has potty-trained herself for #2 for awhile now, this trip has evidently shown us that she doesn’t like going in public washrooms, even with a potty seat. I don’t blame her, as mommy tends to avoid public washrooms as well. That means she either held it in for the entire day; had many attempts but resulted in false positives; became very upset to the point of crying and holding your hand because she needs to go but can’t, which was made worse when she was in the car seat while the car was in motion; or, accidentally going in her diaper, becoming very upset at that, and then manage to finish up on a toilet.
Also, when you’re eating out every day, we ended up giving her normal adult food (and more junk food like chicken mcnuggets) instead of her usual bland diet. My body, especially my gums, also felt the effects of eating out every day, but soon recovered after we came home – thankfully!

Gasp, can’t believe we’re already at the halfway mark! Bean has been such a distraction that I haven’t counted, Daddy isn’t as involved this time around at coming to midwife sessions and other appointments, and we’re just going with the flow (seems like typical second child syndrome!).
This time, I had an inkling based on the sudden minor weight changes when I was tracking for my fitbit but I had continued to drink a few gulps of beer here and there because I just dismissed that gnawing feeling (guilty!). So, j.w finally went to the dollar store to buy a test to confirm (wow, a huge savings than buying from the pharmacy!). Compared to the last, the symptoms have been pretty consistent, with the exception that my feet feel like it’s pulsing (swollen?) all the time and everything is happening so much sooner:


</p><ul><li>Nausea</li>


    

<li>Food stuck in gums near the teeth</li>


    

<li>Fatigue</li>


    

<li>Round ligament and groin pain (much sooner than first time but surprisingly, chiro visits seem to help!)</li>


    

<li>Abdominal pulling when lifting heavy things</li>


    

<li>Baby bump showing at 3 months instead of later (4-5?)</li>


</ul>


Bean must know something is up (though a fried says it’s a phase even when you’re not expecting) because despite Daddy complaining the she wanted him all the time after our trip, that soon passed and now mommy is super-priority. If she’s around, she’s the one that’s Bean-appointed to buckle her in, sit beside her, hold her, play with her, change diapers, feed her (or assist), change clothes, do the bedtime routine., etc. Thankfully, she knows that Daddy is the one that takes her outside to play in the evenings.
At first, I had wanted to find out about the gender for practical and prep reasons, but last night I changed my mind – because how am I going to keep it a secret from my husband and everyone else for another 20 weeks? The mystery is what makes it a fun surprise for everyone too. The ultrasound technician today was really patient, took many images for us to take home, and showed us a lot of detail, unlike the sonographer (at a lab well known for  pregnancy ultrasounds) <a href="http://her.happyhippos.ca/2013/04/hiding-no-more/">who said it wasn’t for “entertainment purposes”</a>: the heart pulsing (amazing!), spine, hands, feet, eyes (the lens!)…she even said that sometimes you can see the baby pee if she ventures down there (and they just drink it all back, yum). She also explained to me that they’re the eyes for the radiologist, who actually provides an analysis and report to the midwife – and here I thought the technicians did that too! This time, I only drank around 750 ml of water an hour prior, as I couldn’t hold it for the session last time (didn’t help the tech was late). Thankfully, last time, in her empathy, she told me I was allowed to go for 7 seconds (HOW does one cut off pee after exactly 7 seconds especially if they have weak pelvic floor muscles?) and said that they didn’t actually require 1L of water to get good results but it was formally still required (and wondered at how they expected pregnant women told hold so much for so long) so I cheated this time around.
I opted to go with another midwife practice this time around because they have the <a href="http://www.perinatalservicesbc.ca/ForHealthcareProviders/Resources/ConnectingPregnancy.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Connecting Pregnancy</a> group session program, which after attending one session, seems to serve as a good reminder of previous prenatal classes but best of all, it’s free! For one of the activities in the nutrition session, we were asked to shared what we have heard about eating during pregnancy and then discussed whether they were true or false. Most people were surprised and amused at the Chinese pre-cautions around avoiding watermelon (cooling food) until third trimester due to pre-term labour risk and avoiding spicy food, crustaceans, pineapple and mango (hot foods?) due to potential skin allergies that your future baby will develop.
I have some crafting/sewing projects on the go (and in my mind) that I hope we’ll have time to finish before baby arrives, but we’ll see how well that works out and we’ll see if my nesting instinct kicks in this time around. I certainly don’t look forward to pre-washing and prepping baby clothes and gear as laundry isn’t exactly my forté (I tend to forget it in the wash so it doesn’t get to dry right away).]]>
