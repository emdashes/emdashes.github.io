		<p>				with my mind on interviews, i failed to get a good night’s rest. i was plagued with work-related dreams. in one, we were in a classroom/academic setting and my aunt had decided she couldn’t work, so she told me to take her place for the day, even though i had an employer interview with a member of her company later on in the day.</p>




<p>i got up to leave with auntie joan and jemia, who were both going to the same place. but their car was parked elsewhere, and i bumped into zeke midway to my destination and chatted with him for a bit before rushing off to find uncle dennis and jemia in the van. but he had already started the car, so zeke offered to drive me to the parkade to find them. so when i got there, there were many cars but we eventually found them. uncle dennis and auntie joan switched cars and i got into the backseat of the van, while jemia sat shotgun.</p>




<p>i remember going into the company and having the manager really impressed at my work, even though I was only substituting my aunt, and had no idea what i was doing. he wanted me to stay with the team so he tried to get me a job there…</p>




<p>the alarm woke me up.</p>

As I was anxiously awaiting for a very important call this afternoon, I looked outside my window and noticed that the cars passing by my house would swerve into the next lane. Obviously, they were avoiding something ahead, or they all were heading to a house for a party. Soon after, I realised, that 2 <b>undercover police cars</b> had boxed in a minivan (chrysler?). The plainsclothes officers took 2 <b>suspects</b> out for questioning, while they answered with hands <b>handcuffed</b> behind their backs. One officer began to search the van, looking through the garbage bags for something that seemed of importance.</p>




<p>
Peeking from behind the safety of my blinds, I later discovered 2 <b>more suspects</b>, a man and a woman who were brought out from the van, and <b>body searched</b>, to be later <b>placed in a police vehicle</b>. 1 other unmarked police SUV and a marked police car came to help, thus I assume, placing one suspect in each vehicle. Epilogue: I knew the ordeal was over, when I witnessed a <b>tow-truck hauling the minivan</b> away – into the opposite direction that it was originally stopped at. Ahhh, home, sweet home.</p>

Living sacrifice (1 corinthians 12:1). Paul, the rhetoric. What is a living sacrifice? Consider paradoxes from Jesus: the first will be last/last will be first (luke 13:30), servants = friends (john 15:15), death of a kernel producing many seeds (john 12:24)….snowboarding, here i come! 🙂

…and a season for every activity under heaven (Ecclesiastes 3:1). My goodness, what a jammed packed Saturday – including an evening of “firsts”. In the morning, I rolled up my sleeves and received a flu-shot. Thankfully, there were no aftermath effects aside from the mild numbness in my arm. Went w my parents to watch Asian Heros, a Cantonese film (w Engl subtitles) about 5 characters, whose lives are set in a hospital in HK during SARS (based on true stories). I have a nagging suspicion that the movie was not filmed in HK, as led to believe. Early in the movie, there was a shot of “AM Gardens” (representing Amoy Gardens, the apartment complex in HK that was isolated last year due to SARS) but in the corner, part of a sign read 911 (as opposed to 999 since the emergency number in HK, to my knowledge, is still 999).
</p>




<p>
The evening was spent as a guest with P and V at “A Very Vegas Christmas Party”. I had the privilege to join in the festivities of EA’s company party. If “company Christmas party” ever had any negative connotations to it (ie. boring, slow, etc.), this one was far from those adjectives. With most of the attendees under 35 years of old, it seemed more like a big high-school after grad event than a company party. And, Vegas indeed! The Commodore Ballroom was transformed into mini-Vegas, with golden pillared “palm trees”, casino tables with professional dealers and play money, food galore (eg. sushi, roast ham, cheesecake, etc.), free drinks (2 each, though a reliable source says that Mainframe’s (Reboot) party this weekend got 4), and not to mention showgirls and other forms of live entertainment, along with excellent choice of dance music (ranging from Abba’s “Dancing Queen” to Alice Deejay’s “Better Off Alone”). Got to see some sneak previews of some awesome games that are out this year and the next (Shame that I don’t have a console; I wanna play <a href="http://www.easportsbig.com/games/ssx3/home.jsp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SSX3</a>!).</p>




<p>
Echoing V’s thoughts, when asked if we wanted something to drink. — Drink? What is there to drink? I’ve never ordered a drink before consulting a drink menu/bar list. — Anyhow, after thinking the drinks I’ve drank before and knew about, I recalled a citrus juice with grenadine and vaguely remembered it as Tequila Sunrise. I only used 1 of my 2 vouchers because I didn’t want it to affect my driving in any way after the party.</p>




<p>After winning/losing some at the gambling wheel, we made our way to a Blackjack table and P managed to squeeze into a spot. Talking without shouting above the music and din, was next to impossible. Walking without being squished was also next to impossible. However, I was introduced to a few co-workers that P and V knew – the most impressionable (likely because I spoke with them the most) were D and J. D knew P since high school and J was my classmate’s older brother! I would’ve never guessed – they seem to be complete opposites. After leaving for a bit, J came back to see if I wanted to dance because P was still playing, but I was just starting to play (=p) so I convinced him to play with us for a few rounds before he left us to the game to dance again.
</p>



<p>
Thankfully, I was playing Blackjack because I don’t dance nor do I enjoy making a fool outta myself (maybe another drink would’ve done the trick), by myself, in front of a stranger. In any event, after getting bored of Blackjack, P and I couldn’t persuade V to the dance floor, so I took a risk and just joined in for the very first time (yes, i have not been to fed hall in my 5 years at uw apart for grad pics and career fair). I was more of an observer on the dance floor: some were needlessly drunk or definitely buzzed in their crazed dancing, others were sorta swaying to the beat – either dragged on or accompanying their significant others/friends, and still others that definitely had style. There was one chick who had the whole sensual “look-at-my-bod” dance going on the stage, and this other stylin’ chick who really danced with the song (a good version of britney). Looking around, I don’t think DDR or para-para really works in settings like these =þ.</p>




<p>Admittedly, after arriving home past 1 am and not going to bed right away, I was really tired the next day, and it hit during Sunday School. Isaac noted that although I zoned out,it seemed that whenever the prof went to the next point, I’d mysteriously open my eyes and jot it down. Thus, he wasn’t sure if I was sleeping or just picturing the images as Uncle Gordon said he does by closing his eyes during the sermons…er, yeah…

		<p>				last night, i was awoken by a siren wailing by my deathly quiet and creepy street. after being disturbed from the first dream, which i awoke in paranoia (i ended up praying for whomever’s safety), i fell back into a slumber of dreams.</p>




<p>as i entered my home, i began to procedurally try to turn off the alarm. however, every time i would hit one digit incorrectly. eventually, the house alarm went off and the whole neighbourhood heard it. because we were inside, the walls seemed to have filtered out much of the wailing of the alarm. but shortly after, a lady called our house and warned us that if we didn’t turn it off soon, she’d call the city, and they’d have the right to fiine us $35, 000 for noise disturbance.</p>




<p>as someone finally managed to turn it off, two men pull in our driveway in a car and introduced themselves as the police and asked us for our names. they went in to see if they could solve the problem, and after checking it out, they beelined to the basement, where apparently shelves of binders containing serial numbers of all the goods in the house were kept. they saw my 2 cousins jared and gabriel and were playful with them. however, i noticed that they started flipping through the binders and writing information down. i went upstairs and left the kids with the 2 men. by the time i came back down again, the children were crying, and i had realised that the 2 men weren’t police, but sex predators and thieves intending to come back to raid our house another day. thankfully, real police came shortly after and explained to us that they would never introduce themselves or ask us of our names before showing id.</p>




<p>the alarm woke me up.</p>

The UNIX admin overseeing both artsmail and artsweb has ‘politely’ requested (and forcefully terminated) the vicq process on both servers (I switched from one to the other when the first e-mail came explaining that artsmail was meant for mail processes only), thus rendering me icq-less at work for the time being. Thus, if you need to reach me on Tues and Thurs, either e-mail me at artsmail or “finger” me and “talk” to me – but I’m not sure how long that’s going to last either =p.</p>

Christmas. A season on its own – almost – as it extends well before and beyond December 25; one that immediately follows Hallowe’en it seems. Lately, as Christmas music drifts in the background of malls, restaurants, and shops, I wonder if people realise that Christmas isn’t from North America – Santa Claus, elves, reindeers, snow, hollys and jingle bells? You definitely won’t have a white Christmas in places like Australia. As a Chinese girl matter-of-factly stated, “There is Christmas in Asia too,” in reply to her non-Asian friend’s remark that Christmas music in a Chinese restaurant felt out of place.</p>

Flu shots. I think they’re over-rated. And yet, my parents have signed me up with our doctor to get one on Saturday – even though it does cost $25 in BC (I still envy the healthcare sys in ON). You know, at the rate the media is bombarbing the general public with flu reports along with “get your shots today!” ads, the threats of SARS, and with nagging from the parents, grandparents, and other relatives, it almost feels like I’m taking the mark of the beast (see Revelation 13:16) – tho’ I’m sure that would be 100x worse. Did I mention that I don’t like anything jabbing into my skin that isn’t necessary? Ironic. I’ll be viewing a Chinese movie called Asian Heroes (SARS-themed movie) after my flu shot that day (if interested in seeing it, contact me).

<p>
One more thing – in case you were wondering why my website was a bit flaky for the past 48 hours, it was because I switched domain name servers and forgot to set everything up properly. Hopefully, there won’t be anymore interruptions.

<p>many of us were standing around just chatting. a person who was a merge of james and thai was interested in me, but when i told him i had a bf already, they were disappointed but were glad that we could remain friends. as the night wore on, the pastor or some high official explained to us a game where each of us had to be standing on a number, where the sum of the number would be equal or less than what he chose from the box (e.g 15 = 1+5=6). for some reason, i had in my head that 7 would be the safest bet especially since during the first run through, most people got up and walked to the number that he picked. but then, he realised that people were cheating. so, in the second time through, i walked over to where carey was standing and chose the 7 – which btw, was the right side of the room/auditorium.</p>




<p>the second time around, the official picked 7 and his helpers walked around choosing the winners – those who were under or at 7. when he got to me, he led me into this room, where there were about 4-5 round/long tables (w.o a lazy susan) and i joined uncle peter and family, along with other couples and ppl from church. then they started to serve us chinese food – so much food! i later found out that most of the younger guys who won got to attend the NHL hockey game instead; i was sooo envious.</p>




<p>then, i realised that those who lost that game, ended up in one big cage (like a prison)…although i noticed that many of them were not females. i made a note about that and asked someone, who said that they wanted to avoid the harsh conditions for the females so they only chose the females that had the tough attitude. some teens were in a separate “cage” and it started getting chaotic. graffitti was sprayed everywhere and threats of violence, which resulted in some teens standing outside and shooting at another trapped in the cage.</p>




<p>i decided that i had enough, so i returned home to bed, making sure to lock up all the doors and windows and making sure that the interconnecting room/house (sort of like a duplex) were all locked as well because of the condition around the neighbourhood. it was sort of sad to see that the interconnecting place was empty, because that was where joseph lived and i had no idea whether he was at the game or in the prison. </p>

On our way out after a talk by David C. Bentall last week, YY shouts, “Bye, Sheila!” I ignored the farewell until it registered to me that someone I knew just mistook me for my sister! I walked back and made it a point tell her that I wasn’t Sheila. And, when I did, she just had this blank look on her face and in bewilderment asked, “You’re not?! Then, who are you?” This incident reminded me of what happened last Christmas when I arrived at church before my sister. I went over to Becky to chat with her (fellow UWer). Tunger, one of my sister’s friends whom I didn’t know at the time, came up to me and greeted me with a familiar hello. I said hi back and Becky/I told him that I wasn’t Sheila. Turns out that he later tells my sister that he thought that I was her…this happened not only once, but three more times during this summer/fall season! I think he can tell us apart now, just because we’ve hung out more…it’s a good thing that my sister and I aren’t identical twins – else ppl would only be more confused!
</p>



<p>
PS. Hi Anne! How did you find me? I don’t think I know who you are, but nice to “meet” you 🙂

Wow, this past term has been greaat! I feel like I’m on co-op with Waterloo-ers – I’ve been seeing at least one every week ever since Shaun came =) (but it also means that I’m going out too much). Anyhow, onto my story:
</p>



<p>
With three hours of sleep at 5:45 on Saturday morning, I skytrain it down to meet up w J.Chor, T.Sung, V.Hong, P.Chung, E.Chung, and K.Chiu for a full-day at the slopes on <b>Blackcomb</b> (Whistler was closed). By the time we got our rentals and lift tickets (@ the early season price), it was close to noon. I am extremely grateful for Vaugham who ended up riding with me (it was his third time, my second) as everyone else minus Jesse chose to ski and were quite advanced. Our first run down was the <b>Magic Chair</b> (1 hill more “advanced” than the bunny hill) – <b>I fell every three seconds</b> and forgetting how to get up again. By the time I got down (w/ everyone waiting for me), we decided that we’d (V and I) do a few more of those while the others went on the advanced runs. However, after doing about 4-5 of the Magic Chair runs, V and I got pretty bored because it was quite short and I stopped falling as often (total of maybe 3-4 falls with one being like the triple axel but not in the air); however, the other guys hadn’t come down yet. At about 14:40, 20 mins before the lifts closed for uploading, we just didn’t have anymore patience to wait for them and went off to the <b>Wizard Express</b> on our own. On the way up, I spotted Peter’s thug outfit, so I yelled down, and I think Emily heard me, so they knew we left w/o them. V and I mastered the art of getting off the lifts w/o falling by that point (so I knew that I have improved!), but when we attempted to go down the green run, we discovered that it was quite narrow and steep at some parts, but very flat in others. At one point, V’s legs started cramping up so he told me not to wait for him since he’d catch up (and I was positive he would since he’s better than I am)…so I took off. Shortly after, I somehow lost control and fell, but <b>slid off the side of the slope (read: cliff)</b>.</p>




<p align="left">
Yep, that was basically what I looked like. Thank God that <b>my board jammed into the tree stump</b>, else I’d be a looong way from the edge and it would be a loong way down. The first thing I tried to do was to see if I could move (I landed quite awkwardly). I discovered that my limbs were okay, but to my horror, when I tried to move (to release my feet from the board), the snow would crack and <b>I’d sink</b> a bit. That wasn’t good news especially seeing that I could see that the snow was not packed down and it looked quite deep between the cracks. I’m not really the type to panic, so after resting on another tree stump (that was conveniently behind my head acting as a pillow), I slowly and cautiously unlatched my board (as they didn’t give us a leash, I was so afraid I’d lose the board and haveta pay). Meanwhile, I kept looking back to see if I could spot V ride past me, but to my dismay, I never saw him. The <b>ski patrol guy even zoomed by</b> twice without seeing me.
</p>



<p>
With the board released, I threw it on top of the stump upside down so it would not go anywhere. As I strategized in my mind on what to do next (to pull myself back up), two Australian(? – cool accents) guys on skis stopped and peered over the edge (ahh, <b>my knight(s) in shining armour!</b> =p – or perhaps my guardian angels since they came shortly after I whispered a prayer to God) and asked if I needed some help. I took it. Once I was safely up, they made sure I was okay, one asked for my name and told me his before taking off. Thanks <b>Rory</b>! =)</p>




<p>
Turns out, V didn’t see me fall, so he just thought I was ahead, but by the time he got to the <b>Exaclibur</b> lifts, he didn’t see me and waited for me for about 30-40 mins (while drinking free hot chocolate) before taking the lift down because the rest of the run was closed. By the time I got off the lift (with a Corey Ahn (read: korean) who was visiting for 6 months and came to Canada to learn English), V just returned his rentals and told me his side of the story (approx 16:00) and we “chilled” /warmed up over a hot drink at <b>Second Cup</b>. We <b>lost the rest of the team</b> though and took us til about 18:00 to find them (when the rentals were up). Thank you V, for keeping me company – even though we started the day off as complete strangers! My, what an adventure!
</p>
