Did you know that there may be a half dozen of demodex folliculorums on each of your eyelashes? Demodex folliculorum is a complex name for a follicle mite. Follicle mites have eight legs and are very tiny. These relatives of the spider live and feed on our eyelashes.</p>




<p>
The mites make their home in hair follicles. There they hatch, mate, and then die. They feed by puncturing the cells of our eyelash follicles with two tiny needles from their bodies and then pumping out fluid from those cells. Fortunately, these tiny little creatures are unharmful and they are so small that we don’t even know that they are there, although if you look carefully, you may be able to find one yourself.</p>




<p>
Finding mites may not be as simple as you think. It requires both time and patience. One way is by closely examining an eyelash. Carefully pluck an eyelash from your eye and place it on a drop of water. Take a strong magnifying glass and carefully examine the eyelash through it. You may be able to see those tiny mites and possibly some other creatures as well. Who knows, maybe you’ll even have a whole family of living organisms (living) there.</p>




<p>
You now know about these follicle mites and how to look for one, but did you know that these mites are outnumbered by other mites living with us? Some of thse other mites feed on dead skin from our bodies. There may be as many as two million mites on each of your mattresses and on your carpets! Thank goodness that they are perfectly harmless {or are they?}. Now if someone asks you what that is on your eyelash, you’ll know what to say right?

And, I thought ‘loo was becoming a distant memory.
<br>In the past week, I have come to realise two things about my relationship with my Saviour:


</p><ol><li>When I am talking with Him in my warm, relaxing bed, it is comforting to know that I can fall asleep safely in His arms while in mid-conversation. Got insomnia? Start praying (although, it only seems to work in bed, it has the opposite effect on the bus) =p</li>



<p>


</p><li>I long to go back to ‘loo, not only to visit those I have known for a long time, but sometimes, I wish that I had the opportunity to develop deeper friendships with those that I’ve just met in ‘loo or only recently gotten to know. Funny how life is, the narrator in the song, Big Yellow Taxi laments, “you don’t know whatcha got til it’s gone…”, and it’s often quite true. Yet, how does that relate to my relationship with Christ? Well, thanks to instant messaging clients and technologies, I “talk” to my friends. But, because IM doesn’t happen in “realtime”, I’m really missing seeing the other side of them or getting to know the “real” person(s). The desire to meet with them only increases. So, why is it that even though I converse with God daily, I’m perfectly content and satisfied with not seeing Him? Is it because I see His work around me or does my head know that I probably won’t ever see God until <i>that</i> day comes? I somehow don’t think that should be true, because the deeper your relationship is with someone, the more natural it would be to want to see him/her face to face! Anyhow, something to think about…</li>




</ol>

		<p>				
I am in the process of cleaning my room, unpacking boxes that were packed ages ago. I came across a bunch of characteristics some of my friends from church had written down back in high school. What they don’t know, is that I somehow managed to get my hands on it. So, I hereby now present: what women want in an “ideal guy” – from the male’s perspective:</p>


Top 8


<ol><li>caring</li>




<li>handsome; *attractive*; in some cases, a nice body; well-groomed</li>




<li>romantic</li>




<li>rich; in some cases, money; resources ($$$); a car and money “just kidding”</li>




<li>loving, want to be loved</li>




<li>supportive, encouraging</li>




<li>intelligent; educated</li>




<li>they want someone they can control =p (ie. the more the guy can do for her, the better…image, skills, talents); control (paying bills)</li>


</ol>


Others


<ul><li>confidante – soul mate</li>




<li>sensitive</li>




<li>understanding</li>




<li>respectful</li>




<li>truthful</li>




<li>treats them as equals and not sex objects</li>




<li>nice, kind, personality</li>




<li>good in bed (in some cases) or good at making love</li>




<li>a good future</li>




<li>things in common</li>




<li>responsible</li>




<li>spontaneous</li>




<li>brave</li>




<li>compatible</li>




<li>forgiving</li>




<li>patient</li>




<li>trustworthy</li>




<li>multi-talented</li>




<li>well-rounded</li>




<li>sense of adventure</li>




<li>macho</li>




<li>chauvanistic</li>




<li>socialable</li>




<li>family man</li>




<li>handi-man</li>




<li>open</li>




<li>want to be held</li>




<li>want to feel wanted</li>




<li>want to be respected</li>




<li>want to feel needed</li>

At the moment, I’m really, really peeved at two things:</p>




<p>
(1) How do I increase the speed of my Internet connection with the wireless router? After we took out the hub, and installed the wireless, the computers that are connected to the router via cable seemed to have slowed down incredibly in terms of download and upload speed…to the point that whenever my brother needs to use it to download movies, he hasta disconnect the rest of the house so that he can directly connect his computer to the modem…leaving me, well, disconnected from the rest of the world for 15+ hours (like now) =|. Now my brother wants to buy another switched hub so that he can have one port to his computer and the other to the router. I’ve never seen or heard anyone do such a thing, and personally, I think it will be a waste of money. Does anyone know a fix or the reason for this problem? I’d appreciate it, and if you can fix it or know a solution, I owe you a bubbletea =).</p>




<p>
(2) Does everyone <i>intentionally</i> fail to stop at stop signs?! If the driver doesn’t care for himself or herself, fine, but think about the safety of your passengers, and especially if the car you’re driving isn’t your own! Sometimes I have to think twice about going into someone’s car because of that. I remember in Vaughan, one of our friends drove us out for dessert. When I realised how dangerously he drove, I silently prayed for our safety (I also do that when I’m with another driver that goes 200 km/hr on the 401). I’ve recently found out that my sister and my brother are no different and when reminded, they just respond with, ‘Oh, I looked both ways already…’ *sigh*. If I ever make the same mistake for not stopping at an intersection, please point it out to me. I guess I’m just edgy with such small details not because I don’t trust your driving, but because of a careless pedestrian or another driver. I don’t ever want my sister or brother’s passenger(s)/or other drivers/pedestrians to end up in a hospital and have the patient(s) make them pay for their negligence. Selfishly speaking, I also don’t want to have to be put in a position where I’m tempted to blame and not forgive if anything happens (and knowing God’s sense of humour, I’d probably be tested in this very way because of my weakness (should I rejoice?) O_o).</p>

My sister invited me out to her birthday dinner/party tonight where she invited about 18 of her other friends. Thankfully, Jasmine (not you jazy, but you know, the girl you conversed with on icq =p) and Jeremy were there, otherwise I would not have attended. Tunger surprised me by showing up because my sister told me that I’d only know two people. As reluctant as I was to go, because a) I don’t normally hang out w my sis or her friends, and b) I really dislike big groups and loitering periods, I must say that I’m thankful for her invitation and that my sister ended up arranging everything for me, so I didn’t haveta worry about getting there or back. The few hours spent in the corner with Tunger, Jerms, and Jazz really helped me in re-adjusting back to life at BAC (or w BACers). It wasn’t the food, but more of the sense of fellowship and openess that I sensed, and I believe that it was indeed the first time I really felt that I was ‘home’ again; the first time that conversation really slipped past the tip of the iceberg (you know, the ‘oh, how are you doing? are you still looking for job?’ standard phrases–really, Joe, I think sarcasm and teasing has its time and place and it breaks the ice a lot faster!). Tunger was sincerely interested in what I was doing or did, and likewise, I found out that he’s the complete opposite of me: he’s working on a CS major with a English minor –I just thought that was rather neat! =) </p>




<p>
From what Jerms shared with me, I realised that I wasn’t the only one that struggled with finding my place back at church again – I totally forgot that he was gone for awhile as well; look at him now, he’s even the deacon! Oh, how self-absorbed I am, just looking at the world in my own little bubble =|. And, I guess I can’t totally blame the people for chattin’ in their own little groups. What Jerms said was right, it’s not like I’m that easy to talk to either. During church loitering time, I just sorta stand aloof, not really in the mood for conversation most of the time as I rather like avoiding  superficial Q&As from strangers and acquaintances (‘So, how was your week?’). I know that I can step out of my comfort zone to talk to those who are ‘ngon gui gui’ looking around as if they’re lost too instead of staying back at a distance surveying the crowd. Alas, I don’t (oh, woe to me!).</p>




<p>
I’ve been awoken. Funny, how God speaks to you via people and in places where you least expect Him to – and I’m sure that they don’t even realise how much they’ve made a difference. Hopefully, things will only get better from here…=)</p>

Story of the week:
A MSN friend <i>proposed</i> to me yesterday. Why?<br>
Read on to find out…


</p><blockquote>
(Context) -Oh my gosh. It takes you 5 minutes to reboot? What are you using? a 286?<br>
me: it just hung at the “windows is shutting down” window, so i had to do a hard reboot<br>
him: “hung” and “hard reboot” … coming out of a female mouth.. or fingers, whatever.. wow. that’s..<br>
him: that’s… wow. You know, it’s no wonder you have a boyfriend. Guys would be quite attracted to that. Wow.</blockquote>






<p>
..then further down the conversation, he ‘pops’ the question..
</p>




<blockquote>
him: Will you marry me?
<br>
[The reasons?]<br>
-What, a fusion of technically and artistically inclined dispositions in a girl?<br>
-Hard to find, believe me.<br>
-Impossible, some might even suggest.
</blockquote>




<p>
I’m not a woman who fights for her rights in equality. In fact, I find these comments really, really amusing (did you know that ‘a-muse’ in latin translates to “without thought”?) most of the time. Mostly because I like to break the stereotypes fused in people’s – *ahem*,  mostly guys’ – minds; it’s quite satisfying and especially fun to see/hear their reactions. I know girls, who are just as knowledgeable in such areas as I am–e.g. wujj, lil. In this day and age, I wouldn’t be surprised if girl power took over and showed the guys what we’re capable of! =) My MSN friend is funny – even if this was all, or partially, in jest. Seriously though, <b>are guys really attracted to that, or to girls like that</b>?!
</p>



<p>
Oh, while we’re on the same topic, here’s one found in my guestbook that was posted a few years back by a friend of mine, whom I’ve known since early high school:</p>




<blockquote>
“Lovely page. I didn’t know that girls can code in HTML! Hahah! Okay. That’s my chauvinistic remark for the evening. Hopefully I’ll see you around, so we can be in a photo together.Cheers,-Peter Parker”
</blockquote>




<p>
He’s a riot too! Sarcasm is his middle name. =)

		<p>				Hey, this is a new interface, as most have already noticed! Anyhow…</p>




<p>…Melody and I bumped into into Sera, her sister, and Sera’s friend Stephanie, whom I have never met. They were all a little drunk because they wanted to drown their family problems, but Stephanie still wanted to drive home .</p>




<p>As Melody and I walked from the mall, where we bumped into Sera et al., we passed by a bunch of strangers, standing on a sidewalk outside of a church. I initally didn’t pay any attention to them, but one of them started talking to me, and prompted me to ask if he was the same person that I was talking with on ICQ last night. Turns out that he was! So Melody and I stopped to take a tour of the church and talk to the rest of the people. Inside, I find out that a meeting was taking place, and that the producers of Veggie Tales were there! The funniest thing was that I only knew because they were sporting Veggie Tale costumes. Phil Viscer (sp?) was wearing a Bob the tomato outfit, and the co-producer was wearing something else. At the end of the meeting, they showed us outside where the shop was. Some of their stuff was on sale, but I didn’t end up buying anything.</p>




<p>As we exited, one of the girls who worked there just got off from her shift and so she offered to show us around town. We went with her behind the store, into the alley, where she proceed to pin up her curled hair like a gypsy and told us to call her by Peggy, as her name by night was not the one she went by during the day. She led us to where she worked at night, but before going in, she warned us that the place may be surrounded by police anytime. We were also under the impression that the people she would be interacting with would be speaking in Spanish.</p>




<p>As we approached we heard people behind us, and beams from flashlights. She instinctively knew tht it was the police, and quickly led us to a shed where there was one window. She locked the shed door and we flattened ourselves against the wall where the window was so that when beams shone through, it would be less likely to find our shadows. Somehow, I found my brother in the opposite corner, and my sister ended beside me instead of Melody. We embraced to keep each other warm and to comfort each other…</p>

		<p>				
Wow, this past week was the week of new:


</p><ul><li>new leather couches: woohoo, finally, something to sit on to watch tv!</li>




<li>new running shoes: yaay, i don’t haveta risk twisting my ankles anymore in my sis’ oversized shoes while i’m playin’ badminton! </li>




<li>new beach/outdoor sandals: i can follow to the bc trend/phenomenon of wearing socks w/ sandals now if i want, but i don’t think i will 🙂</li>




<li>new car: with the old one totalled after it was stolen, parents decided to get a relatively cheaper car that offered trunk space – and announced the purchase of a toyota matrix :|…it’s new and it’s better than the other van that my dad was thinking of buying 🙂 – prayers answered!</li>




<li>new thanksgiving: although everything seems to be of material value, i guess that’s something to be thankful for, to be able to afford all these things…a change from the past. after being away for 5 years, this particular thanksgiving, i spent it with my family. although this year, unlike the past, we didn’t have thanksgiving; not in the sense of big dinners with family and relatives: no turkey, no roast ham/beef, no cranberry sauce O_o. I fondly remember the days when no one remained in ‘loo for thanksgiving, when only about 6 of us gathered around the Wai’s dinner table to enjoy the food and hear about PT and Chris’ stories when they were dating, and even before…so maybe, next year, there will be thanksgiving food =).</li>


</ul>

I think most of my biases against a certain christian campus fellowship seems to have dissipated for the time being, just from attending one session. firstly, i feel like i’m back at CCF…where the programs are structured, organised, and most people you talk to are relatively friendly. There really isn’t an urge to go anywhere after the meeting is over, nor do I feel like wanting to get up mid-way and leaving because I’m so attracted to the joy and fellowship that seems to radiate from the (people in the) room. Anyhow, I do believe that I found my “spot” but I gotta continue to attend for the next few weeks just to confirm my initial impression – I’ve tried out another one for 3 weeks now, and well, I guess it’s just not my style. Wait til Matt C. hears that! I remember solidly saying that as much as I support the organisation and truly enjoy working for them, I don’t like his fellowship because of one noticeable trend: that many leaders marry young and then decide to join staff. I guess I just wanted to avoid that pattern repeating in my life! haha. I know at least 3 couples in ON, 1 in NS, and 3 in BC — if not more. Aside from my confuzzled reaction upon hearing that the Holy Spirit needs to be invited into a Christian’s life time and time again, originally, what kept me back were the words spoken by some leaders/people that I truly respected (and still do) that implied that serving at CCF wasn’t as important as serving with them — because by serving with them, I could change the world on the larger scale. CCF? they only minister to a small circle within the larger one–mainly the needs of CBCs, Cantonese and Mandarin speakers (which btw, is exciting stuff esp now – God is evidently at work w both our newest ministries: mCCF and cCCF!). I guess at the time, those words really hurt me, but someone later explained that they only tried to make me commit to one ministry, so to not spread myself thin and to serve the best I can offer in one area. That made so much more sense, I think if they had said that to begin with, it would make it sound less like they were trying to take me away from another fellowship that I was already quite attached with…anyhow, I’m excited to see what is to come for the remainder of the term =). It’s refreshing to go back to work feeling all..refreshed =). (an aside for my own reflection — a statement someone said today that caused me to scratch my head and come to this conclusion: unlike a nagging child begging for a toy from its parent, who usually relents/ gives in to quiet the kid, if you keep nagging God to give you something, he won’t necessarily give it to you esp if it’s not beneficial for you or if it’s not according to His will…even if you try to A.S.K – Matthew 7:7)

My computer is finally up and running, with wireless networking and all 🙂 I came back in August, only to find that my dad had bid on yet another computer from an auction. *eyes rolling*…we now have a total of 4 functional (ie. quite good) computers, 3 of which are hooked up. To my dismay, I soon learnt that the newest one had an integrated motherboard. From previous experience with the Gateway system downstairs, I was not one happy camper. Unfortunately, the parts from my previous computer (which jozie helped me take apart to bring back here) were mostly not compatible – especially my AGP ATI-chipset Radeon 9000(?). Thankfully, all my unused parts are now being put to good use by L’il Boy Bloo. I guess I’m fortunate to be able to claim the fastest(?) machine in the house, even though it only has PCI slots. Because the computer system was sold at an auction, the HP labels were removed, so I can to really only guess at the components and the system. From research online, this is what I think my system is – HP Pavilion 533 Configurable Desktop, with the following components:


</p><ul><li>Intel Celeron 2.0GHz w 400 MHz system bus speed
</li>



<li>Intel Integrated Motherboard (Intel Extreme Graphics) w 845GL Chipset</li>




<li>256 MB DDR RAM/PC 2100</li>




<li>60 GB HD</li>




<li>Maxtor 40 GB HD (from old system)</li>




<li>HP 8x8x40 CDRW+ 16x DVD-ROM combo drive</li>




<li>MSI 40x12x48 CDRW drive (from old system)</li>




<li>AC Live ’97 integrated sound</li>




<li>6 USB 2.0(?), 1 serial, 1 parallel ports</li>




<li>Cheetah 2 v.92 56K modem (don’t think it’s gonna be used much)</li>


</ul><p>
I guess overall, it’s a better system than my old one b/c it operates faster. Someone still needs to show me how to overclock it :). I’m having a hard time adjusting to a small monitor tho :)…I think it’s either a 12 or an 15 inch…=p.
