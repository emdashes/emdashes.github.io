		<p>				Ralph S. Mouse (the S stands for smart)


Let’s begin with a story of the mouse. If you have followed my stories for some years now, you might recall <a href="https://her.happyhippos.ca/2008/04/mouse-in-house/">the story of j.w catching a live mouse with a waste basket</a>. I was hoping it was a one-time incident; instead, I found myself mentioning to j.w that I saw a grey blob scurrying near the baseboard on the kitchen floor as I was chatting with j.wu after small group one night. j.w investigated and found some droppings in the corner of our kitchen floor! We eventually found a few favourite places it liked to hide when we saw signs of it: particularly behind the bookcase in the basement and behind/in the stove; and, I had accidentally discovered where it likely came from: the range hood vent. I only know this because I went into the cupboard above the stove and found the silicon sleeve on our coffee carafe broken. My first thought? How cheap! And then, one of us realized it had been chewed through. Lo and behold, there was a bunch of droppings all over the cupboard, which of course I had missed because of my height. Who knows how long it’s been living among us!
So, the cat and mouse game began. First, the live traps were placed, but they consistently turned up empty, and there was no sign of a mouse anywhere; it seemed that even the food crumbs from our children’s messy eating habits were ignored. Until. I found a bun stuck between where the oven vents out into the stove a couple of weeks later. I was baffled at how it got there as I had thrown it out into the green bin bag myself; then I realized that the mouse must have tried to sneak it into its hiding place by going through the oven vents and because the bun was so big, it jammed!! Well, within 24 hours of placing the snap trap that PT recommended, it caught it. And, there hasn’t been a mouse indoors since.  And now, the little ants have returned (they get into the house every spring for a few weeks until the powder keeps them away); oddly [ref] it’s odd because she’s afraid of bugs in general, like spiders [/ref], Bean says she likes them and even have picked up a few to watch them crawl on her hands.


</p><hr><h2>120 km/h wind storm</h2>


If a trees falls in a forest, does it make a sound? It certainly makes a big splash.
Then there was the ice storm and the wind storm, followed by some wicked summer weather (30C plus). The ice storm wasn’t much of an ice storm compared to the earlier ones, but the wind storm knocked down many trees. I happened to be sitting on the couch looking out into the forest and saw a giant tree fall into the bog – it was quite the splash. Our loose fascia ripped off and it’s missing – but we discovered that it was loose in the first place because annoying wasps had made a nest under it a while back. But, we were the fortunate ones, roofing and other repair companies are at capacity for the next month or so because some other houses had batches of shingles and even the siding at the side of the house stripped off from the wind! I still see big trees on the ground or on wooden fences around the neighbourhoods we drive by.


<hr><h2>Team dynamics</h2>


I’m approaching 6 months, and a new office! Within the last few months, I’ve discovered some interesting stats about the makeup of our current team; our newest hire will change it but until then:

<hr><h2>Nose injuries</h2>


Well, since our mild hand-foot-mouth incident with our little guy (“diagnosed by Google” when we noticed that his fingernails were peeling a few weeks following rash symptoms), he’s had a couple of accidents:


<ol><li>He fell from the steps onto his nose. Thankfully, it was a superficial injury, so it healed up relatively quickly. Now we can say that they both have fallen down the stairs at the same age (she rolled down a whole flight from what I could tell and sustained carpet burn injuries)</li>


    

<li>A few weeks later, after it healed, he falls from a trike onto the gym floor and on his nose again. His nose was bleeding off and on for a day, so we took him to the doctor before a trip, just to make sure he was okay. Thankfully, he was fine (and no concussions either as they don’t wear helmets inside)!</li>


</ol><hr><h2>The better surprises</h2>


Two visits – the highlights!


<ol><li>A lovely visit from a friend and her family from Hong Kong, whom I haven’t seen in a few years 🙂</li>


    

<li>A last-minute trip to Orlando (again) for almost a week – a separate post will follow  since we skipped all theme parks this time around!</li>

		<p>				When short prayers get answered quickly:
Along our walk home today, I discovered that we lost a Kombi mitt. We retraced our steps back to school and even checked the lost and found without it turning up.
As we were heading back, I told Bean that we should pray about it and ask God for help in returning it. Why of course, just as we leave from the school yard, I see a pink mitt standing tall on a wire-fence post near a tree. Some kind soul must have put it there in hopes it would be reunited with its other half. Yet, I had missed seeing that when we had first entered the school yard even though it was completely in my line of sight!


This week, Bean went on a class field trip to a grocery store within walking distance. The teachers had asked them to put their mitts inside the sleeves of their jackets so they wouldn’t lose it. Sometime between the trip and the day of the school day, one of her pink Kombi mitts went missing, again!
No, it wasn’t in her sleeves, not in the lost and found at Sobeys or at the school, wasn’t in her cubby, and it didn’t reappear by the end of the next day. By the third day, as I was getting out of the car to pick her up, I sort of mumbled a quick prayer, hoping for a miracle because I liked these much more than the hot paws we had. I even thought about retracing the steps they took, but when I saw her, she happily waved her two hands, with <i>both </i>Kombi mitts on them! <i>Answered prayers!</i>
Although she couldn’t quite tell me where she found them initially, she then told me she found it in her cubby; her teacher told me she had emptied her cubby and looked multiple times without seeing anything. Later on, Bean tells me what sounds a tall tale (but more likely a true one from her perspective that looks drastically different to an adult): that her mitt was hanging above her cubby from the ceiling and she had to take a block as a stool to stand up to reach it.
Stranger things have happened (e.g. me finding a lost wedding ring in grass; a lost diamond in a car trunk) [ref] this is all connected to one of my first summer camp experiences where a camp counsellor-later turned pastor told us a story about how he couldn’t find his keys, so he knelt down and prayed and as soon as he was done, God opened his eyes and it was somehow right in front of him; he didn’t know how he could’ve missed it before! This story has stuck with me and has empowered me to pray, especially when things are lost [/ref], so this is just one of the many times where God shows up in the little things! (Still missing the wallet with $400US so not all prayers get answered with a yes right away).]]>		</p>

		<p>				went to Vancouver last year with two little ones, I wanted to minimize the amount of gear I needed to carry. Thankfully my sister’s kids are the same size, so I was able to limit my luggage to just a carry-on suitcase, a backpack (with snacks and activities), one car seat, and a diaper bag. I didn’t have to take a car seat with me, but I decided that having one on board would be safer and better overall, so I had to find a way to lug it without needing to carry it.


</p><h2>The suitcase stroller</h2>


I looked online for ideas, and saw a couple of products to help mitigate this problem – one was a foldable trolley where you put the car seat (and child in) and the other was a strap that looked like a T where it attached the car seat to a carry-on suitcase. Well, I didn’t want to buy anything that was only useful in this situation or bring along anything extra (like the trolley), so I tried to use what I had to mimic the T-strap. A mom in a local mom’s Facebook group asked me to post some screens of my setup when she saw a photo of what I did, and j.w wanted to record a video of it, so he did a wonderful job of capturing my explanation, Bean and all:

For those who don’t want to watch the unedited video, read on for some written instructions.


<h3>Materials</h3>

This is what I used – and what you might need:


<ul><li><b>An adjustable luggage strap</b>. You might be able to get away without this if the LATCH straps on your car seat are long enough to wrap around to the back of the suitcase; mine cannot. It seems that Asian families back in the day were known to wrap their suitcases with luggage straps (to keep it together and to see it easier on the carousel, maybe?), so it was quite easy for me to find one lying around. I like this particular one because there is a loop in it that the carabiner clips in so it’s snug and it doesn’t move. I’ve also used a bungee cord in a pinch, when I left my luggage strap behind – but I didn’t feel it was safe to put a child in it then.</li>


    

<li><b>One carabiner</b>. If it’s weight supported (such as ones meant for climbing), it’s probably safer; mine’s not.</li>


    

<li><b>A key ring</b>, O-ring, or D-ring. You might be able to get away without this if the top tether can clip to the carabiner, but I find it much easier with it. Probably safer if it’s weight-tested as well. If you get rid of your luggage strap, you would need this so that the LATCH clips can clip/hook onto the ring.</li>


</ul><h3>The setup</h3>


[caption id="attachment_6503" align="alignright" width="225"]<img class="wp-image-6503 size-medium" src="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/DSC_0159-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300" srcset="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/DSC_0159-225x300.jpg 225w,https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/DSC_0159-768x1024.jpg 768w,https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/DSC_0159-1568x2091.jpg 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px"> A closer look at what it looks like after everything is connected together[/caption]
A three-step summary:


<ol><li>Match the back of the car seat against the front of the carry-on suitcase when vertically standing</li>


    

<li>Thread the luggage strap through the car seat where the seat belt would go for a forward-facing set up, and adjust so that car seat is snug against the suitcase. If there are handles on your suitcase, put the luggage strap through them (the video shows the straps are twisted – try to make sure they’re flat before continuing).</li>


    

<li>Take the top tether of the car seat and thread it through the handles on top of the suitcase and the handle bar (I pull up the handlebar to make it easier), and hook and clip the tether to the ring, or the carabiner, if you don’t use a ring. Tighten, tilt, and test it out.</li>


</ol>


With the car seat strapped to the carry-on suitcase, I could either put all my stuff into the seat while Bean helped roll it, or she sat in it and helped hold some stuff, while I wore my 18 month old in a carrier. People looked our way, but I’m not sure if it’s because people haven’t seen others do this, and/or they were thinking what kind of crazy parent would do that. On Air Canada (Dreamliner specifically), I can roll this contraption down the aisle and get to my seat without undoing anything, but it does not fit down the aisle on WestJet or Air Canada Rouge planes – some will fit down business class but once you get to economy, you will quickly find out it doesn’t fit so it’s better just to undo it in the area where parents gate check their strollers and car seats. You will also need to buffer a little more time to take it apart and put it together again as you go through security screening.

		<p>				
Two years ago, we were celebrating <a href="http://her.happyhippos.ca/2016/02/two-month-milestones/">two month milestones</a>. Now, at 2, he’s come a long way:


</p><ul><li>Speaks in complete sentences. Has started to communicate (and copy) in English. Boo.</li>


    

<li>Enjoys climbing and doing crazy things and will deliberately test boundaries with people in authority (me – he’s heavy so I can’t just pick him up and grab him while grocery shopping for example, so I don’t go when I’m on my own as it’s impossible to get more than one or two things in one trip)</li>


    

<li>Loves to sing, and can sing many songs in English including the Alphabet song, Twinkle Twinkle Little Star, Away in the Manger, Roly Poly and can sing along with or recognize songs by Walk Off the Earth, Moana, and Frozen.</li>


    

<li>Loves trains, especially Thomas. And cars. And airplanes. Prefers trains though, if given a choice.</li>


    

<li>Easily sucked in by technology: photos on the phone, TV, iPad game, and YouTube videos. One time early on, the caregiver gave an older child a tablet to use while the younger ones were supposed to nap; he had a meltdown and refused to sleep. Then she figured out why (we had warned her prior so she made the connection and no more problems since).</li>


    

<li>Has not completely weaned. So, I’m still off dairy and some nuts. Nuts!</li>


    

<li>While he started off with liking meat, he doesn’t seem to like meat (fish the exception) as much anymore, unless it’s chicken nuggets/fingers/crispy. He will still eat it but when it is in chunks, he tends to pick it out. He also doesn’t like green fiber veggies, but will repeatedly down it in smoothie form. Like his sister, he loves fruit. Avocados, bananas, and cereal with alternative milk are now his favourite breakfast foods. He is a soup and rice monster. Sometimes noodles too.</li>


    

<li>Self-toilet training is hit and miss so far – and if successful, it’s still only #2 (though a few times, he wakes up with a dry diaper and will go if you put him on the toilet); progress seems to have slowed down or regressed especially now that he doesn’t tell his caregiver he needs to go (or maybe she hasn’t learned the signs yet)</li>


    

<li>He may have had a mini <a href="http://her.happyhippos.ca/2017/04/the-day-we-had-our-first-ambulance-ride/">febrile seizure</a> the other week, when he had a slight fever (while fighting off strange rashes – maybe mild symptoms of hand, foot, mouth + reaction to lactose in Tylenol) but it lasted no more than a few seconds and it was in his sleep.</li>


    

<li>He seems interested in people he knows (and babies) – often willing to share a toy, asking for someone by name, offering hugs to those he loves (except it’s sad to see hugs not reciprocated, especially when his sister comes out from dance class and he goes to hug her and she brushes him off; however, she always asks to go into timeout with him when he’s in trouble), and enjoys helping out in the kitchen (putting dishes away, watching and helping mommy cook/bake)</li>


    

<li>He must have shorter legs or something, because he fits his age in tops when it comes to sizing but his bottoms are behind a bit.</li>


</ul>


I’m amazed at how fast our children is growing up, now that we all have slightly different routines and that they are no longer babies.]]>

But I probably would order from <a href="https://www.facebook.com/bakehurry/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bake-Hurry</a> again – especially if they had a promo since dairy-free and nut-free baked treats are hard to come by! When local hipster cafes and bakeries start charging an upwards of $4 for a square brownie, a box of 24 decently sized pieces of freshly baked custom brownies for $30 (or $20 for first time customers) becomes a great price and I like being able to support our local small businesses. The way they are boxed makes them look homemade, but they do come from a rented commercial kitchen (Courtyard Kitchens), in the same building as <a href="https://www.fourall.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Four All Ice Cream</a> in Kitchener. I should have frozen some had I done some pricing research since they should last up to a month in the freezer or a week in the fridge. They do have a nice chocolately crunch on the outside with a soft chew on the inside, just as advertised, and just the way I like my freshly baked cookies. I’m glad I asked for reduced sugar because I found it sufficiently sweet – the regular version would probably have been too sweet for me. A friend commented on the texture, that it reminded her of mooncake, but perhaps that is because it is the dairy-free version?
Same day (from order to) delivery is another win in my books, as it’s perfect for those cravings (for dessert, a sweet bite, or those midnight munchies – like right now) and last minute meal prep and I don’t have to go out to get them, especially if I don’t want to lug my kids around with me.]]>		</p>

		<p>				they’ve banned this ingredient now, at least in US, which is a good start, and that Bath & Body Works has “gentle foaming hand soap” now in its place. And, I started to shift towards more natural products, preferring unscented or <a href="http://her.happyhippos.ca/2017/01/essential-oils-when-less-is-more/">scented with essential oils</a> over added (synthetic) fragrance or parfums.
Eventually, I quit buying from Bath & Body Works and saved the last few bottles once they were empties and have used my own foaming soap since, which is probably a more frugal and more environmentally-friendly alternative. [ref] Glass or stainless steel dispensers is probably best, but I’ve used plastic without any problems so far (I did toss one when something looked off).[/ref] Interested in making your own?


</p><h3>Easy as 1-2-3:</h3>


You can follow the many recipes on Google but here’s my version:


<ol><li><b>Get some liquid castile soap</b> (<a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/14-uses-for-dr-bronners-soaps-2013-11">like Dr. Bronner’s</a>) – the just-under 1L bottles of castile concentrate go on sale sometimes for under $15. If you want, you can buy unscented or scented and skip adding fragrance in later. [ref] just be careful that you don’t get any of it undiluted in your eye or your face, especially the peppermint one, as it is super concentrated and your eyes will burn and your skin will tingle for a long while – trust me on this one, I know from experience[/ref]</li>


    

<li><b>Add some soap</b> into an empty foaming dispenser</li>


    

<li><b>Add water</b> –  I do 1/4 or less of soap and the rest with water. You can experiment with a ratio you like by washing your hands and feeling how clean it is after.</li>


</ol><b>Pro tip:</b> I don’t actually fill up the entire bottle; I rather make the foaming soap solution more frequently to lower chances of having any bacterial growth / residue in a bottle that sits unused. Note that if it sits in a cool area, it may cloud over, which is fine.


<h4>Optional:</h4>




<ul><li>Use distilled water instead of tap, as I’ve read that it may keep bacteria and floaties (precipitate as my friend calls it) at bay. I’ve just used filtered and haven’t run into any trouble since I switched from tap.</li>


    

<li>For your own custom blend or to add a nice scent, add only <a href="http://her.happyhippos.ca/2017/01/essential-oils-when-less-is-more/">a </a><b><a href="http://her.happyhippos.ca/2017/01/essential-oils-when-less-is-more/">few</a></b><a href="http://her.happyhippos.ca/2017/01/essential-oils-when-less-is-more/"> drops of essential oils</a> (do you research and avoid the ones that may have a risk if you have little ones in your household: rosemary, peppermint, eucalyptus are at the top of my mind to avoid); sweet orange (be careful as acid may react with plastic in the bottles; I haven’t had that problem) and lavender may be good choices to start.</li>


    

<li>Add a few drops of Vitamin E for moisturizing and to possibly help with extending its shelf life, but Dr. Bronner’s has tocopherol as an ingredient which some labels will also say Vitamin E as a preservative.</li>


</ul><hr>
On the featured image: Since I don’t have time to make my bottles fancy with custom labels to show off, perhaps a DIY faucet extender hack will go well with DIY foaming soap? :P]]>

Flying from and to a small(er) airports (IAG, SFB, PIE) in the American side meant less wait at security and check-in, car-rental pickup and drop-off points[ref] – the car rental pick-up in Sanford was empty as well, which meant no waiting and a lot of vehicles to choose from – so we got to use a fancier Camry SE, not your typical granny Camrys of the past[/ref], and at customs. We even had the luxury of stopping at Wegmans and Trader Joe’s to stock up on goods without weighing down our luggage because had our car, which ended up being parked at a nearby hotel (which was jogging / walking distance). The Best Western at Niagara Falls, NY was only $80 for a night’s stay, free parking while we were away, and breakfast!


</p><h3>Activities</h3>




<ul><li><strong>Crayola Experience: </strong>our kids (and I did too) had a blast checking out the different activity stations and playing on the indoor play structure. The mall that it’s attached to is quite nice too, so you can get some shopping in, or have your kids play in the free play area inside the mall too. Just please make sure they wash their hands properly before eating [ref] Parent fail here as we just gave them hand sanitizer and our oldest somehow managed to get a stomach flu within that day – poor car seat. She was still feeling unwell the next day or so, so much so that she asked to fly home and not stay in the caboose a couple of times the following day[/ref].


<ul><li>Keep an eye out for <a href="http://www.crayolaexperience.com/orlando/plan-your-visit/special-offers.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">current offers</a>: If you’re staying in the Orlando for an extended time and the weather forecast isn’t great, you can consider buying an annual pass, as it’s only a few dollars more than the general admission. Other offers include free admission within 7 days of your birthday, a 4-person annual pass for $100 or 3 for $80 (valid for 13 months if you buy before the end of this year), 50% off after 5pm, and<a href="http://www.crayolaexperience.com/orlando/teachers.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> free admission for teachers with 50% off for their immediate families</a>. We didn’t fit the criteria for either of those, so we found the least expensive option from Costco.com at $16.99 for anyone 3 years old or older.</li>


</ul></li>


    

<li><strong><a href="https://www.kennedyspacecenter.com/launches-and-events/events-calendar?pageindex=1&categories=Rocket%20Launches" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Watch a rocket launch</a></strong>, if it’s during the time you’re there. A rocket launch was scheduled to happen during our week there but it got postponed twice! You can also <a href="http://www.floridatoday.com/story/tech/science/space/2017/03/29/10-great-places-watch-rocket-launch/99730718/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">watch it at a distance for free</a> (especially if your young child isn’t going to find going to the Kennedy Space Center interesting)</li>


</ul><h4>Beyond Orlando</h4>




<ul><li><strong>Beaches</strong>:


<ul><li><strong>Cocoa Beach</strong>, where Kennedy Space Center is located a little over an hour away from the Disney / Orlando area, and has a sandy beach front with a pier that you can walk along (have not visited as the rocket launch we had planned on seeing was postponed)</li>


    

<li><strong>Clearwater Beach and St. Pete’s Beach</strong>, both in the same area, a little over an hour away from Disney / Orlando area the other direction is ranked #3 and #4 respectively as the top beaches in the US on TripAdvisor. I was a little disappointed that we missed seeing either of them, but our littlest was sick that day and the temperature and dropped down to a chilly 12C; we spent more time in our caboose and went to a nearby playground instead, which the kids had an equally good time</li>


    

<li>If you don’t want to go as far but still want to play in the water and your resort hotel doesn’t have a kid-friendly pool, you can check out <a href="https://orlandoonthecheap.com/cool-off-orlando-splash-pad-parks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">nearby splash pad</a>s (free or nominal charge)</li>


</ul></li>


</ul><h3>Eats</h3>


Finding good eats seemed easier in St. Petersburg than in Orlando, but maybe I just didn’t know where to look, but we did have a few favourites:


<ul><li><strong>Sweet Tomatoes: </strong>soup and salad buffet bar with finger-friendly food ($12 adults, much less for kids, and family pricing that comes with a drink). The salad area, soups, and bread areas had a lot of vegan (thus dairy-free) options and the items that had nuts or seeds in it were labelled; there was even vegan butter (tasted great)! When I had a question, there was also a manager that could check their books or boxes for an ingredient list so I felt safe eating there. The kids ate so much, and the adults liked it so much that we ended up visiting twice. You might even be able to <a href="https://www.retailmenot.com/view/sweettomatoes.com?c=9460138" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">find a coupon to use in-store online</a>.</li>


    

<li><a href="https://www.tripadvisor.ca/Restaurant_Review-g34515-d903337-Reviews-Q_Kenan_Restaurant-Orlando_Florida.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Q’Kenans </a>– Venezuelan cuisine, #6 of almost 3000 restaurants in the Orlando area on TripAdvisor: casual, family-friendly dining space, and the (owner? manager?) was great at answering questions. We came on a friend’s recommendation, which I’m glad for as it’s not a place that I would have gone into based on what it looks like from the parking lot (probably because it reminds me of the soup and sandwich restaurants we had). By the end of our meal, we had a plate of lightly batter calamari with their house sauce and I had an empanada and arepa while j.w chose some homemade cheese dish with a rice-based drink similar to horchata and it only came to $32. I might have tried their patacon plantain sandwich if I hadn’t had one for lunch at a Cuban place days before. Had I known that they have <a href="https://www.groupon.com/biz/orlando/qkeenan" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a promo on Groupon</a>, I may have purchased from there first.</li>


    

<li><strong>World’s largest McDonald’s: </strong>the menu has some unusual items like pizza, pasta, belgium waffles, croque monsieur, and cheesecake. I didn’t try much there as they couldn’t tell me much about the ingredients in the items that were not listed online (because it was a unique McDonald’s). Perfect for kids to expend their energy on a cooler or wet day, as there is free two-story play structure and an area with priced arcade and midway games. The under 3 play area is very small though, and I would say if you have a mobile toddler, they would get bored and try to play in the main play structure which is supposedly for 4-12 years of age.</li>


    

<li>Other notes:


<ul><li>Sanaa at Disney’s Animal Kingdom is on the higher end (Disney pricing, I suppose) and the food only okay, but you’re essentially paying to see animals walk up to the windows and see African safari type animals in the viewing area. Free parking for diners.</li>


    

<li>If you’re at Disney Springs (which sells unique Disney wear at Uniqlo), the Polite Pig also offers some good southern BBQ flavour at expected Disney prices, and can answer my allergy-geared questions – the sides (when you order 3) are the same prices as the sides we’re accustomed to paying; I really enjoyed the BBQ cauliflower and crispy brussel sprouts glazed in whiskey-caramel (though they may have subbed the caramel for me), and the mac&cheese side was a portion big enough for our oldest as a main.</li>


</ul></li>


</ul><h4>Beyond Orlando</h4>




<ul><li><a href="http://www.crispycajunclearwater.com/menu.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Crispy Cajun in Clearwater</a>: the $10ish jambalaya, one of the three top sellers, was delicious and was excellent comfort food for the cold weather we had that weekend and worth its portion in onions – quite spicy even on mild; it was large enough to feed two. We wanted to go back the next day to try their most-popular sale, fried chicken (over a thousand pounds sold in a week), but they were closed on Sundays, sadly. The lady told me that nothing is fried with milk in it (intentionally as she is aware that so much batter is often buttermilk based or some other milk ingredient) so I was one happy eater. She also offered to make some grilled Cajun fish (I changed it from 2 piece to 1 because of her poor appetite due to her stomach flu) served with mashed potatoes (they found the gravy peppery) and only charged us $3! I would’ve also been interested in trying the fried gizzards and hush puppies (3 for $1.50)</li>


    

<li><a href="https://www.yelp.ca/biz/big-island-poke-tampa" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Big Island Poke in Tampa</a>: it’s just a drive-through place – kind of like the coffee drive-thru places I’ve seen in other cities, but it serves poke bowls, acai bowls, and smoothies, *almost* just like they do in Hawaii. Their fish pieces are decent in size and the toppings were quite fresh, with reasonable pricing; I topped up my meal with a poke bowl because I wasn’t full from Ray’s. I would choose a make-your-own poke bowl next time instead of a suggested one.</li>


    

<li><a href="https://www.yelp.ca/biz/big-island-poke-tampa" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Big Ray’s Fish Camp in Tampa</a>: has fresh-tasting fish (like grouper) and interesting dessert choices like fried key-lime pie, conch fritters, and grouper cheeks. However, I couldn’t try much of their menu as they use milk ingredients/buttermilk in their batter (which also appears in their fryers) so I was limited to a grilled grouper over some greens.</li>

<strong>Highlights:</strong> Minimal diaper duty – yay, daddy duty!, local food (poke, ahi tuna, fish tacos, gelato / sorbeto in my case), super nice weather, walking distance to beautiful beach sunsets, laid-back vacationing – didn’t feel like our itinerary was jam-packed, even though we had activities every day, and because time change happened while we were gone, we had one less hour to adjust to coming back.
<strong>Low lights:</strong> Lost luggage – it’s material but annoying that we lost our epipen, 2lbs of Kona coffee, a brand new jump starter battery pack, and a family photo in a photo frame with two bonus prints from Maui Ocean Center (because it was their first day and they were still testing the waters); I was feeling so smug about being packed for our next trip too. More about that in the next section.
As my family was sick leading up to the trip, I finally got sick on the first day or two of the trip; what was nice that even though I felt perpetually cold inside because I was fighting a fever, I just had to sit outside for an hour or two to warm up. By the second day, I decided to buy some generic cold+flu medication and that helped tremendously.


</p><hr><h3>Flights</h3>


One downside is that Maui is very far – we chose to board three planes going there, and two coming back. For those on the West Coast, it makes sense, whereas we probably would fare better in the Caribbean – and maybe it was the time of the year, but the waves were a little too much for the little ones to enjoy. Thankfully, kids were great on the plane; while we had very little sleep, even on a red-eye flight, there were no major crying episodes. Because we stopped over at YVR on our way back, the rest of my family met us there for a quick catch-up over a short breakfast; it was extremely nice to be able to see them! For future reference, it takes about 1.5 hours to walk from the gate in Canada through security and customs to the US gate (and a pee break) with young children; we just made it for boarding.
Strangely enough, after we boarded early and clipped in the car seats, a couple of passengers came on and told us that we had their seats. Sure enough, their boarding passes had the same seats that we did! As I went to try to sort it out with the flight attendants, we discovered that other seats and passengers had the same problem; they called it “seat tubing” (or something like that?!) but I couldn’t find what the problem was on Google. Thankfully, everyone ended up being seated in a seat, and we didn’t have to move.

On our way back, at the luggage drop-off, the attendant offered to check-in a carry-on for us for free, so we took her up on the offer, as it meant that we didn’t have to carry it around with us in YVR. At YVR, the WJ folks were so nice to offer us a ride on a golf cart so that we didn’t have to walk the long walk from the gate to customs.  At customs, the kind security person just waved us over to the flight crew line and we bypassed 9 flights of passengers, just like that! I don’t know if we would’ve been able to sit down and have breakfast with my family otherwise; we only had about 45 minutes to do that even with the expedited process because our flight departed late.
Because it was a carry-on, we had left some of the more important items in that suitcase (like our epipen) and didn’t have a “this belongs to” tag on it. Somehow, in our rush to pick up our luggage at YYZ, we forgot about it, and didn’t think about it until we got to our Toronto home. But, the airline had not seen it when we called, so somehow it is still missing. WestJet has graciously offered to settle with the amount we claimed or give us a little extra in WJ credits!


<hr><h3>Food</h3>


Memorable highlights:


<ul><li>Costco sold unique items like poke, sashimi (ahi and marlin), wild ahi and moonfish steaks, Japanese-style boxed and frozen mochi, coconut rolls, Kona and other Hawaiian coffee, local papaya</li>


</ul><h4>Sweet</h4>




<ul><li>Fruit stands on the side of the street:


<ul><li>Creamy, buttery, large <strong>avocadoes</strong> for $1</li>


    

<li><strong>Passionfruit</strong> –  2 for $1</li>


    

<li><strong>Miracle berry</strong>: makes everything sour taste like sour candy! A former co-worker told me about this, so when j.w saw them, I told him that 4 for $1 was worth trying, even if it was just for the novelty</li>


    

<li><strong>Starfruit</strong> – 2 for $1</li>


</ul></li>


    

<li><strong>Maui Gold Pineapple:</strong> it must have been at the end of its season because by the last day or two, it sold from over $1.49 /lb to $0.88/lb for all available pineapple, which were mostly Dole ones; they taste different from Dole.</li>


    

<li><strong>Candy apple bananas</strong>: native to Hawaii, they have a tinge of orange to them, are slightly firmer, and have a fruitier taste; you can bring this and pineapples back</li>


    

<li><strong>Banana bread: </strong>yes, surprisingly, market stand banana breads are very moist and tasty; some are even dairy and nut-free!</li>


    

<li><a href="https://www.hawaiimagazine.com/content/crazy-kulolo-kauais-dessert-staple" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Kulolo</strong></a>: a sweet dessert that reminds of baked nian gao (年糕), made of taro, coconut milk, and sugar (and original recipes call for ti, whatever that is; even the <a href="http://www.geniuskitchen.com/recipe/kulolo-hawaiian-pudding-162954" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">modern recipes for kulolo</a>  seem quite labour intensive!)</li>


    

<li><strong>Sorbetto</strong> at <a href="https://onogelatokihei.com/menu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ono Gelato</a>: so much choice! If you aren’t dairy-free, the gelato options looked incredible too. If you have an entertainment book, there’s even a BOGO free coupon. There was another gelato place that had less choice in N. Kihei, that had a sweet potato coconut milk based sorbetto that was delicious, but I prefered Ono.</li>


    

<li><strong>Shave ice</strong> at <a href="http://www.ululanishawaiianshaveice.com/">Ululani’s Hawaiian Shave Ice</a> – the <strong>mochi topping</strong> was so soft and chewy. I prefered this over Local Boys, as Ululani’s claims to use real fruit-based syrup but Local Boys uses artificial syrup, even though the one at Lahaina had excellent service; not only did the gal at Local Boys Lahaina give free samples for us (no buying expected), she even gave me half of her pitaya smoothie, because I had asked about it but that side of the store was closed.</li>


    

<li><strong>Pineapple beer. Pineapple wine.</strong> Good thing neither of them got lost.</li>


    

<li><a href="https://www.vitacoco.com/products/coconutmilk/original" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Coconut milk beverage:</a> unsweetened and very creamy delicious, especially the Vita Coco brand; I can’t find it here it seems</li>


    

<li>Wow Wow Hawaiian Lemonades has freshly squeezed lemonade with toppings and other fruits (and entertainment book discounts and happy hour special pricing)<img class="wp-image-5991 size-full alignleft" src="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/37448161314_4356da751d_z.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="360" srcset="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/37448161314_4356da751d_z.jpg 640w,https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/37448161314_4356da751d_z-300x169.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px"></li>


</ul><h4>Savoury</h4>




<ul><li><strong>Fresh poke</strong> at the grocery store, Costco, fish restaurants; ranged from $12/lb to about $18. Fresh poke meant ahi tuna, marinated in a variety of sauces like shoyu, wasabi, spicy mayo; cheaper poke (and other fish variety) could be had but they were previously frozen</li>


    

<li><strong>Spam musubi:</strong> even the ones under the heat lamp at the grocery store tasted delicious. I had seen them on a prior trip but hadn’t tried it before. Shame that I couldn’t try deep-fried spam musubi at Da Kitchen (has dairy in it).</li>


    

<li><strong>Pork fried rice</strong> at <a href="http://kiheicaffe.com/menu.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kihei Cafe</a>: sadly, we didn’t get a chance for a repeat visit. There’s a kid-friendly room for families to sit and eat (and draw on tables) but it was a little chilly with the air-conditioning on, so we ended up moving to one of the outside patio tables.</li>


    

<li>Ahi (poke)-stuffed calamari at Cafe O’ Lei: such a casual sounding, punny name for a fancier restaurant!</li>


    

<li>We also liked Coconut’s Fish Cafe for their fish tacos, and everyday value – the Azeka location had better service, but the Kihei one had a lot more space (I’d prefer the service over space). You can ask me for my toss-away phone number for their points if you go, so you can take advantage of discounts and freebies.</li>


</ul><hr><h3>Beaches</h3>


I’ve discovered that you can be a beach person without needing to play or wade or splash in the water; sitting on the sand is just as nice. Perhaps it was the time of the year, but almost every beach on the map had waves that were quite strong, especially for the kiddies to play in.
[embed]https://flic.kr/p/GBiyBt[/embed]
Comments on the beaches we visited, with my favourite at the top:


<ul><li><a href="https://goo.gl/maps/WehMHhAttm32" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Unnamed “secret” beach</a>: walking distance away from where we stayed – there was a walking trail that led to it from the road (no parking). The rocks broke the waves and it was a nice quiet due to the secluded spot; this was easily my favorite spot for the kids and to watch sunsets.</li>


    

<li><a href="http://mauiguidebook.com/beaches/baby-beach/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Baby Beach</a>, not the one in Lahaina, but the one by Paia: a wall of rocks break the waves so that they don’t crash onto the shoreline. This also allows for some shallow swimming and snorkeling opportunities to see turtles. Unfortunately, a few beach visitors did not heed the dogs-must-be-leashed rule and our kids were kissed by two really hyper (likely young) and free-roaming dogs (the owners were not in sight when they came up to us), and that pretty much ruined that visit for them. At least the owners leashed them up after this incident.</li>


    

<li>Charley Young Beach: if you walk it, you can walk to Kamaole I, II, III from Charlie Young; it’s less busy than Kamaole beaches, but all are good spot for sunsets</li>


    

<li>Kamaole III beach advertises a park playground but it’s really only a set of swings; the better playground is at Kalama Park, which is next to Cove Beach, a seemingly popular spot for SUP and surfers.</li>


    

<li>Kapalua Bay Beach: we were looking for Napili Beach but couldn’t find the signs for them, so we found this one instead. I wouldn’t recommend it as it had limited parking, lots of people, and deep fryer smells like onion rings wafting in our direction. However there was plenty of shade to sit under.</li>


    

<li><a href="http://mauiguidebook.com/beaches/makena-big-beach-oneloa/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Makena Beach</a>: a very long beach – it takes a while to walk from one parking entrance to another along the beach. It was so windy there that our beach umbrellas blew away; this was where a local told us that the current was stronger at this time of the year – something to do with leeward / windward tradewinds? [Ed. I hadn’t read the comments about this beach until now, but it seems the strong currents are normal here]</li>


    

<li>Kenolio Beach: conveniently located across the street from Ulanani’s, so if you go near sunset, you can grab a shave ice before it closes and then enjoy the sunset or walk across to look for turtles along the pier (and stay dry while at it!) during the day. Next time, I hope to be able to join this group to go <a href="http://www.kiheicanoeclub.com/guest16.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">paddling on their outrigger canoes</a>![embed]https://flic.kr/p/21x8pTd[/embed]</li>


</ul><hr><h3>Beautiful Drives</h3>


These drives aren’t necessarily for the faint of heart, but if you go slow, drive carefully and be alert, the breath-taking scenes make it worthwhile. If you attempt any of these, I would recommend driving during daylight hours as there are no street lights, minimal guard rails, and little to no shoulder; in fact, you might have to share a lane with oncoming traffic.
In order of perceived danger (considering factors like narrow lanes, tight turns, unpaved roads, proximity to the cliff, cattle crossing, weather) where the top is probably the safest:


<ol><li>

<strong>Haleakala Highway</strong> to the volcano’s summit (10,023 feet says the sign): the roads look maintained, relatively wide and has reflectors, but here are some things to watch out for – especially if you’re driving up for sunrise or driving down after sunset:


<ul><li>Cattle crossing: cows just wander onto the road</li>


    

<li>Weather changes from warm at the base to super windy and cold near the top (e.g. from 26C to 9C); it could also change from sunshine to rain</li>


    

<li>Fog (or when you’re driving through the clouds): when it’s bad, you can barely see anything in front of you; it also just randomly shows up even if it’s clear as day at the top or at the base</li>


    

<li>Roll down the windows, open the vents when you see forest trees around you, and you’ll be able to take in the fresh eucalyptus smell; mmm, breathe it in!</li>


</ul>


Even if you don’t go during sunrise or sunset, you will feel like <a href="https://flic.kr/p/ZqQmXE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">you’ve landed on Mars</a> once you get to the top!</li>

<strong>Pi’lani Highway:</strong> otherwise known as <a href="http://mauiguidebook.com/adventures/haleakala-backside-kipahulu-to-ulupalakua/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">backside of Road to Hana/Haleakala</a>. The recorded path on the Google Timeline map doesn’t look as bad as the one above, but it is known for its narrow, and unpaved and uneven roads (single to the point of needing to back up if you meet oncoming traffic), tight turns, and risk of landslides and washed out (resulting in closed) roads in wet weather; thus, I would recommend not taking this route if it has rained at all. Most recommend taking it clockwise so you are not driving on the side of the cliff. At one point, if you are driving slowly enough and then stop on the side and walk over, you can actually see an abandoned vehicle (I keep thinking it’s a white jeep) that has crashed and fallen off the cliff. At the slowest point, it took us almost 2 hours just to drive 37 kms (with a few stops but quite minimal since we were trying to get out of there before dark and catch up to the other car). The drive reminded at times of the California coast, the Cabot trail in the Maritimes, and what I’d imagine coastal drives in Europe might be like.

<strong>North of West Maui</strong>: After going through Pi’ilani and <a href="http://mauiguidebook.com/adventures/west-mauis-north-shore-kapalua-to-wailuku/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reading the reviews and comments about this route</a>, j.w decided it wasn’t worth it, so we skipped it. The other car was going to attempt it but opted to let their kids play at local beaches instead on the day we went up Haleakala. However, we did drive the part from Lahaina to Nakaele Blowhole before we did Hana, which was probably one of my favourite activities on this trip as I got some hiking in (though j.w got the worse of it as he took one in arms, and one in a backpack hiking carrier UP the rocks) and we saw the <a href="https://flic.kr/p/ZjLm5x">blowhole in action</a> (sadly, I can’t say the same at Waianapanapa State Park as all we saw was the sign that day); I didn’t dare to go too close as I was paranoid about being sucked in – due to the stories circulating online. The drive, though winding at times, didn’t feel so bad, so I’m going to assume that it gets bad after the blowhole.</li>


</ol><hr><h3>Worth mentioning</h3>




<ul><li>Maui goes all out on Hallowe’en: so many costumed characters and almost every place has a treat for the kids. Who needs to go neighbourhood trick o’ treating when you can head to a local mall; you even get treats from restaurants too…</li>


    

<li>Wild roosters and chickens seem to roam free everywhere</li>


    

<li>You can watch hula dancing by keiki (kids) for free (put on by the hula dancing school) at the Cannery Mall</li>


    

<li>Hawaii state law prohibits touching turtles, so leave them alone if you see them with you in the water!</li>


    

<li>Whale watching: we tried twice without any luck – since whale spotting was guaranteed – once from Maui Ocean Center docks and the other from Lahaina. 3 out of 4 adults in our party got a bit queasy. However, we did spot spinner dolphins (too many to count) on the trip out of Lahaina and they were so social and entertaining to watch![embed]https://flic.kr/p/22ueXQn[/embed]</li>

<li>Ending the year as a stay-at-home mom and transitioning to a working mom in 2018!</li>





Being a stay-at-home mom was God’s gift: I see it as being paid to leave at the end of my first maternity leave. This upcoming job? Also God’s gift – here’s why:


<ul><li>I had not been actively applying for jobs [ref]I had actually resigned to giving up my career (I’ve labelled it “career suicide”) and had expected to stay at home until the youngest was at school at minimum, and then finding part-time or casual work during school hours, probably in a different field[/ref]. Once or twice a year, I get asked and consider going back to work but I’ve always declined due to the number of hours (I didn’t want a 40 hour work week; I want to be home when the kids are off school) but the past few months have been a perfect set-up for this…</li>


    

<li>I had not been actively applying for jobs. Yet, in the spring, a friend asked me if I was interested in doing consulting work for them; it was ideal: part-time hours, mostly at night after kids’ bedtimes, and my in-laws gave us childcare support during the few on-site visits! Turns out, recent work became relevant work.</li>


    

<li>When our oldest started school, our youngest lost his playing companion and he suddenly demanded more of my attention (ie. companionship); he also wanted to go out, just like his sister did. So, I turned to the <a href="https://www.sapcrc.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Parent-Child Resource Center at our local Salvation Army</a>, and enrolled in programs three days a week, so that he would have something to do in the mornings. They were (are) amazing: my in-laws’ church nursery couldn’t calm him down but they did within a short time on the first day, though it took him 3 weeks to stop crying at drop-off and pick-up. Now, even though he initially protests, I know he can be happy in someone else’s care.</li>


    

<li>Timing: I have been picking up a friend’s daughter from Montessori and dropping her off at the sitter once a week, but it just happens that the mom’s schedule is changing in January, so I don’t have to do that anymore.</li>


    

<li>I had not been actively applying for jobs. Somehow, between Maui to Orlando (within a month), I was offered a job.</li>


    

<li>I had not been actively applying for jobs. I hadn’t interviewed for at least 7 years, so I’m not exactly well-practised. I went through a few rounds of interviews, and by the second round, I actually expected to walk away for good, as my interview ended early; I felt that I could have given better answers (instead of what I felt were vague) and I did not complete a 20-minute design challenge in time or thoroughly (what happened to navigation?!). I also didn’t have a portfolio ready until interviews started!</li>


    

<li>I had not been actively applying for jobs. Yet, this company had an opening for a permanent position (advertised) – doing what I enjoy – at reduced hours (unadvertised), which lets me get off in time to pick up the kids from school – how awesome is that?!</li>


    

<li>Interesting tidbit: my first job was at a GIS company with under 50 employees; this job is at a GIS company with about the same number.</li>


</ul>


We just need to find childcare now, but if God has provided all of this, I’m certain we will be in good hands!]]>

				Now that we’re into an almost-established routine with our oldest in junior kindergarten, it’s not as confusing for me, as the parent. Maybe it’s just our school, but it seems like they just <em>assume</em> that we know what to do or where to go, so this is a shortlist of what I wish I knew before she started or what I wish the school had communicated – maybe it’ll help me again in a few years’ time:


<h3>Kindergarten</h3>


<ul><li><a href="http://www.edu.gov.on.ca/kindergarten/whatelsedoineedtoknow.html">Kindergarten is not mandatory in Ontario</a>, and if your kid is not 6 years old by the time kids born in the same year start Grade 1, <a href="https://beta.theglobeandmail.com/news/toronto/toronto-kindergarten-late-birthdays/article34229793/?ref=http://www.theglobeandmail.com&" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">you may opt to send him a year later</a>. Most people send their kids into the education system when between 3 to 4 years old for junior kindergarten and they go for a full day (~6.5 hours) without a nap time (which is fine – I recall just lying on gym mats looking up at the flourescent lights in the ceiling anyway during my half day of kindergarten).</li></ul><figure class="wp-block-image alignright wp-image-5884 size-medium"><img src="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/firstday-e1506485761643-300x225.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-5884" srcset="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/firstday-e1506485761643-300x225.jpg 300w,https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/firstday-e1506485761643-768x576.jpg 768w,https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/firstday-e1506485761643-1024x768.jpg 1024w,https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/firstday-e1506485761643-1568x1175.jpg 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"><figcaption> My first day of junior kindergarten too (as a parent of a JKer)!</figcaption></figure><ul><li>Because kindergarten is not mandatory, you can choose to send your child part-time but of course, the educators will try to encourage you to follow everyone else.  If you plan to do modified schedule: <strong>notify the principal in advance before the start of the school year. </strong><em><strong>On orientation day, after discussing this with the teaching staff and getting their support, the office administrator asked me why I didn’t do it before September, but how was I supposed to know?</strong></em> </li></ul><ul><li>Your child’s backpack should be able to fit something that is 8.5×11″ in size – but parents don’t see this requirement until the first week of school when you get the classroom orientation package, and by then many would have already bought a backpack! </li></ul><ul><li>You’re supposed to provide a pair of indoor shoes for your child – <strong>pro-tip</strong>: if it’s a pair of running shoes or can be gym-ready, then you don’t need a second one for gym time </li></ul><ul><li>Even though you may have just met the teacher, a school-wide meet-the-teacher day happens two days after, and you’re welcome for another visit. There is no other information provided on what to expect at meet-the-teacher day; such as, is it drop-in? do you get to have 1:1 time? does the teacher share more about the daily classroom schedule?</li></ul><h3>Missed time</h3>


<p>I’m not sure why this isn’t communicated, but I had to ask what the policy/process was in regards to missing school:</p>


<ul><li>If your child is only attending part-time on a regular basis, you will need to complete a form stating which morning or afternoons that she will be absent</li><li>If your child will be away for more than 5 days (planned), you need to complete a form excusing him or her from school, and state the reason [ref]I wonder how many people make up reasons, and if they even read the reasons[/ref]. If the child is away for more than 15 consecutive days without prior approval and alternate arrangements, the school will unregister him from the system.</li><li>If your child is late, you need to go to the office to sign in the student to get a late slip, and you need to sign the child out if she needs to leave early.</li></ul><h3>Portals of Communication</h3>


<ul><li>I don’t like the word portal when it comes to web systems, but I guess that’s what they are: there is too many remember how to get there and how to get in (no SSO or cross-linking): the student library portal, the parent/school portal, the photo day portal, the french immersion / student registration portal, scholastic payments page, the immunization reporting site, the school website for announcements – in addition to announcements in the parent/school portal …I’m sure I’ve forgotten others.</li><li>The school portal makes no sense to me –
</li></ul><figure class="wp-block-image alignright"><a href="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/calendar.png"><img src="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/calendar-300x120.png" alt="School-Day" class="wp-image-5883" srcset="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/calendar-300x120.png 300w,https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/calendar-768x307.png 768w,https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/calendar-1024x410.png 1024w,https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/calendar.png 1490w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></a><figcaption> The default calendar is empty. What might not be immediately obvious, is that you have to select from the drop-down to see your class or school calendar.</figcaption></figure><p>why is there even a classroom calendar section that isn’t even used? Instead, the teacher opts to upload a PDF file of each month’s calendar. And what’s the difference between Events (which shows none when you click on it) and the School Calendar (ignore the bug for the moment, that when you click School Calendar, the Events category is selected)? And why, does the School Calendar have Phys Ed days listed but it differs from her class?
Her teacher also uses the School Files area to upload a snapshot of what they are learning once every two weeks, but other teachers use other apps to share. I wish there was a more consistent system so that parents know what to expect throughout their kids’ journey in one school.
</p>


<p>…I guess I should have seen this coming, since they invited pre-JKers to check out the library last school year, but they neglected to mention that they close two weeks before school ends, and that the librarian isn’t always there, so you might not be able to sign anything out even if you visit – and no one will take your pre-JKer on a tour.</p>


<hr class="wp-block-separator"><p><strong>Side note:</strong> I didn’t think the pizza day/hot dog day/fudgsicle cycle would repeat itself! I remember feeling left out when everyone else’s parents decided that a once-a-month hotdog or a pizza slice with chocolate/white milk was a fine lunch for their kids (25 cents-$1.5 subsidized), but my parents continued to send their regular (sandwich) lunches. I hope my child is stronger than I was, and will be okay that I neither will buy her a pizza slice for $1.50 4 weeks in a row, nor buy her a cookie with it. Maybe as consolation, I should send her some free pizza and homemade cookies. This is also the case for Scholastic orders – all these kids got cool books but my name was rarely ever called to get new books to take home…</p>
