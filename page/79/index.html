		<p>				mid-story:</p>




<p>looking into the restaurant, i see this guy friend of mine and an older woman (w gray hair). i entered the restaurant and joined them in the both, taking the bench opposite them. i soon discovered, to utter shock, that my friend had fallen for her. i couldn’t believe my eyes!</p>




<p>shortly after, we left and headed someplace, where there was a shared bathroom amongst some people. eunice went in and dumped some crap into the shower stall, but as she closed the shower curtain, she heard someone coming in from the other side, so she quickly ran out via the other door. the other girl entered as was about to take a shower, but when she opened the shower curtain, she discovered to her, horror, what someone else had left behind.</p>




<p>eunice, eventually returned to brush her teeth. at first, wanting to be oblivious to knowing what happened, she just ignored the girls questions. she soon felt guilty, and proceeded to explain that she panicked and ran when she heard someone come in, when in fact, she wanted to wash it down the drain to begin with.</p>




<p>as that issue was resolved, we went to a different room and i saw a pet snake (not a garden snake, but one that was round and big). as i went to take a look at it, it lashed out and bit the palm of my hand! normally, the snake was harmless as it was quite tame, but boy, did it ever hurt. i had bite marks where the skin broke. it did that twice before i realised that someone didn’t feed it properly and it was really hungry so it just ate anything within its reach.</p>




<p>i woke up with black marks on my fingers, but i don’t know why.</p>

Wow, one month has sure gone by fast. The first month of school has come and gone, which also marks me being away from Ontario for almost that long…at the rate my mind wanders back, it often feels like i haven’t beeen gone for long, but during other times, it feels like eternity. I think I selfishly cling onto a few memories and people because I fear that I may forget in time…Jasy’s words haunt me, “Don’t forget like <i>him</i>“. Sometimes, I *don’t* want to remember, because it takes me away from the present…take worship for example. Every time I sing a song now that I’ve learnt in Waterloo, it brings me back; as a result, I get distracted and lose my focus O_o. I think I never really felt the effects of moving away in first year because in my naivity, there was no finality; I had assumed that I would come back to the same people that I knew and grew up with, neglecting to realise that distance and time would mean change – in friendships, even in their values and faith – sometimes good, other times not so good…
</p>



<p>
For once, I’m really happy that I’m not in Waterloo because the past week has been awesome, in terms of weather. There hasn’t been any snow (unlike elsewhere :p), and temperatures have been averaging 19-21C near the water (and even 30C inland!). I’m still walking about in shorts and T’s (more T’s less shorts) and there hasn’t been much rain so it’s been keeping me in good spirits…’cept when I wake up now, the sun hasn’t risen yet so it makes me incredibly sleepy.
</p>



<p>
As I bus to school on the “UBC Special Non-Stop” route every Tues and Thurs, I notice that many students aren’t earlybirds in the least. Minus the bus’ mechanics and engine noise, the bus is deathly quiet in the mornings…>95% of the people are just quietly reading/studying, daydreaming, or sleeping. Closer to late afternoon, early evening, however, the bus is buzzing with noise and chatter: friends catching up on each other lives, people chatting on their cells…still I am able to sleep =).
</p>



<p>
This week, a group of us (4) are starting to play a weekly night of badminton and meeting for prayer/sharing time afterwards, which reminds me of something that I thought about last night. When a friend asked me if I had any prayer requests, the first thing that I wanted to say, was to pray for so-and-so and for all these other things, but I momentarily paused and was reminded that I often forget to pray for my own needs — I think I need to work on getting a good balance of both =)

<p>at noon, my alarm woke me up from another night of dreams and soreness. from 12:00-12:15, and in my hunger, i was involved in a race to win. i’m surprised that i didn’t get any indigestion:</p>


<font color="maroon">


<p>three of us girls were lined up at the edge of a shallow pool. the goal of the race was to finish as much chocolate as possible while swimming across the length of the small pool. </p>




<p>to get into position, we jumped off the ledge and landed in the pool. because i didn’t really know how to swim, i landed quite hard and from the shock of jumping in, i just kinda sunk, until the girl to the left of me yanked me to the surface. luckily the water only went up to my chin when i stood up on my toes.</p>




<p>we then climbed a ladder to the top of the pool and started to open the wrapped candy bars and stuff into our mouths, as much chocolate as possible. the goal of the race was to finish 5g of chocolate within the given period of time and swim as many lengths as possible.</p>




<p>5 grams of chocolate turned out to be a lot. as the race started, i took as much chocolate as i could and while chewing, i jumped back into the pool, pushed myself off the side of the pool w my feet, until i touched the other side of the pool w my feet and pushed myself back (see, the length of the pool was maybe only 3 body lengths).</p>




<p>by the time i reached back to the start, i had almost finished chewing and proceeded to climb back up the ladder and stuff my mouth w more chocolate before jumping back into the pool for more swimming. the girl on my right had previously unwrapped all her chocolate to save her time from unwrapping, but i just broke and unwrapped at each stop. to keep me from slowing down, i just closed my eyes and went by feel every time i was in the pool.</p>




<p>the timer went off before any of us finished 5g of chocolates, but i noticed that i was tied with the amount of chocolates that the girl on my left consumed.</p>




<p>the only way to figure who won, was the amt of times that we touched the other side of the pool. i was under the impression that i likely cheated because i didnt use my hands to touch the other side but rather my feet…but i wasn’t sure of the rules and figured she would’ve prolly won anyhow since she knew how to swim. as the chart went up, i noticed that i went a bit further (ie. # times greater) than she did, so i won! however, the girl to the right of me had a harder swim because her lane had less water (shallower)…we termed it the “darling” run..donno why tho =)…so she had an disadvantage.</p>

		<p>				It’s all fun and games…


</p><p>…until someone gets hurt. </p>




<p>we were each appointed positions. i had the gun and was up against two other teams. i didn’t like the pressure of holding the gun and being the hunter so i looked for a trade. pastor tim gladly volunteered to trade his position for mine. but, what was a code commander? i never did find out. at least, i was not the primary target anymore for once one team shot both the other team leaders, the game would be over.</p>




<p>as the game started, i wandered to different people inquiring if they knew what the code commander did. nobody knew. i bumped into an ex-housemate of mine (one whom i didn’t know for some odd reason). we left the game a bit by flying over them. as we chatted, she confessed that her aunt used my computer while i wasn’t there, which would explain why my e-mails got downloaded off my mail server.</p>




<p>i soon got tired and had to land, but we landed in a different zone. i saw some people, including bonnie tam, hiding under couches and blankets. because i was tired, i decided to do that. shortly after, someone peeks under the blanket to see who it was, but i dared not open my eyes as i was afraid that if i did, and it wasn’t my teammate, i’d be shot. i heard the voice whispering to his teamate and recognised him, so i opened my eyes and told him that i was still alive and in the game.</p>




<p>i looked around and realised that with everyone around this area, i’d be in great danger since i wouldn’t be able to avoid anything. i decided to get up and participate in the action. as i rounded the corner to approach the corridor, i saw another leader firing some shots as he identified one of the other leaders. not too soon after, i see nathan tee and his sidekick coming to attack me with a electric razor. nate’s role and tactic to ward people off from helping their leaders was to cut off the enemy’s hair. well he managed to trim some of my hair off, and the ends the touched it turned blonde, so i ended up with blonde tips.</p>




<p>i managed to briefly grab at the razor and turn it around and cut patches into nate’s head. eventually, i cornered nate and his partner up against a wall with one of my kicks and just held them there in a hold, while taunting that i hadn’t showered in 2 days, so they were smelling my very smelly feet. =) nate’s partner decided to try the tickling tactic to get me to release my hold, but i didn’t as i knew how to react to being tickled and hold in my bouts of giggles and urge to squirm.</p>




<p>all of us were momentarily distracted by the drunk teens who wandered onto the wooden balconey by climbing a set of rickety steps on an angled ladder. wondering what they were up to as they were trespassing onto private property, we hear a crack, and seconds later, see one of them fall along with the balconey floor. the rest of them quickly try to go back down, but one other teen gets caught on the steps, and as the balcony collapses, the ladder goes, with him on it. everyone around us bursts out in laughter, thinking that they deserved what was coming to them…</p>




<p>—</p>




<p>the phone rang. and it woke me up.</p>

yes, and give me a boy and a girl in that order. jk! =p
</p>



<p>
Actually, as I was nodding off at <a href="http://www.alphacanada.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">alpha</a> the other day, i heard Nicky Gumbel, the speaker, say “life is like a maze…” and that just brought back friday’s events into my mind.
</p>



<p>
</p><center><a href="http://www.cornfieldmaze.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a></center>




<p>
As we were aimlessly trying to find the exit of this maze in the dark, and many without flashlights, I noticed the silly things we did: passing by the same people over and over again, asking people, who were also lost, which way to go, and, walking in circles as we reached the same fork again and again. Sometimes, we even tried man-made shortcuts, that eventually led to nowhere. We spent at least two hours stuck in one corner of the maze, not even being able to complete the second maze. I kept saying that the weedier, more narrow paths were the path less travelled, which logically would probably mean that it was the wrong way–to the extent where Clark would whine at me to be quiet. Sticking to that theory, we eventually found the exit.
</p>



<p>
Yet, in contrast, Jesus says, in Matthew 7:13-14, “<i>Enter through the narrow gate. For wide is the gate and broad is the road that leads to destruction, and many enter through it. But small is the gate and narrow the road that leads to life, and only a few find it.</i>”
</p>



<p>
It occurred to me that life is somewhat like a labyrinth, a game. At each fork, there is a choice to be made that would eventually affect your direction in life. Because the path is narrow, many of us likely stumble around in the darkness, not really knowing the way — perhaps turning to people who are themselves lost or just hoping that what they’re doing is right. Until one day, Someone comes with a light to guide them and to keep them from straying off the path, which of course, begs the next question, don’t all paths lead to the same place? It would be nice wouldn’t it? But, I believe that like a maze, there is only one way out — albeit some paths may take longer than others — but there is only one exit. Jesus repeatedly teaches, that He is the only way, the truth, and the life (John 14:6). Seems discrimatory, eh? But, I guess that’s the way it is…at least for those willing to accept that. It’s somewhat like the Matrix too I guess — your eyes aren’t really opened until you swallow the blue pill.
</p>



<p>
p.s. I’ve found a use for my CS minor! I get to teach my brother how to do assignments in java =). I also attribute my logical skills to my CS background. Without it, I’d be a part of the 80% of the people who failed that challenging (yet fun) test that we all wrote as a part of the job  application process. God sure has funny plans sometimes =).

5:04 am on tues morning, the phone rings and jostles me from my dreams. i hear footsteps and voices outside by bedroom door. ignoring the familiar sounds of my parents hustling about, i hurriedly fall back asleep before my alarm signals another workday. in my rushing to get to work on time, i overhear my brother say, “what? is MY car okay?” apparently, the police had called wondering if our car was still in the driveway. well, i look outside, and to my dismay and confirmation, our grand caravan is indeed missing from the driveway! O_o. rumours have it that the van was involved in an accident that almost killed 3….and now, it’s a write-off…it’s so damaged that icbc has deemed it not worth repairing. sometimes, i wish that we’d move, especially after what’s happened in the past few years: 3 break-and-enters – once w 2 men (i saw the silohuettes), once w theft, and once w my brother sleeping during daylight hours, 4 attempts at lifting a vehicle – once the license plate, twice the lock,  and finally, once w success.

Looking out the small oval window of the plane that is above the clouds below, she sees the bright dipper as close as one can get with the naked eye. A few hours before, the same pair of eyes peers beyond her reflection in the glass and see the lights of the city. As the halo of the lights blurs past her gaze, the emotions overwelm her. Tears falls from her eyes as she blinks after pausing on each face and remembering them in her prayers. Fighting back her composure, she returns to her book and engrosses herself in the supernatural world where good and evil are at war and soon watches Bruce Almighty, a mortal who fails at being God.

Will I dance for You Jesus or in awe of You be still<br>
Will I stand in Your presence or to my knees will I fall<br>
Will I sing hallelujah, will I be able to speak at all<br>
I can only imagine<br></p>



<p>
I can only imagine<br>
When that day comes<br>
And I find myself<br>
Standing in the Son<br>
I can only imagine<br>
When all I will do<br>
Is forever<br>
Forever worship You<br>
I can only imagine<br></p>

		<p>				
This is one sure of a Labour Day weekend that I won’t forget. Or, at least hope not! Tho’, it was one crazy 3 days! My prof @ UBC kindly allowed me to take off a week even tho I won’t be there to troubleshoot any technical difficulties if anything occurs in the first 2 lectures (3rd and 5th). Thus, my desinated “vacation” spot was….Ontario…infamous for its SARS and the blackout! =). Actually, I had 3 reasons to go: 1) I already had a return ticket from my previous purchase; 2) to pack up my room and all my junk in ‘loo so that it would be mailable; and 3) to see my friends and say farewells (fair thee well) and goodbyes (God bless ye)…until the next time we meet again.
</p>



<p>
The weekend started at 4:00am PST on Friday morning when we had to get up and rush to the airport to get there in time for my 6:30am flight to Toronto, which arrived at 2pm EST. By the time I got to the airport, I looked in the trunk and to my horror, my whole courier-style knapsack, containing my photoID, money, camera, phone, etc. was left behind at the house! I freaked and started to do some mad prayers for a miracle–esp w security at YVZ’s airport. We didn’t have time to go home to retrieve it, so we managed to wake up my sister  to try to rush it out to give it to me (note that it takes at least 1/2 hr to get to the airport from my house and by that time, it was well beyond 5:30 am). As the line of people decreased, my position in the queue slowly moved towards the front. Finally, when it was my turn, she asked me some question to which I replied, “Um, I left my wallet at home and I have no photoID. My sister is on her way to bring it to me, but I live in _______.”
</p>



<p>
Amazingly enough, a woman in security/supervisory role just happened to be near the counter that I was at, and the lady told her about the problem. All she asked was, “Are you returning? When?” and told me bring a photocopy of my birthcert/drivers license when I return. Thus, my prayers were answered a miracle took place =)! I mean, others could have easily said, yes they were returning but never did (so they’d be stuck there or just buy another ticket). After the close call, we told my sister to return home but to later realise  that she would have to deliver it to Beckster’s place so that she could return it to me so I could use my money/phone/camera during the weekend…which were only partially returned on Sunday but I forgot to use the camera O_o…only the money.
</p>



<p>
Now for the extremely tight schedule:</p>



<p>
<i>Friday</i>:


</p><ol><li>Arrival @ Pearson, waited for ride which was stuck in traffic for over 1 hr.</li>




<li>Fellowship @ 19h00-00h00.<br>One comment: generally, the church peeps that I don’t know are not that friendly–not as much as OCAC/HCCC–but not as bad as T3C.</li>




<li>Met up w Albert, ‘Seph and went to some Chinese dessert place</li>


</ol><p>
<i>Saturday</i>: CNE all day and night (awake @ 7:30am bed @ 3:00am)–improv show velly goot! First time on Ferris wheel (woah, I didn’t realise how high it gets, but it was goot, just like the good ol’ swings was…and the carousel (nostaglic memories!). Went to play some @ the midway. Woah, the guy guessed that I was 21…must be my new haircut, makes my face look more old and round….so no prize there =).
</p>



<p>
<i>Sunday</i>:


</p><ol><li>Church @ 9h45</li>




<li>Coffee w/ Andy from 12h00-1h00</li>




<li>Lunch @ “home” @ 15h00</li>




<li>Dinner w/ Benjamin @ 18h30-20h00</li>




<li>Met up w TJ, Daniel, and Carey @ Le Bifteque 20h15-20h45</li>




<li>World Bowl chat w Jamsies (hehe, he was soo excited to see me! i feel so speshal 🙂 thx bro!) til 21h25</li>




<li>Gelato w Jen, Jazz, and Ben @ 22h30</li>




<li>LoveGety Station w the prior three…home at 1 am</li>


</ol><p>
P.S. During my trip to Victoria, at the ferry terminal, the lady asked my mom if I was over 11! My mom, not knowing what she meant asked her to repeat it, they all erupted in laughter =). HA! 11 years old??

Not having such a “hot” day today…tho I hear that it’s a-blazin’ in Kelowna (wow, that’s close–where I vacation way back when), and has almost reached body temp in ON w/o AC (power restraints). I forgot EVERYthing today it seems– this morning: my watch, my clipboard containing notes for the interview (which I didn’t need b/c everything, IMHO, was “blowing-h2o” and nothing too unexpected but i’m not too confident since i didn’t get a chance to say everything that i wanted to say or to “sell” myself well…not to mention that they never asked for my references. ah well, God knows what He’s doing =p); this afternoon: my phone and charger and clipboard at the office; and, finally this evening: my pen in Min’s car. Ironic, how my first and only interview thus far is w the company I want to work for most. Ironic, how PT bluntly once told me that I’d never make it into optometry and yet he has optimistic view when i told him about this potential opportunity. Ironic, how life just works :). Either way, whatever the outcome, to all my friends and prayer warriors– thanks for all your support and prayers! Next prayer item? Rain for the part of BC that I’m not in — to quench the flames 🙂
</p>



<p>
AH wells, hopefully this weekend will make up for the useless time my mind spends on mulling over things that I cannot control. Upon reflecting this week, I’ve also come to realise that it seems like I can’t keep away from a student’s life or being around students…first after I grad, I still work at UW, and now I’m at another school…UBC! hehe. quite funny (and fun! tho’ not yet as fun as my days making fun of l’il jozie..hehe). Anyhow, Victoria here I come! =)
