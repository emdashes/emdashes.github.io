		<p>				Delta Chelsea, is the one that we’re actually staying at, so it’s a lil more lower class…but still good I hope >.< Well, at least there’s a place to play arcades 😛

Ahhh! I spent more $ today. Aside from my belated bday gift from my parents (a MSI 40x12x48 CD-RW Drive for$89.99), I ended up purchasing a Gravis Tilt gamepad from EB (Rideau Centre) for a mere $9.99. Although I don’t have any games on my CPU at the moment, I was able to use it at Marc’s tonite to lose big time in NFS V. Tho’ now I have reason to play more games on my computer now b/c now I can use something else other than a keyboard :D.</p>

		<p>				Market is something I look forward to b/c of the crowds of ppl and the many things to look at..however, it tends to tempt me into buying. oddly, not clothes, but FOOD =). The smells of bread baking and the sounds of preparing various foods and drinks just makes me wanna eat. Tha’s kinda how I ended up munchin’ down a gelato (piccolo grande: was there for a fv), a homemade ice cream (see previous entry), and purchased some interesting mustard (Wasabi lime) for Marcy. I have yet to enjoy a <a href="http://www.beavertailsinc.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">beavertail</a> 🙂


</p><p>
Aiya, my cheapest textbook for next school term is $50. The most xpensive one is $121.95 =(. I hope to find some at Chapter’s so maybe then I can take advantage and purchase the 10% off card 🙂 Speaking of textbooks, I ended up in Place D’Orlèans yesterday to purchase some essentials from Wal-mart and ended up shopping around. Gap seems to be having an incredible sale (25% off of already sale items), and Coles has a final clearance on “As is” books. I ended up purchasing a txtbook called <i>Writing Software Documentation</i> by the same publishers as my previous textbook <i>Designing Visual Language</i> that I bought new at UW for $70.95. The funniest thing is that the Software Documentation one is a literal bounded photocopy of the real book; I brought it to the counter and asked the girl, “Is this a real/legit book?” She said it prolly is but couldn’t really tell me. But anyhow, I bought it anyway b/c I found better condition one for $9.99 (and asked for the $7.99 price b/c there was another one which was in a “worser” shape) ;). Hope this book would be a good reference for my course next term as well as for my future career :).
</p>



<p>
In the process, I also ended up at Grand and Toy to look through their clearance items as well and found myself buying another Pentel (tho Sanford/Uniball is betta) gel hybrid pen for my note-taking classes next term for $0.50. And an accessory keychain for my bag (retails for $7.99; got it for $1.99); I think it’s cute :D.
</p>



<p>
Oh! I almost forgot to mention how my work day ended at the Market today. I remembered that <a href="http://bassman_4f.blogspot.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jon</a> has this nasty lookin’ rash from gettin’ henna the other day, so I asked one of the booths (George Street and ByWard Market Sq.) what was in their ingredients. The henna guy was very informative and told me about the risks of chemicals in so-called henna, which produce side-effects including rashes (from chemical burns) and to the extremes, liver infection. If any stand advertise that it would stay for more than 10 days, it’s likely to contain PPD, a chemical that’s used in hair dyes (clue: “black henna”). Here’s an excerpt from an e-mail I sent out to my fellowship which refers one to the <a href="http://www.hennapage.com/henna/ppd/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">henna website</a>.
</p>



<p>
I have pulled the following off a similar website:
</p>



<p>
If you have received “black henna” and experience oozing sores, itching, blistering or rashes anytime up to 4 weeks after application, you probably have a PPD chemical burn! Do not try to treat it yourself. This is a serious chemical burn from a toxin, not an allergic reaction, and must be attended to professionally.
</p>



<p>
If a person has a reaction to traditional henna (just mild itching, not raised oozing blisters and scars), it is usually because of a sensitivity to the clove oil, mehlabiya oil, henna oil, or eucalyptus oil which were added to the mix. A person with sensitive skin should ask for traditional henna with only lemon juice added.
</p>



<p>
PS. As per Howie’s request, I have posted his <a href="http://integrityandhonor.blogspot.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">new blog</a> in my blog list. Welcome to the community Howard! :).
Oh! and to follow up on the Chinese article that I posted the other day on Willis’ death, here’s the <a href="http://www.thestar.com/NASApp/cs/ContentServer?pagename=thestar/Layout/Article_Type1&c=Article&cid=1026143376582&call_page=TS_GTA&call_pageid=968350130169&call_pagepath=GTA/News&col=969483202845" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">English version</a> as found in the Toronto Star. Please continue to pray for his family and the ones affected.</p>

</p><p>
Played PS2 yesterday and PS1 today :P. Thanks Jon–Beat Marc twice in GT2 🙂 I didn’t realise that the homemade ice cream shoppé next to the Beavertails booth on George Street is really really good. The coconut cone I had today actually contained REAL coconuts :).</p>

		<p>				SilQ. This year, <a href="http://lildimsum.blogspot.com" target="_new" rel="noopener noreferrer">Summie</a>. Now you’re prolly wonder’g what “it” is referring to; well, I basically prayed for fresh wind, fresh fire (no, I’ve never read that book, but if you read their blogs, you’ll see who they are today as a result)…now, someone pray for me so I will face such scary changes =).


</p><p>
Oh yeah, and as I whined about a whiner last week (so I guess that makes me a whiner too, thus a hypocrite…yes, I neglected to look at the plank in my eye bfore looking at the dust in the other’s eye), I prayed about it and today, I had a pretty good day at work (no pressure of stress) =). And it’s weird b/c the team member that I thought that I’d LEAST likely bring any aspect of religion or God into our conversations, I ended up bring’g to OCAC. Yeps. We had lunch in the AC comforts of OCAC =) (thanks to Daphne and the some other guy who kindly allowed us to eat lunch there–actually I kinda barged in w/o really asking..just kinda told them that we were gonna eat lunch–actually there was a round of intros when I asked them when PD was back). Who knows, perhaps theres hope for a seed to be wedged into this life…still much prayer needed =).
</p>



<p>
Oh WOW! I can’t believe it. If we end up at the hotel that we originally confirmed it to be (before arriving at some gov’t rate complications), i’d be in such a WONDERFUL place for the night. In-room Internet, a pool w waterslide, a Jap restaurant in the same building, my own bed (never happend before; usually gotta share a bed w my sista in hotels):

(first verse/refrain)
</p>



<p>
<i>
O Canada! Where pines and maples grow,<br>
 Great Praries spread, and lordly rivers flow.<br>
 How dear to us they broad domain,<br>
 From East to Western Sea!<br>
 Thy land of hope for all who toil,<br>
 Thou True North strong and free!

O Canada! Beneath thy shining skies<br>
May stalwart sons and gentle maidens rise,<br>
To keep thee steadfast through the years<br>
From East to Western Sea,<br>
Our own beloved native land!<br>
Our True North, strong and free!
</i>
</p>



<p>
(refrain)
</p>



<p>
<i>
Ruler supreme, who hearest humble prayer,<br>
Hold our dominion within thy loving care;<br>
Help us to find, O God, in thee<br>
A lasting, rich reward,<br>
As waiting for the Better Day,<br>
We ever stand on guard for thee.<br></i>

		<p>				UW Bulletin (Friday, June 29, 2002): <i>Willis Au, a second-year civil engineering student, died Sunday evening in Toronto, his home city. Visitation is this Saturday at 10 a.m., followed by the funeral at 11 a.m., at the Toronto Chinese Mennonite Church, 1038 Woodbine Avenue (corner of Danforth).</i> I feel that God’s name was indeed lifted up and proclaimed that day after reading Pork’s Sunday, June 30th entry. And from the sounds of it, the funeral and burial service went as well as it could’ve for such an occasion.
Saturday: Spent afternoon at the Mud Oven w Marcy. I d/n realise that figuring out a design an then painting it would be harder than I thought it is…evenin’ w Josh and Marc for Starbucks Fraps and dinner (tho J d/n eat) at Shawarma King on Bank St. City-wide P&W @ the Met (better this time b/c corporate prayer instead of groups), and more food w Hilman and Jon at Shawarma King yet again.
Sunday: helped Jon move into his new AC place and had dinner there. So tiring.
Monday: Canada Day. No wonder my feet really really hurt today at work. I was walking all day and was up at 7:32 AM. Marc called to wake me up and I ended up spending half of my day w Marc and his family downtown. I realised that it was my first time w his family doing smthing outside of the house. Actually, we ended up eating at 2 of the places that Marc told me to try, one of which was Eggspectation (eggstravagent, eggpensive, and eggcellent food =P). Walked to Parliament Hill to see horse dung everywhere and ppl stepping IN them. Actually, that was more of a result from the RCMP parade/musical ride thingy. Poor Simon, he was stuck in 43C (w humidex) weather as a guard for the changing of the guard ceremony. Saw some red ‘chuters jump from planes.
Afterwards, we decided to venture into the <a href="http://www.nac-cna.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NAC</a> to cool off from the heat and watched this <em>yawn</em> dance performance by the NAC School of Dance. Normally, I enjoy watching ballets and contemporary dances (drimes, hip hop, etc.), but I donno whether this collection was supposed to show off the talent of its students or not? In btwn, we caught a glimpse of the snowbirds flying in formation.
Subway for lunch. I’m starting to get sick of these subs, but at least they still have enuff hot subs and bread/toppings/dressings to choose from and they sure taste betta than McD’s :). Headed twd Major Hill’s park in hopes for me to get the new Cdn quarter, which is in circulation til September 2002, but the line was insanely long and it was insanely hot, so we ended up at the National Arts Gallery to cool down. We ventured into the Garden Court area and bumped into  J and Ange. So, we just vegged there for hrs upon end while we waited for ppl to show: napping, talking, goofin’ off, and playin’ cards. Frankly, I’m surprised that security didn’t kick us out.
Adrian and Chris, Cyn, Ben chan finally decided to arrive so we headed to Imperial Palace (that’s the second place to eat as recommended by Marcy–aside from Eggspectation). The Chinese food there is pretty good =). Unsurprisingly, the Chinese menu has a lot more “good” choices than the English one. Thankfully, I was able to read some of the dishes and some of us ended up trying “Toong Choy” (aka oong choy). Yay! Oong choy is in season =)–I’ll remember that next time I go to MK :P.
Firewrks started at 10:05 pm and we all crwded on Major Hill’s Park. The rest of the other guys (Dom, J, Ange, Tim Poon, Deb, Scott Yee, Andy, Matt, Hilman, Dawn, etc.) were at Parliment Hill. While waiting, Adrian and I walked around and we ended up seeing these 3 guys making music (imitiation all types of sound) all w their vocal chords. Neat eh? :). Ange later told me that they missed 25% of it b’c of the buildings, so I’m rather glad that we (Chris, Ben Chan, Marc, Jon, Bert, Adrian, Cyn, and later Elaina and Ben Hu, didn’t take Dawn’s advice to join them at the Hill. Took advantage of my slower shutter speed on my dig cam and took some pix. Unfortunately, my hands naturally shake, so mine didn’t turn out too well, but the couple that Marcy took on my cam were okay :). All in all, the fireworks were definitely worth it! Yaay! Tho’ I missed them last year, I got to see them this year. My cos claims that they heard the resonance of the big ones even in Gloucester-Ottawa area! One observation tho: July 1 seems to be a very odd day: Yesterday was super hot (43C w humidex: hottest of entire summer thus far aside from today), and last year was the coldest (6C).
I neglected to mention the three brats that kicked my bag around and got it dirty. Basically, we were in an area of space and our bags were on the floor (decorated w sidewalk chalk in front of us by the fence so basically our bodies surrounded the bags). As the fireworks were about to start, 3 kids (7-11 year olds?) pushed their way in and stood in front of us. Elaina and I gave each other looks and kinda said, “what the heck?!” in Chinese. I was gonna shrug it off but then they started to kick our bags around. Cyn askd them to be careful of our stuff, but they still walked all over our stuff. I wasn’t too pleased and started talking behind their backs in Chinese. Elaina, tho, bascially said everything in English, asking to watch where they stepped. The oldest daughter proceeded to talk back and say, “well, your bags shouldn’t be on the floor to begin with. You should watch where you put your things”.  If I’d known who their parents were, I would’ve gave the parents a piece of my mind. First, discipline your kids. Secondly, teach them some manners. They talk back, are rude, and very inconsiderate. Not only did they not say, “Excuse me” (cept when they tried to go out and we didn’t really let them) or apologise, as the boys left their spots, the girl tried to hog her body across the “empty” space. Anyhow, I felt that last year’s Veggie Tales keeners were a lot more tolerable than these kids. Elaina ended up saying that she was tempted to not have kids because of these people. heheh. I persuaded her to teach her kids well if she ever ends up having them ;P.]]>		</p>

		<p>				Lilo & Stitch


</p><p>
A fellow brother in Christ means a part of God’s family. Although many of us might not know Willis on a more personal level, such as myself, I won’t forget his giving nature. As a chemical engineering student at UW who live at WCRI, he would often offer to give rides to ppl to church on Sundays. Most of the time, I already had a ride, but I appreciated his offer to drive people there and back. His sudden death hits really close to home. At such a young age, one’s life is gone without any forewarning…and yet life goes on–e-mail is streaming into one’s inbox day by day without the sender knowing that the holder of the e-mail account will not ever check it ever again (tho’ that’s strange, someone just checked his e-mail account today (since Friday, the 21st at 11 pm)–assuming that wau@engmail is him….). My question to Christians: what are you going to do with your life? Will you impact and change the world for Christ? And for those who are yet to have a personal relationship with our Creator and Saviour: where are you going with your life? As a member of His family, Willis will not be left behind or forgotten.

<a href="http://www.liloandstitch.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lilo & Stitch</a> was a really wholesome Disney movie and for Veggie Tale lovers, Jonah, the movie is coming to a theatre near you in Fall 2002! That’s right folks: BIG screen! :). I also bought a couple of academic books from the Gloucester Library. They have SUCH cheap “used” books! One was a book on literary criticisms/essays on Fairy Tales from women writers and the other was a handbook: <i>A Canadian’s Writers Reference</i>. Both are in super good condition (better than UW used books) and although they retail for $19.95 and $18.95 respectively, I only got them for $1 CDN a book :). They had other academic txtbooks and software reference books too. I think English criticism has grown on me; I would’ve never touched anything for fun like that before university. What a geek eh? =P</p>

		<p>				 My weekend in <i>“short”</i>. Note:
          Pix up from trip on <a href="http://community.webshots.com/user/aimeili" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">webshots</a>.
          
<font face="Georgia" size="-1"> Saturday: Went to NY for one day (yes,
          from Ottawa). </font>
<font face="Georgia" size="-1"> My mom wanted me to gain some driving
          experience b/c she didn’t want me to get hurt on my job b/c I’d be driving
          every day, and well, I haven’t driven in close to 4 years now (I think
          my driving xperience w the Volvo 850 helped me get up to par as well..thanks
          DD :] ). So my parents offered to pay for a car rental to let me drive.
          Hehe. I practically <i>jumped</i> at the opportunity to rent a car so
          that I could go see the famous <a href="http://www.visit1000islands.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1000
          Islands</a> and <a href="http://www.boldtcastle.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Boldt’s
          Castle</a> (that’s their official site; excuse their poor web design.
          i am only referencing it for reference purpose 😛 here’s a better one).
          </font>
        

</p><p align="left"><font face="Georgia" size="-1">So, I booked my car two
          weeks in adv</font><font face="Georgia" size="-1">ance. To tell you
          the truth, I had wanted to go last weekend but it rained and poured
          so much that I had to resched our trip, which turned out to be interesting.
          Why? Because I found out that car rental companies have different rates
          per week. The week I reserved a car online, the quoted rates for the
          compact and economy sized cars at <a href="http://www.thrifty.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Thrifty’s</a>
          was approx. $28/day. So, of course, I chose the largest one in the price
          range (compact). However, when I tried to postpone my reservation, the
          website quoted for the following week as being $49! yipes. So what else
          do I do? I turn on my see-lai thinking cap, and call the company to
          see if I can keep my quoted price and lo and behold, it worked (I later
          learned, through the rental agent that they actually have a 4-level
          tier that fluctuates in the year and b//c peak in the summer)! =)</font>
        </p>



<p align="center"> <font face="Georgia" size="-1"></font>
        </p>



<p align="left"> <font face="Georgia" size="-1"> Thus, yesterday, Marcy
          and I bused to the airport to pick up my car (woohoo, I had a car to
          actually call “my own” for the day :P). Turns out that they didn’t have
          any Chrysler Neons left (blech!) and upgraded me to a specialty car,
          which was the 2002
          Jeep Liberty Limited Edition. I remember that in the old days, rental cars were pretty junkie and often dirty and stunk like stale cigarette smoke. Now, we get NEW cars, along with the “new car smell”–talk about good customer service :). Yes,
          a “mini” SUV. I would’ve never imagined that one of my first vehicles
          that I could drive would be a 4×4 SUV–but I’d drive this than the Neon
          any day!. I think this one is rather “cute”…but kinda tipsy..it’s
          funny b/c there’s a sticker warning in the vehicle that reminds us of
          that factor. Not to mention that the 3.7L V6 engine (which we got) boasts
          of 210 HP and 235 lb-ft torque! The best part is that the seat is soo
          high up that I can actually see OVER the dashboard w/o having to sit
          up really straight =). I was soo comfie in the driver’s seat! (Side
          note: Just rode in a Miata that drifted and turned nicely at high speeds
          =P) </font>
<font face="Georgia" size="-1"> We
          left in late morning and arrived at around 12:30 PM. We had lunch in
          the car and then took the boat cruise to the island. It’s a wee lil
          antique lookn boat that ferried us across the St. Lawrence River to
          Heart Island for $11/person. Other higher class boats were more expensive
          at $24/person! I’m kinda glad we saved on that b/c the admission to
          Boldt’s Castle was $7.10 (cdn: fluctuates with USD $4.25)/person. The
          captain told us stories of surrounding islands on its way to/from the
          castle. For example, we saw the house built on the island by the Wrigley
          (Gum) family, an island owned by a frat (seen <i>The Skulls</i>? Same
          frat.) from Yale, an island with only a picnic table and dog shack,
          islands that had pine trees on one side, and maples on the other (due
          to microclimates), a big island that had only trees growing on it and
          a big cross erected upright to commemorate the family’s son’s fatal
          death from falling off a cliff (and forbade to build on island thereonin),
          and an American and Canadian island that was connected by the “world’s
          shortest international bridge”. There is no one island that’s half American,
          half Canadian for the “world’s longest peaceful border” goes around
          these islands. Ah yeah, they need to check for photo ID and proof of
          citizenship since it’s in Alexandria Bay, NY if you ever go to the Castle.
          </font>
<font face="Georgia" size="-1">The
          castle didn’t really have a moat or a drawbridge (not a visible drawbridge
          anyhow) but it did have a servants’ underground passage that led to
          a pool…actually, most of the place has been restored (ie. original
          structure has detriorated). The bowling alley in the playhouse is in
          the process of restoration (water leakage)…the wooden floors kinda
          felt soggy for some reason so it felt like it was gonna give away at
          anytime…the story behind this island is that a man bought it and built
          it for his wife (what a guy eh?! that wife must’ve felt special indeed!).
          Unfortunately, midway, his wife suddenly died and he received a telegram
          and ceased work immediately. That poor fellow must’ve been heart-broken…I
          really like the architectural work on it tho :). They also had a Yacht
          House, which we didn’t go to b/c they charge ya another $4 or so for
          admission. Finished day early and drove back :). Twas a very fun adventure!
          =) </font>

		<p>				 Excitement at work! We get paid to travel (drive to in our Ministry
          Vehicle) to Toronto on July 24th (Wednesday) for a day career conference
          held by the Ministry of Labour on the Thursday. So, if any of you TOians
          are in the downtown area (900 Bay Street @ Queen’s Park?) or just wanna
          meet up on Wednesday evening, gimme a shout/leave me a e-msg and i’ll
          give ya a call when I arrive on Wed night (and for those who still would
          like to avoid me, avoid going to Pac Mall or anywhere in TO for those
          2 days :P). The sweetest thing yet is that if we go, we <i>each</i>
          get our very own rooms at Days Inn =). We also get two paid allowances
          for dinner as well as OT for the drive back after the conference ends
          on Thursday afternoon! 🙂 Additionally, they even allow us to start
          driving during work hours on the Wednesday :). Why would anyone <i>not</i>
          want to go? This totally gives us at least 2 days of break from doing
          field work :þ.</p>
