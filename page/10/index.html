		<p>				tales of woe that customers have posted on your Facebook page were also one-offs because happy customers aren’t usually as vocal as unhappy customers; alas, my first end-to-end experience dealing with sears.ca and customer service support would end in disappointment and ire.
Maybe I shouldn’t have brushed off my in-store experience, where the clerk successfully got me to sign up for the company credit card, adamantly claiming that the bonus reward card would work everywhere in store, failing to admit that it wouldn’t work at the photo studio (where we are regular patrons, knowing that it is third-party owned) even to the point of accompanying me to the studio to try to prove herself right because I specifically asked if it would work there and  then went back to her informing her that they didn’t take it when I tried to pay with it.
So, I now had a credit card that I don’t know what to do with, because I seldom shop at Sears outside of the photo studio. Lo and behold, a few weeks later, my bread machine dies on me and Sears.ca has a Kitchen-Aid mixer on sale for half off!  Well, my credit card could certainly be applied there, as with my bonus gift card. Sadly, my attempt at buying one failed: after filling out all my billing and shipping information, it informs me that is $0, and that the item was unavailable. The order confirmation email also showed that I got it for $0 (really? a free product? I had really doubted that it would ship), and only when I called customer service that they then told me it was out of stock.
The poor shopping interface and process left a bad taste in my mouth, but clearly not bad enough to try to buy another item. Being the sucker that I clearly am, I fell for another item that was on sale. This time at least, the site did say that it was backordered and that it wouldn’t ship until mid-August. Okay, I can wait and do proceed with my order. Except, I don’t receive an order confirmation via email like last time, nor do I recall seeing a confirmation page.
I call customer support the next day to ask about it, and they told me that they had problems with my credit card. Would they have called me if I didn’t call them or would the order have been automatically cancelled? Thankfully, the answer was yes, because they called later that afternoon asking for my credit card information again – though the ideal situation would have been to alert the customer during the transaction online.
It’s the beginning of August, and surprise: my order shows up early! What a great way to delight the customer! A little disappointed that UPS would just door drop a 26lb box worth over $200 on the porch, but perhaps that’s not Sears’ fault. I open the door, lug it into the entrance way…but wait…WHY did they send me a lower model (I may be poor at numbers, but 100 is not the same as 120!)?
Guess I’m calling customer service. I know now that our calls are likely re-routed to a call centre in the Philippines, where the agents follow a script, and if you ask too many questions that the scripts don’t have answers too, they put you on hold as often as you ask another question and send you in circles. For instance, the first rep told me that my package was backordered and that it wasn’t shipped yet. No? Then why am I staring at it in front of me? I didn’t order anything else from Sears Canada. I highly doubt that I’m getting another package mid-August.
Eventually when I asked to speak to a customer service representative in Canada or put me through to his supervisor, he put me on hold. But instead of a new voice, the same voice comes back on the line and gives me a number to call. I check my phone. Wait, this is the EXACT number I called with the prompts you’re telling me to follow, which brought me to you. <em>Oh, wait. Do you mind holding?</em> Yes I mind, but I will hold anyway. This time he gives me another toll-free number promising that I will be calling Sears Canada. I hang up, and dial that number. <em>Welcome to Sears Home Services…</em>wait. I didn’t buy an appliance or lawn mower.  A baby car seat hardly fits into any of those prompts and pressing 0 doesn’t get me anywhere. He probably just gave me a number to appease me.
Googling Sears Canada gives me another toll-free number, which I try. It gets redirected to a customer service agent with a similar accent. He seems more knowledgeable, but transfers me to someone else who tries to get me to return it to the store for a product exchange. Sorry, I am not going to lug a 26lb box with my baby to the store without a car to find out that you don’t have any in stock (which they don’t apparently, I asked him to check for me…makes sense, since it is backordered until mid-August). I get it, you also can’t refund anything until you physically get the item but the onus is on you, for sending me the incorrect product. I ask if I could send it via post (since our post office is walking distance) or back with the driver, he finally says yes after putting me on hold to ask his supervisor, and yes, shipping charges will be reimbursed.  I try to ask him to email me the address that I should ship it back to, but after 30 mins of back and forth and putting me on a number of holds, the line was accidentally disconnected.
60 minutes of poor customer support.  I don’t call back because I only have a limited number of daytime minutes on my phone plan so I reach out to @SearsAssist on Twitter, to which I get a prompt response but at the end of the day, the box is still sitting at my entrance with this still unresolved. I do hope that I will get my product, and maybe an answer to why Sears Canada tried to send me a lower model of the product I ordered without my prior approval. Had someone hoped that we wouldn’t have noticed? Isn’t it reasonable to expect to receive the product that you paid for (or better!), instead of getting one that is worth less…?
Sincerely,
A customer that feels scammed.
PS. Just saw a link from your Facebook page about the <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/sears-canada-to-lay-off-624-employees-1.2516343" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">three-year turn around plan</a>: <em> “”The changes we are making in stores will not affect the number of front-line associates, and service to our customers will not be impacted,” president and CEO Doug Campbell said in a release.”</em> If changes aren’t going to affect customer service for the better, then will your turning around just mean you’re going in circles? Maybe you should consider investing some resources in user experience to review your end-to-end experience…mistakes happen, but some of the disconnects could have been avoidable.]]>		</p>

Initially, I had wanted to cruise with Holland America, after hearing so much good reviews with them, but we ended up settling with Celebrity Cruises instead. Even after we booked, our travel agent managed to find a better deal: Little Bean cruised for free, plus we got a stateroom upgrade for the same price! Seeing that we would be limited to our cabin when Little Bean was sleeping, we paid a premium for a balcony so that we could sit outside and read or appreciate the view despite the chilly weather – though of course, after staying in a balcony stateroom from our honeymoon, we haven’t been able to downgrade again.
This line was also an upgrade to the other cruise lines we have traveled with in the past, and despite my initial reservations about them being owned by Royal Caribbean (which we had negative experiences with on our previous cruise), we were very happy with our experience overall. Aside from the glitches at the beginning with a non-functional stateroom fridge and missing baby food (yes, you can pre-order baby food jars beforehand at no extra charge!), this one seemed less in-your-face cheesy, the decor less tacky, people were more orderly (less chaos on the “shopping nights”), and the food quality and execution to be better (the pastries and desserts at the café were a highlight, especially the almond croissants). Service seemed less forced, but wasn’t absent either; dining room staff went above and beyond to switch us from set time dining (and shared table) to our own table flexible dining times, and our server brought Little Bean her own plate of food that wasn’t even on the menu (avocado, watermelon, and other melon cubes) even though we always had a jar of baby food with us. We were pleasantly surprised that we got a complimentary tour of the kitchen galley, unlike other cruise lines, and learned just how vast the kitchens are and how much is made from scratch (including the lovely pastries and desserts)! I also appreciated that the activities they offered on board went beyond activities like basic ballroom or napkin folding, like basic watercolours, and that you could borrow toys from the children’s area for the duration of the cruise. Furthermore, if your wee one spent any time in the children’s area, playing with any of the toys, they took care to disinfect it at the end of the day (provided the parent tossed it into the used-toys bin).
Okay, so the targeted demographics on this cruise line is definitely not your Disney or Royal Caribbean Oasis/Allure of the Seas ships; there are no rock-climbing walls, water slides, zip-lines, carousels, costumed characters, or cinematic theatre under the stars (the latter mayhaps because of the chilly weather, seeing that the outdoor pool was also closed). But, the performances, though not Broadway, were solid; j.w was impressed that the lead performers could both sing and dance at the same time. With the limited options for evening activities, that meant that we could retire early without feeling that I missed too much. I was certainly surprised to learn that this cruise was the first cruise for many of the older folks we met!
Little Bean made new friends quickly: Maria, the host at the dining room, the Metropolitan; Azem, the assistant Maitre’D (who just adores babies, and even introduced her to his fiancée over from the Q’Sine to meet her on the last night, which I thought was the sweetest thing); and little Emma, daughter of a God-fearing  father who serves in the Air Force, and whose Christian mother shared about her struggles with transitioning to a stay-at-home-mom.


</p><h3>The Weather</h3>


[caption id="" align="alignnone" width="640"]<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/aimeili/14299623020/"><img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2896/14299623020_8a36595a36_z.jpg" alt="" height="480" width="640"></a> A rainy day at Icy Strait Point[/caption]
Although we had hoped for sunshine and warm weather (which they had a week before our sailing as we heard from one of j.w’s former pastors that he randomly bumped into at the Anchorage airport),  the clouds and rain followed us for the most part, but it didn’t deter us from seeing the sights; in fact, I think because of it, we met less people along the way. God kept us dry for the most part though and gave us sunshine in patches, which meant staying cool and having more dramatic photos; the day it poured, we were either watching whales from our balcony, or driving along the Skagway highway (we had a different view on the way back, when it cleared up!). The $8 stroller cover also kept our little one dry. Plus, we had almost a week of sunshine and warmth in Vancouver!
The inclement weather may have been the reason for the rocky waters during the first two days from Seward to Juneau; I just ended up sleeping early when I started to feel it in the claustrophobic washroom in our stateroom. Turned out that many others fared worse – the mom we made friends with had to skip the rest of her dinner, and one of the shows had to be postponed to another day.
So, what did we see in Alaska?


<h3>Alaska – Glaciers</h3>


When we first chose Alaska, I had doubts with the destination choice as my mother didn’t seem to like the itinerary when they went a decade ago; she had found the ports relatively uninteresting. However, she did say her favourite part was visiting Hubbard Glacier, so we made sure that was included in our itinerary. Ironically, I was actually disappointed with it the most, perhaps because I was expecting a grandeur that my mother had described. Sadly, perhaps it is because of the environmental impact and decay over the last decade or because of the poor weather, but we didn’t get as close to the glacier as expected and it looked much smaller and less majestic than the photos that my parents had of it when we compared photos later. Fortunately, we managed to see a few other glaciers as well, including Trail Glacier as seen from the train trip from Anchorage to Seward, Exit Glacier in Seward, which you can almost touch when you walk right up to it, and Mendenhall Glacier in Juneau.

<h3>Alaska – Wildlife</h3>


Oddly enough, one of my favourite ports was Icy Strait Point, a fishing village that is close to Hoonah that’s really only dedicated to cruise ship traffic. The sights to see around the port didn’t seem all that terrific, especially on a rainy day, but we were rewarded with views of whales along the shoreline <em>and</em> from our balcony. We returned to the ship much earlier than the sailing time, but we had great views of pods of fin whales despite the rain. Apparently on the port side, those in the buffet dining room and on a kayak excursion had a treat; they saw with 6 whales playing together, whereas we, on the starboard side, saw 3 at a time.

We also saw many bald eagles flying about throughout our trip, notably in Icy Strait Point and in Juneau (the capital city of Alaska, where no roads lead out of Juneau; you can only arrive via air or sea). Most of the other wildlife we encountered was during our 5 hour train ride from Anchorage to Seward: a family of grizzlies, a black bear, mountain sheep, and young caribou dashing across the pond. The one other “wildlife” we came across was a family of slugs in Ketchikan, which I found amusing that people were grossed out over them on Facebook, but perhaps I grew up seeing slugs everywhere that it merely served as a reminder of the West Coast climate.

<h4>Anchorage</h4>

Anchorage, the closest airport to our departure port is 5 hours away by rail, which was one of the most rewarding trips by train I’ve taken – with incredible views of wildlife, glaciers, and other scenery. Because we travelled on a day that didn’t have too many passengers, we were able to sit in the bubble car for the majority of it instead of our assigned seats. For the city with an international airport, I was surprised how small it seemed; the Grand Anchorage hotel looked to be further from the train station on the map, but it was just a 5 minute walk away.


<h4>Seward</h4>


Seward was a much quainter town, and I ended up really loving our stay at <a href="http://sauerdoughlodging.com/the-sleeper/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sauerdough Lodging</a>, aside from the pack n’ play looking very dirty, the layout of the place was perfect for us: the futon couch happened to be on an incline, they had a lounging chair perfect for nursing, and the kitchen was separated enough for us to cook (the fresh wild sockeye salmon) and enjoy our meal while the little one slept; that night was one of the few nights that we stayed up late enough to see the skies get dark (after 10pm). They were also the folks who told us about the free shuttle that Seward offers.

Bob may be your uncle, but our BOB really pulled through for us, especially on our hike to Exit Glacier. We decided to buy one right before our trip, and I had enough fitness credits left to claim it on my work benefits insurance plan. We took it with us and it really served us well; I found that it was easier to maneuver and that it felt lighter than our 10lb Peg Perego Aria even though it is a 25lb stroller, and Little Bean seemed quite comfortable in it.

<h4>Juneau</h4>


We rented a car for the day ($30ish) and drove to see Mendenhall Glacier and the falls, and also visited Alaskan Brewing Company, which offered 4-5 generous glasses of samples of their beers, but sadly, I don’t drink that much alcohol. We lugged a case back with us (choosing to put the case in the stroller over the baby and carrying her instead since she was lighter), but we had too much stuff to bring back from Vancouver so we had to leave a few in BC for now.

<h4>Skagway</h4>


Instead of taking the $200+ White Pass Yukon rail excursion, we opted to rent a car for $80/day and drove a similar scenic route.  Now, I can say that I’ve been to all the provinces, except Manitoba and one territory! Even though we put in hundreds of kilometres on the car in terms of mileage, the drives were quite leisurely – along the mountain roads and every so often, you’d be rewarded with a view along the pull outs. Memorable stops include Fraser, BC (one of the most hassle-free border crossings ever), the Yukon sign, Carcross (desert dunes and for lunch), and Emerald Lake – the color of the water living up to its name.

<h4>Icy Strait Point</h4>


Unless you do a kayak excursion or you happen upon some whales (as mentioned above and as shown below), there doesn’t seem to be much to see at this stop.

<h4>Ketchikan</h4>


Although one of Ketchikan’s signs says that they get a lot of rain, we actually saw sunshine at this port. Being the Chinese that we are, we made good use of the $4 fee to use the funicular for a 60-second ride up to the hotel by taking it up a few times, and then hiking down two different short trails. Though on our last hike, we walked up the stairs in the middle of a “street” (the street IS the stairway) and took it down. Creek Street is probably the most unique area, and according to repeat cruisers, you can practically wade through the salmon that swims upstream there if you come at the right time (later in August?). We also found an extensive outdoors (thinking shoes and outer wear gear) store near the port, which had some good deals as well.


<h4>Vancouver</h4>

Well, what did we do in Vancouver? We ate a lot, as usual, and visited our friends in the Seattle area again. I really enjoyed the duck confit at the French restaurant that my sister told us about, Café Salade de Fruits – great value: good prices, portions, and taste.


<h2>Milestones</h2>


Little Bean sprouted a number of teeth (2-3?) while on vacation, but it didn’t seem to bother her all that much except for the week leading up to them poking out. She also got better at standing supported, especially for long periods of time while playing on the activity table (we found it to be very good for her development so we ended up getting a similar one once we got back!)
In the category of food, we  discovered that she uses her pincer grip without any problems (using her forefinger and thumb to pick up food like avocado and watermelon bits), and likes to feed other people her food too. Like her mommy, she seems to love bread – this discovery was purely accidental; our table for 2 was small, so the dishes are often close to her high chair. When the basket was put down on the table, her hand reached out and grabbed a small loaf bun and quickly stuffed it in her mouth. She showed us that she could “clap” (applaud) and point at things which captivate her attention. Towards the end of the trip, it looked like she managed to sip from a sippy cup, but she drank water from a cup directly with much less effort, though the way she does is still like how she suckles. We were also very surprised that she seemed to know that certain things were not food, like when she played with sand for the very first time – she didn’t try to put any of it into her mouth!

PS. Finally got around to posting about our trip. Month 11 has flown by too quickly, with the highlight being a visit from my sister and niece. Oh, and happy birthday, Prince George!]]>

		<p>				Life With A Baby organized a workshop and taught us how to make 4 cleaning products and generous samples to take home. She highlighted that some essential oils not only help to make your cleaner smell nice, but they have anti-fungal, anti-bacterial, and anti-septic properties which work really well with the cleaning base (like vinegar or baking soda).

		<p>				Spoiler alert: If you’re sensitive to biological body functions, read no further. When you’re parents, you soon learn that pretty much anything goes in terms of topics of conversation, especially at the dinner table.
At 9 months, her mostly vegetarian diet (+chicken) has expanded to include other fruits and vegetables, and she happily tries new foods like green peppers, red kale, and pasta. We have been a little more laid back at letting her eat more textured foods (read: bite-sized pieces) but that results in a more effort-ful bowel movements. So, on the advice of the nurse practitioner, we bought some dried prunes (organic) from the grocery store and fed her some, but it didn’t seem to work. Lesson of the day? Purée them. The results are definitely more immediate and repeated, which include what she ate days ago (like the bite-sized prunes haha).
<strong>Milestones?</strong> Bum shuffling, crawling backwards, two nights of sleeping 8 hours straight (!), banging/drumming on surfaces like a home-made “drum” (fill a container with rice) and splashing in the water, dumping contents out, standing up with support…
…and a few nights of deprived sleep for everybody: she came down with a bad cold – sneezing with projectile snot and snoring like a little piggy due to being so stuffed up, but she bounced back within 2 days – their immune systems are amazing!  Daddy also bravely administered a homemade saline solution and sucked out some snot since they don’t know how to blow their noses yet, sadly.  Today, she’s back to her usual self, which we (I) dearly missed. Also, seems like Mommy tends to catch what she has a few days after, but it takes her a week to get over it.
In my sleep-deprived state while driving, I heard a snippet of a sermon (talk?) on the radio that really struck a chord in light of this situation: the speaker suggested that God doesn’t take away trials and tribulations, but rather through them, which is supported by John 16:33*; I shouldn’t be praying that this ordeal didn’t happen (especially since it ends up building their immune systems), but rather that we will get through this, learning from the experience and praying for patience with each other.
*<a href="https://www.bible.com/bible/59/jhn.16.33" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">John 16:33 (NIV)</a>:


</p><blockquote><span class="verse v33 selected" data-usfm="JHN.16.33"><span class="wj"><span class="content">“I have told you these things, so that in me you may have peace. In this world you will have trouble. But take heart! I have overcome the world.”</span></span></span></blockquote>


I am also reminded of <a href="https://www.bible.com/bible/59/jhn.16.33" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1 Corinthians 10:13</a>, where some say that temptations include trials and suffering:


<blockquote><span class="verse v13 selected" data-usfm="1CO.10.13"><span class="content">No temptation</span><span class="content"> has overtaken you except what is common to mankind. And God is faithful; he will not let you be tempted</span><span class="content"> beyond what you can bear. But when you are tempted,</span><span class="content"> he will also provide a way out so that you can endure it.</span></span></blockquote>

		<p>				<em>How do you [two] always know these things [about deals]? Never ceases to amaze me.</em>


My mother, who once accompanied me to the grocery store, made a similar comment when I walked out with much more than what I paid. First of all, I don’t <em>always</em> know about these things, but perhaps after reading this post, you can know about “these things” too! (Disclaimer: some links below are referral links so I will get some bonus if you sign up for an account by clicking through)
<strong><em>Tips:</em> </strong>


</p><ol><li>As mentioned in the <a title="Freebies for the Expectant Mother" href="http://her.happyhippos.ca/2014/03/freebies-for-the-expectant-mother/">Freebies for the Expectant Mother</a> post, use a throw-away or junk email address, created specifically for these. Sometimes, for one-time promotions, I would even use a temporary public email address (e.g. <a href="https://maildrop.cc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">maildrop.cc</a>), if I’m not asked for identifiable information like my mailing address. You can also use your <a href="https://www.canadapost.ca/flex" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FlexDelivery</a> address so that samples come to your post office instead of your home address (so you don’t have to give your private address for marketing purposes).</li>


    

<li>Some would even suggest creating a dummy Facebook account to “Like” marketing sites, so that you don’t give them any personal information, like your friend’s list or spam your friends’ feeds telling everyone you liked a store (just so you can get that one coupon!)</li>


    

<li>Use an RSS feed reader (e.g. feedly or Thunderbird) to keep a tabs on the latest deals that are shared on various sites so that you don’t have to sign up and get unnecessary emails, especially since deals tend to overlap on multiple sites. The primary deal-feeds I use are <a href="http://simplyfrugal.ca" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">simplyfrugal.ca</a>, <a href="http://redflagdeals.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">redflagdeals.com</a>, and <a href="http://groceryalerts.ca" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">groceryalerts.ca</a></li>


</ol><h3>Saving with Coupons</h3>


I clip and save physical coupons in a <a href="https://www.google.ca/search?client=firefox-a&hs=tlx&rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&channel=fflb&biw=1618&bih=987&tbm=isch&sa=1&q=coupon+envelope&oq=coupon+envelope&gs_l=img.3..0l2j0i24.4410.6672.0.6839.17.12.1.4.4.0.149.1304.7j5.12.0....0...1c.1.41.img..0.17.1312.gzRldEjIiUQ#facrc=_&imgdii=U6IzRjKlQjARcM%3A%3Bwe8ylNI4Oqca5M%3BU6IzRjKlQjARcM%3A&imgrc=U6IzRjKlQjARcM%253A%3BP9JVD6-NSW2NPM%3Bhttp%253A%252F%252Fhoosierhomemade.com%252Fwp-content%252Fuploads%252F2009%252F06%252Fnew-coupon-organizer4-300x225.jpg%3Bhttp%253A%252F%252Fhoosierhomemade.com%252Fnew-coupon-organizer%252F%3B300%3B225" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">plastic tabbed envelope</a> (purchased from Daiso) in my car: one for groceries, one for dining out, and now one for baby gear. I know London Drugs, in Western Canada (BC) allows for coupon stacking, but I don’t know of a place here that allows for that. However, I do combine coupons with sales or clear-out prices.
Where do I find my coupons generally?


<ul><li><strong>In-store:</strong> I save coupons from the tear pads either at the front of the store (e.g. Superstore) or in the product aisles. Usually, if there is a coupon, the product isn’t actually on sale, so I save it for a future sale.
<em>Note:</em> Some  coupons have a value equal or greater than the product (thus becoming a freebie), and depending on which store you use it, you may have to pay tax on the product (e.g. Shoppers Drug Mart) or they may deduct the value from the total amount off your entire purchase (e.g. Walmart)</li>


    

<li><strong>Flyers / Newspaper inserts / Coupon booklets</strong>: even though I don’t read my community newspaper often, I do keep my eye out for inserts in the flyers and coupon booklets that come in the mail, such as:


<ul><li><a href="http://www.adsave.ca" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AdSave</a> and <a href="http://couponclipper.dealspace.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Coupon Clipper</a>, for coupons to local restaurants</li>


    

<li>P&G Brandsaver and Redplum flyer inserts for savings on household products (e.g. laundry detergent, paper towels, toothpaste)</li>


    

<li>Coupons from chains directly (e.g. free McDonald’s coffee – which  might not be available in the online version)</li>


</ul></li>


    

<li><strong>Online</strong> – Facebook, other coupon or store websites (grocery-related ones often redirected from groceryalerts.ca):


<ul><li><a href="http://www.gocoupons.ca" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">gocoupons.ca</a></li>


    

<li><a href="http://www.websaver.ca" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">websaver.ca</a></li>


    

<li><a href="http://www.save.ca" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">save.ca</a></li>


    

<li><a href="http://www.retailmenot.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">retailmenot.com</a> for discount codes to just about any site</li>


    

<li><a href="https://www.ebates.ca/referrer?referrerid=yU%2FqV3WLdF8%3D" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ebates</a> and <a href="http://joinhoney.com/ref/6c0jqi" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Honey</a> for cash back or promo codes for online shopping. Note that some of these online rebate sites can’t be combined with each other.</li>


</ul></li>


</ul><h3>Saving with Apps and Loyalty Programs</h3>




<ul><li>I don’t fare as well with cash-back rebates, as I generally find it more of a hassle to remember, but two apps I keep tabs on are <del>SnapSaves</del> (now acquired by Groupon and has become <a href="http://snap.groupon.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Snap</a>) and <a href="http://www.checkout51.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Checkout51</a>. How it works it that you upload receipts to show proof ofpurchase and once you save up a certain cash-back amount, they mail you a cheque (or send it to your PayPal account)


<ul><li>*Update: a few others have popped up, like <a href="https://www.zweet.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Zweet</a>, <a href="http://www.save.ca/mobile-offers" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Save.ca’s mobile app</a>, <a href="http://www.changio.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Changio</a></li>


</ul></li>


    

<li>Loyalty programs with account-specific offers (e.g. <a title="Starbucks Rewards" href="https://www.starbucks.ca/card/rewards" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Starbucks</a>, <del>Sobeys</del>, <a title="PC Plus" href="https://www.pcplus.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PC Points</a>, <a title="Optimum Points" href="http://www1.shoppersdrugmart.ca/en/Optimum" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Optimum</a>)</li>


</ul><h3>In-store Sales</h3>




<ul><li><a title="Sale Whale" href="http://www.salewhale.ca" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Salewhale.ca</a> tells me which grocery items at which stores are on sale this week</li>


    

<li><a title="flipp" href="http://www.flipp.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Flipp</a> (app): shows most of the weekly local flyers on a  virtual “shelf”</li>


    

<li>50% off / store clearance (e.g. Loblaw-owned stores tend to mark soon-to-expire or overstock products with a neon 50% off sticker, making them easier to spot). Some of our local grocery stores (like Sobeys) will mark down more groceries, meat, bread, and prepared foods the evening before a holiday closure.</li>


    

<li><a title="Item Free Scanner Policy" href="http://www.competitionbureau.gc.ca/eic/site/cb-bc.nsf/eng/03252.html#s1_0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Scanner Price Accuracy Voluntary Code</a>: many grocery stores (including Shoppers Drug Mart) adopt the policy where if the scanned price is greater than list price, the first item up to $10 is free (or $10 off if exceeds $10)</li>


</ul><h3><strong>Freebies</strong></h3>




<ul><li>Known registered <strong>birthday freebies</strong>/deals locally include:


<ul><li>free drink at Starbucks / drink or tea leaves at Teavana</li>


    

<li>additional 25% off RW&Co (some might let you combine it with the $1 off discount if you bring back a RW bag)</li>


    

<li>a small cosmetic gift from Sephora</li>


    

<li>free cone at Marble Slab Creamery</li>


    

<li>free drink at Booster Juice</li>


    

<li>a drink from Chatime via Vicinity loyalty rewards (you must opt in to receive notifications and register your birthday in advance)</li>


</ul></li>


    

<li><strong>Free samples</strong>: brandsampler.ca (no longer active – now <a title="Procter & Gamble" href="http://pgbrandsampler.ca" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pgbrandsampler.ca/pgeveryday.ca</a>), <a title="Johnson & Johnson" href="https://www.healthyessentials.ca" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">healthyessentials.ca</a>, <a href="http://www.samplesource.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">samplesource.com</a>, and of course in-store vendor samples</li>


</ul><h3>Group Buys</h3>


I skim through group buy deals (e.g. <a href="https://www.groupon.com/visitor_referral/h/f89503ee-4737-4e7e-a4aa-2680e60f1e10" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Groupon</a>, Living Social, WagJag) for hair care and restaurant options, since we go out to eat pretty often.


<ul><li><em><strong>Tip:</strong></em> If you use multiple group buy sites, keep track of all your buys and expiry dates on a calendar (e.g. Google calendar)</li>


</ul><hr>

</p><li>rice and barley cereals</li>


    

<li>avocado</li>


    

<li>bananas</li>


    

<li>carrots</li>


    

<li>sweet potato</li>


    

<li>beets</li>


    

<li>apple</li>


    

<li>red swiss chard</li>


    

<li>spinach</li>


    

<li>kale</li>


    

<li>rice puffs</li>


    

<li>corn puff crackers</li>


    

<li>a couple bites of a slice of orange</li>





What surprised us was that she seemed to really like kale and swiss chard! She couldn’t get enough (or we just don’t feed her fast enough): she just kept opening her mouth to signal, “I want more!”
Sometimes I think we’re doing a hybrid model of baby-led weaning and pureed/mashed foods. I try to give her soft foods in hopes that she will self-feed, but instead, she happily mushes the bananas and the avocado in her finger, and takes the corn puff cracker and smash it into pieces; she will, however, eat them from my hands or from a spoon, or from her hand once we place a piece of the cracker into her mouth and guide her hand to hold the rest. The purees we feed her is more lumpy than smooth, and I actually find that she seems more willing to eat chicken when fed to her in chunks or shreds. If using only one hand at the table is an early sign of what could be her dominant hand, we think that she may be right-handed (her left leg also gets stuck too when she tries to move from sitting to tummy).
What to try next?
Broccoli perhaps, and  white fish is certainly on the let’s-venture-outside-of-the-fruit-veggies horizon.]]>

</p><ol><li>Gift Registries
If you are considering signing up for a baby gift registry, there are a couple of options:


<ul><li>Babies “R” Us: upon placing a few items on the registry <em>in store</em>, a bag of freebies/samples and coupons will be given to you. If I remember correctly, a 0-6 mo pacifier was in mine, and a BPA free bottle (which we didn’t really like – we preferred the Avent bottles in the end). <del>If you deliver on your submitted expected date (or your guess), they will give you a gift as well</del>.</li>


    

<li> Sears: apparently, if purchases are made from your registry with them, and <a href="http://her.happyhippos.ca/2013/07/baby-predictions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">if you guess the correct date of the baby’s arrival</a>, then <a href="http://www.giftregistry.sears.ca/gift/egrWgEn.jsp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">you get credit back for those purchases</a>. I didn’t know about this, or else I may have benefitted 🙂</li>


</ul></li>


    

<li>Work Benefits


<ul><li>Employee Assistant Programs: Through my employer’s employee assistance program, we got 3 books (A What to Expect book, a year one book for Daddy, and a board book), a Baby Einstein lullaby CD, <a href="http://www.snugglebugz.ca/baby-whoozit.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a mini Whoozit toy</a>, and some other generic literature</li>


    

<li>Health insurance and fitness credits: this covered a private ward for recovery after delivery, and also allowed me to buy a jogging stroller as well as a breast pump</li>


</ul></li>


    

<li>Brands
Even though you may plan to breastfeed exclusively, you might need formula as emergency supply or even to give away to other expectant/new moms since formula actually costs a fair bit!


<ul><li><a href="https://www.startwell.nestle.ca/en/user/register" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nestle Baby</a>: you need to select that you plan to formula feed to get the backpack with change pad I’ve been told, some formula, and maybe a bottle?</li>


    

<li>Enfamil: formula</li>


    

<li>Johnson & Johnson used to give out a free travel pack of baby products if you request it from their contact form, but when I did, they sent me a voucher to claim one in store <del>(which I haven’t found a place that carries them yet), and when my sister inquired, she was just directed to healthyessentials.ca to request non-baby related samples</del>. You can now sign up for an account at <a href="http://www.healthyessentials.ca" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">healthyessentials.ca</a>, fill out your profile to say when you’re expecting and they will automatically give you a form to fill out so that they can send you the the voucher.</li>


</ul></li>


    

<li>Stores


<ul><li><del>Shoppers Drug Mart: VIB – free pack of diapers (I actually received two, but it could be because the fine print said offer valid until Dec 31, 2012 so I emailed them about it; my sister only got a coupon for diapers, I think), a baby bib, and coupons for 1000 Optimum points for buying various products, like baby Tylenol, diapers, drinks and snacks. Be sure to opt in on Optimum emails as they seem to send diaper coupons every so often (my sister has gotten $8 off any size pack of diapers and some other freebie).</del> <strong>Update:</strong> they discontinued the program sometime near the end of 2016.</li>


    

<li><a href="http://www.sobeyspharmacy.com/bbh" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sobeys Baby Be Healthy</a>: free monthly vitamins up to a year (you just need to go once a month), reuseable bag, a couple of Size 2 Compliments brand diapers<del> – these perks may only be given to you if you sign up in store (at the pharmacy)
</del>Update: I was able to sign up online and get a small gift bag in store, and this time it contained a package of Huggies Little Snugglers newborn diapers!</li>


    

<li>Thyme Maternity: they may be affiliated with the Nestle program, but when I went on <a title="It’s about Thyme" href="http://her.happyhippos.ca/2013/05/its-about-thyme/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Customer Appreciation Day</a>, I think I got more than the standard package. Signing up to receive their emails will also alert you when they have a 1-item 50% off coupons.</li>


    

<li>Speaking of stores, if you’re already shopping for baby items online, some stores have referral codes so that you can get a new member discount (search on <a href="http://retailmenot.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">retailmenot.com</a> for online stores), or 5% off items that you have put in your cart but abandoned mid-transaction for whatever reason (e.g. Snugglebugz.ca). Oh, and be on the lookout for diaper coupons in newspaper flyer inserts like Redplum or P&G, or online through sites like websaver.ca or P&G (can’t remember if it was brandsampler.ca or brandsaver.ca) and remember to price it per diaper to see whether is sale is actually a good deal since each store has their own count of diapers per box (<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AoVtPmnZqKqFdEEzWk1zU01WX0Q2OWpMenVEeTZQd2c&usp=drive_web#gid=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a handy spreadsheet helped me keep a tally</a>)</li>


    

<li>For those out west, <a href="http://www.londondrugs.com/Baby-Welcome-Package/baby-pkg%2Cdefault%2Cpg.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">London Drugs</a> has a sign-up form that you can complete to get a package in-store (or shipped free with $200+ purchase).</li>


</ul></li>


    

<li>Region’s resources


<ul><li>Our city’s library has a partnership with Zinio and <a href="https://www.rbdigital.com/kitcheneron/service/zinio/landing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">allows you to download magazines to keep</a>. They used to offer Today’s Parent, but now they have <a href="http://www.ecoparent.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">EcoParent</a> and Birthing magazines. One branch has a toy lending library that even allows you to borrow toys for free! (You can also get Today’s Parent for $1 an issue that’s mailed to your home if you’re an existing Rogers or Fido customer)</li>


    

<li>The Region of Waterloo has a <a href="http://chd.region.waterloo.on.ca/en/childFamilyHealth/Online-Prenatal-Program.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">free online prenatal program</a>. While I found in-class sessions helpful for answering questions and hands-on practice (e.g. massage techniques), this seems like a great refresher or prep resource.</li>


</ul></li>


    

<li>Midwife offices
And speaking of libraries, some midwife offices will have a lending library of books, DVDs, and even free samples from various companies (lansinoh/nipple and/or diaper rash cream, Today’s Parent magazines) or even an mommy-exchange box that may have gently used clothing for baby and mom-to-be!</li>


    

<li><strong>*Unverified*</strong> Baby Boxes: (<a href="https://babyboxcanada.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1</a>) and (<a href="http://www.babyboxco.com/blogs/news/all-about-ontario" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2</a>). Because my babies were born before these initiatives were offered, I don’t actually know if you will actually get a baby box; one of our friends did mention you have to complete a form and bring in a voucher to a physical place to get the box.</li>


</ol>


Once the baby is born, you may wish to join free programs like (note: these examples may be specific to my area):


<ol><li><a href="http://www.children.gov.on.ca/htdocs/English/topics/earlychildhood/oeyc/index.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Early Years Centres</a></li>


    

<li>Mom and baby programs or support groups, either through local <a href="http://on.evanced.info/kpl/lib/eventcalendar.asp?Lib=All" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">libraries</a>, churches (e.g. <a href="http://www.mops.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MOPS</a> or our local Salvation Army’s <a href="http://www.sapcrc.com/programs.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Parent-Child Resource Centre</a>) or find meetings or activities online, such as Life With A Baby (LWAB) or <a href="http://www.lllc.ca/lllc-kitchenerwaterloo-wednesday-pm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">La Leche League</a> (LLLC for breastfeeding support)</li>


</ol>


Other moms, did I forget anything? I’ll try to keep this list updated if anything new pops up.
