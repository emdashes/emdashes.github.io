		<p>				Saffron Passionfruit White Chocolate Ice Cream at Xococava <br>(St. Clair area in Toronto)


<a href="http://twitpic.com/2aiwug" title="the saffron passionfruit white chocolate ice cream from xococ... on Twitpic"><img src="http://twitpic.com/show/thumb/2aiwug.jpg" width="160" height="180" alt="the saffron passionfruit white chocolate ice cream from xococ... on Twitpic"></a><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aimeili/4847408305/" title="IMG_5049 by b.p., on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4128/4847408305_2287333032_m.jpg" width="240" height="180" alt="IMG_5049"></a>
The smoothness and “round” texture and taste of the passionfruit really gave it a fresh feel to it and would easily be my favourite ice cream here (maybe on par with Berthillon in Paris)


</p><h3>Earl Grey cake at La Bambouche in Toronto</h3>


<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aimeili/4735931924/" title="IMG_4770 by b.p., on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4139/4735931924_952d25a374.jpg" width="400" height="300" alt="IMG_4770"></a>
At $4.75 a slice, it seems a little pricey, but the smooth texture, great tea taste, and it being not too sweet just hits the spot. This cake, along with the green tea cake at Yogi Berry (on Yonge Street in North York) are my two choices.


<h3>Bread and Bretzel</h3>


Upon stumbling on a local food blogger, <a href="http://congeeyouremybaby.blogspot.com/2010_02_01_archive.html">Congee, You’re My Baby</a>‘s post about the availability of fresh egg tarts from a local bakery, I’ve been visiting Bread and Bretzel to sample an assortment of Chinese baked goods. Part of the mystery of this bakery is that they have a German facade and you really have to ask them what they have in terms of the Chinese buns and no-fixed prices. The first time, I received 6 coconut buns for $2. Upon inquiring about egg tarts, they suggested I call in, so they baked me a fresh dozen for $5 (at which point, the older lady seemed to disapprove the price he charged me). This time, I got 6 red bean buns for $5. When remarking that he charged me $2 last time, the answer was that because they were end-of-day bread (which seemed reasonable since I just showed up and asked what they had left). It’s too bad that only the coconut buns are half decent; the egg tarts uses typical tart shells (not egg tart pastry shells) and the red bean buns lack filling and are slightly too sweet. Perhaps I should visit St. Jacob’s market just to see what they sell there (and to get a better feel for the actual prices).


<h3>Cold Stone Creamery</h3>


<a href="http://elenawang.blogspot.com/2010/07/grace-ice-cream.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Elena’s recent post</a> prompted me to share about my unintended visit to Tim Horton’s in Cambridge. Every time I visit this Tim Hortons, it’s because I’m early for an appointment in the plaza behind it. This time, I noticed that it had a Cold Stone Creamery inside! Not only does this Tim Hortons have a Cold Stone Creamery, it serves CHEDDAR cheese bagels! Ever since noticing that Timmy’s don’t carry the sun-dried tomato bagels anymore, I have had yet to find a better alternative, until this visit to Tim Hortons.
And because I had time to linger, I decided to ask about the prices of the ice cream, since I could not see the prices posted anywhere! The first lady I asked didn’t know, so she had to ring one up to find out. But that seemed a hassle, so I got up and asked the manager for the prices, but the answer was more along the lines of “it depends” (on what you get).
So, I sat down and started working, reviewing a coworker’s wireframes, and the manager wanders over and asks if he answered my questions sufficiently. He had noticed that I was writing notes and wonders if I was a mystery shopper! I wasn’t, but I sure wanted to chat more about the ice cream – turns out, the prices don’t show on the LCD menus until after breakfast (who would want ice cream for breakfast? :P), that each additional topping costs about $0.75 if you don’t go for a signature feature, and that his personal choice (even before thinking of adding Cold Stone Creamery into his Tim Hortons) for quality is that Cold Stone Creamery seems to be better than Marble Slab (<a href="http://elenawang.blogspot.com/2010/07/grace-ice-cream.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Elena’s post seems to confirm that as well</a>). He also told me where there was one in Kitchener, and printed out a sample receipt for me to compare it to Marble Slab prices (not with the coupons though!). I didn’t buy any, nor did he offer me a sample to try that day, but now at least I know that Cold Stone offers a birthday club so I will try it then!]]>

		<p>				The <a href="http://insidevancouver.ca/2010/07/01/an-ode-to-white-spot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Inside Vancouver blog</a> featured an entry about White Spot recently.  Reading through this article, I was reminded that White Spot was very much a part of my childhood: my father was the (General?) Manager at various White Spot locations across the Lower Mainland and thus, White Spot was a familiar reference in our household.</p>




<p>Though I recently discovered that very few locations have the carhop option still available (sad!), White Spot wasn’t just about the food or the dining experience.  In fact, despite liking the key-lime pie, strawberry tart, drinks that had grenadine in it {what must have been a shirley temple}, pirate paks and the very chocolate ice cream (and the toys: playmobil pirates and dinosaurs), and zoo sticks and mushroom caps, we had more than a few too many meals at White Spot.</p>




<p>But, I have memories beyond the food: our kindergarten class was given a kitchen tour of White Spot;  my Holly Hobbie doll, Pam Pam was named by a White Spot employee (named after another employee), and we even ended up with White Spot memorabilia:  strawberry towels, the legendary t-shirt (like the one on <a href="http://insidevancouver.ca/2010/07/01/an-ode-to-white-spot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Inside Vancouver</a>), old paper placemats, mugs, and even their radio commercials with their jingle on cassette.  White Spot also had Christmas parties for staff and their families, with Santa Claus (and toys from Santa!) in good times and in leaner times, weathered through a strike.</p>




<p>Since then, White Spot has become almost something entirely different – with new menu items, redone interiors, the disappearance of the drive-in option in many locations, and new Triple-O fast food counters at gas stations and food courts, but it’s definitely a nice reminder of home. </p>

</p><li>Crawl under the desk facing away from the window, facing the floor with our hands interlinked around our necks – this is to protect yourself from falling bits</li>




<li>Count to 30</li>




<li>and if the quaking stops by then, to evacuate the building – in case of an aftershock</li>





If a desk or table wasn’t available, we were advised to find a door frame, as that should be the strongest part of the building. In high school, I often encountered somebody else’s dried up gum under the tables, which was pretty gross.
At the time of the 5.0 earthquake last week, I was in my chair thinking that I was really cold, so I got up. When I stood up to get my jacket, I noticed that my coworker was looking at me funny. Turns out, he thought I was rocking my chair so hard that he felt the vibrations when in fact it was the earthquake. Strangely enough, neither I nor my other coworker felt a thing, but sure enough, immediately after, twitter confirmed it with over 1,500 tweets!
j.w calls and the first thing he says is not “are you okay?” or “did you feel it?” but “I lied.” About what? Turns out Ontario DOES have earthquakes and is on a plate near a fault line too (just not as massive as BC I guess).
When people start to exchange stories about where they were when it happened, it’s a good sign because it just means that God’s protection were over the people. I found it especially funny to hear that some parliament members scrambled under their desks, while others tried to exit: just separates those who have had earthquake “training” from those who aren’t from earthquake prone areas. But in a situation where one is on a higher level, are you supposed to duck or flee?

		<p>				I am very much a believer that service makes or breaks a good dining experience. In fact, I would argue that whether you have good or bad food, the service contributes to the overall impression of the restaurant and would be a factor in deciding whether one would return again.</p>




<h3>The Bauer Kitchen</h3>




<p><a href="http://twitpic.com/17txh9" title="First time at the Bauer Kitchen. Also first time having calam... on Twitpic"><img src="http://twitpic.com/show/thumb/17txh9.jpg" width="150" height="150" alt="First time at the Bauer Kitchen. Also first time having calamari... on Twitpic" align="right"></a>For example, take <a href="http://www.charcoalgroup.ca/main8.cfm">The Bauer Kitchen</a>: we had our first visit back in March. The food was good (at least the gnocchi and the calamari was – I can’t remember what I had!), but what made it stand out in our books is the excellent service when it came to correcting a mistake and making it right.</p>




<p>Simply put, TBK messed up: the tip of their olive oil bottle had ended up in j.w’s dish. Some of you may be shaking your head and saying that this is unacceptable for this type of a restaurant, but we understand that accidents do happen.</p>




<p>
Not only had the server apologized, she went to the kitchen to identify it. Then, she returned with the manager, who too apologized, explained what it was/where it came from, asked if j.w was okay, took the dish off our bill, plus offered dessert on the house (for the both of us)!</p>




<p>So, despite the incident, what could have been a very unpleasant experience has left us very impressed at the service and we have recommended this restaurant to others as a result (especially since the food itself was pretty good). It’s also on our list of revisits.</p>




<h3>The 41</h3>




<p>On the other hand, another new restaurant in town, The 41 Gastropub leaves much to be desired. The menu has some interesting choices, prices are moderate, and the food is okay: a tad salty the first time, but we decided to give it a second chance earlier this week. And, well, maybe it’s the name “pub” that let’s them get away with it, or maybe it’s just the server (we had her twice), but she gives the impression that she doesn’t want to be there. Not only do we have to ask for the weekday feature (not on the menu), I caught her checking her phone at the bar during this and our first meal (maybe she’s tweeting on @thefortyone account?!) but that signaled to me that she was bored. What surprised me is that when I told her that I found (chewed on) a piece of string in my half-eaten pork and pineapple taco, she responded with “[eew] gross” and promptly dropped it on the floor. Seriously?! That’s all? no apology, no “would you like another one?” (until j.w prompted and asked me whether I wanted another) or “let me find out what that is…” – at least take the piece of string with you and discard it when your customers aren’t looking.</p>




<p>So, as good as the marketing and social media channels are, we are hugely disappointed and will likely visit somewhere else next time.</p>




<p>It’s funny, because if this happened at an Asian restaurant, we wouldn’t be impressed, but we’d only be surprised if they apologize or make up for it in other ways. Like when I found a piece of metal scouring pad in my pho, or a soggy clothesline peg in our veggies and nothing was really done about it….maybe it’s the whole mentality that cheaper places simply don’t care.</p>

		<p>				So by now, people are laughing at me for watching too much TV or thinking that the mysterious box outside my house was a possible bomb. And, as a result, bent my garage door and shattered a pane of glass.</p>




<p>On Friday night, I came home and biked over to a friend’s to feed their chinchillas. However, when I got there, I stupidly realized that I forgot their key, so I tried to call j.w to see if he was on his way home so that he could bring his key over. Of course, he didn’t have his phone with him, and of course, he wouldn’t show up until after 1:30 AM.</p>




<p>So just as I was about to get home, I passed by this plastic box that had cables coming out from it, locked in chains. I had never seen a traffic counter before, but that’s where Facebook came in and my friends helped identify it. Before I had thought to take a photo, I decided that I should notify the local police.</p>




<p>I figured that the police might want me to stay at my location while I called, so I parked my bike behind my car in the garage instead of leaving it out (which I would’ve done if it was just to grab a key) where it could be stolen. But, in my haste to get inside (to safety), I didn’t realize the handle bar hadn’t completely cleared the path of the garage door. All I heard as I was about to go in was loud screeching and crunching noises, and glass shattering everywhere!</p>




<p>At first, I thought it was my taillights, but then I saw the garage door was bending and one of its window panes was broken (must have been the pressure trying to escape). I was amazed that the door didn’t reverse its course or stop and continued to go down until I pressed the button again! (the first time I had dialed my friend’s number in Toronto, as I thought my cell phone was my garage remote). I also discovered that once you stop the garage door, if you press the button again, it continues its course instead of reversing it.</p>




<p>Some help they were: I called the local line, and when I mentioned “strange box”, she immediately transfered me to dispatch. Dispatch couldn’t really understand my description and didn’t accept my offer to email a photo to them. Instead, she told me that she would send a cruiser by when they weren’t busy to check it out, which could take anywhere from 10 minutes to 3 hours for example.</p>




<p>Surprisingly, my bike was still in good shape (despite my garage door taking the damage), so I hightailed to my friend’s and spent a few hours there until j.w came home and told me matter-of-factly, “it says PeekTraffic on it.”</p>




<p>(in the daylight, I can also see big red letters that say DANGER and in small print, “City of Kitchener”. Thanks for the scare, City of Kitchener (which resulting in damaging my garage door)</p>

		<p>				Thanks to RSS feeds from sites like RedFlagDeals.com and SimplyFrugal.ca (from BC – dare I guess, Surrey?), I get notified of deals, coupons, and freebies. As a good practice, I generally sign up for freebies using a junk email address so that I don’t risk getting spam in my personal account. Earlier this month, I learned that this is one practice that I recommend all of you to adopt if you don’t already. Why?</p>




<p>For example, some companies send you freebies or discounts around the time of your birthday in exchange for your personal information, like your email address. Most privacy policy around giving information would read something like,


</p><blockquote>“So rest assured, any information you share with us, from your email address to your favorite flavor, will be carefully guarded through our use of industry-standard security software to encrypt your credit card number, ordering and shipping information and other personal information.”</blockquote>






<p>However…!</p>




<p>I’m not so sure that my email address is safe anymore. In my frustration of not being able to reprint a coupon (because it was cut off the first time), I tried to see if there were ways to disable or get around the print restriction (javascript, I surmised). Not only did I accidentally discover that I could access someone else’s coupon, but when I looked at the source code, I was able to see that person’s email address too! Wow, I didn’t expect to see someone else’s personal information so easily.</p>




<p>I had tried to contact the company to alert them of this through their contact form, but they didn’t respond and when I finally got a hold of them through the phone, they couldn’t promise that they would tell me when it was fixed. However, as I write this entry, they seem to have done something since the URL doesn’t work anymore.</p>




<p>So dear readers, be careful with your personal information. I’m not saying that you don’t give any of it away (some may be public already) but just know that there is that risk.</p>




<p><i>Also, if you actually Google that disclaimer (like I just did), it’s really funny because three different companies in the same food services space uses it! You can probably guess who copied whom.</i></p>

		<p>				I remember the last time I flew back for four days to attend a wedding, I told myself not to do that again. Well, I did it again (do I not learn?).</p>




<p>And within a span of 5 months, Vancouver has changed so much: the Canada Line has finished, Shiro on Cambie has closed, they changed the traffic patterns, and there is just so much traffic everywhere (and at all times of the day)! I find that I can’t follow landmarks anymore such as knowing when to turn on Pinetree Way (onto David) because of the giant 4-way stop, but now it’s a traffic light. Road work is ongoing as well: I feel like I’m on a narrower bridge because Port Mann now has medians and other tall fences due to the construction of a second bridge. Everything feels so far away as well –  20km takes 40 mins to drive!</p>




<p>Alas, this trip has made me realize that I don’t think I would want to move back despite my love for my family, friends, the mild climate, the water and the mountains. Sadly, I wouldn’t be able to afford living in greater Vancouver, even if I did get over the traffic issue (*shudders* to think that it reminds me more of Toronto now); the cost of living is just too steep.  The housing market and gas prices are much higher than what I see over here, and yet, BC’s minimum wage is only $8.00/hour ($6 if you’re entry level) – <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_minimum_wages_in_Canada">this is the lowest in Canada</a> (Ontario has the highest at $10.25/hr). Annual salaries can’t be that much higher in BC than what we have over here! In comparison, I feel very rich where I am now. Even if I did live in Surrey or Langley, I’d quickly lose money if they do implement the $3 one-way toll to travel across the Port Mann Bridge once it is twinned (now here’s an idea: HOV lane users should be free – that would encourage carpooling!).</p>




<p>I miss the ocean, mountains and tall evergreens, but we do have a few things like the annual fall leaves that colour the horizons. Despite all these changes, the one thing that hasn’t changed: my friends are still my friends, and as kind as I remember them! 🙂 (e.g. waking up earlier and meeting for breakfast. Chewie even crossed the Fraser River, picked me up, and drove me to meet up with Boy+family!)</p>




<p>By the way, congratulations <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aimeili/sets/72157624020849607/detail">Miche+Tunger</a>!</p>

		<p>				all characters mentioned in this post are coincidental and do not represent any factual events in reality…now that I am aware of anyway. this is my dream blog
I hadn’t seen them in a very long time, but when I did see Trunkit, I was very saddened to hear that she and Brassman327 had a falling out, and that they ended up becoming divorced. It turned out that ever since I seen them in Ottawa, things got worse and worse. Even sadder was that everyone stopped talking to Brassman327 – at least from the girls’ perspective. Poor him.


</p><hr>
I went out, intended to go farther, but because I was running short on time, I decided to sign up for a play. Actually, there were only 8 people who did – 4 girls, and 4 guys. When I bought the pass, which were bought from people in costumes, I didn’t realize that this was for an interactive play. That meant that you were paired with one person of the opposite gender and you actively participated in an improvised play. Each participant was given a story, with lines that the characters need to achieve. For example, the first objective could be: wake up and make breakfast. In the play, you and your partner would say lines and do things on the set to get to that scene before being able to advance to the next objective. In the end, the play would finish when you got to the end of the objectives. So you get to see the story as well as participate in the plot line. And, as much as I don’t like performing publicly (despite me enjoying it very much as a child), it was a really fun experience and a very good idea…]]>
