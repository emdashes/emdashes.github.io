Anyhow, going back to West Nile. Within 2 hours, Steve and I both got 1 bite on our arms. Fortunately, he was wearing pants whereas I also was a feast for those mosquitoes in my shorts.  Steveo and I went to Laurel Creek Conversation…er, Conservation Area yesterday just to wander around and to see if we could find any beavers (according to PT there are beavers there). And since I’m relocating again in a week, Laurel Creek would not be as easy to access from my “new” place. In my 5 years here, this is only my first time entering this site legally (the first being in the middle of the night to watch shooting stars); we entered via the main entrance and so the park rangers charged us a $3.75/person fee. For a forested area in the middle of modern civilization (in an urban area), the smell of pine and the sounds of nature sure make you almost feel like you’re not in Waterloo anymore (just don’t look beyond the tops of the tall trees to see the radio/cell-phone towers). I think it’s a nice area to camp minus the mosquitoes–it has a sanded beach with a swimming area, boat launch/docking area, 3 major trials…um trails, and tons of space. The only problem is that the map they provided us was the most vague map I’ve ever seen. The 3 major trails look like roads and the only “stated” hiking trail does not even exist in the summer–that’s what we tried to find, but apparently, after getting enough mosquito bites, I called it quits and on our way out, we inquired of the map only to learn that the “hiking” trail only exists when the reservoir is drained in the winter.
</p>



<p>
The <b>16</b> mosquito bites across my 2 legs are really starting to swell and have the numbing effect that I often experience when I am bit. Consequently, I can’t seem to walk very efficiently because my feet are painfully numb and itchy. The hydrocortisone cream that Jozie dropped off for me this morning isn’t working too well, and toothpaste doesn’t do the job either. I need ideas–how do you deal with mosquito bites?</p>

And although my bro doesn’t bother reading this, Happy 18th Berfday anyhow! And congrats to him since he got a $3500 scholarship to SFU CS (he’s still deciding on whether to do joint major/option with Software Eng, Bus Admin, or Info Sys — ppl have told him that Soft Eng won’t get you a job anywhere but I don’t know if I’d pick the other two either). I can’t believe he’s getting a car as a reward for getting 90%+ thereby resulting in an entrance scholarship — they’re looking at the RSX for him. (! knowing him, he’s not gonna let me drive it, but then again i’ll prolly not being driving the altima either !). a 90%+ average (excluding provincial exam marks but they generally don’t bring one down too much)? that’s insane…tho, it sucks b/c both my siblings are naturally smarter than i am. they don’t need to put in as much effort and they breeze right by, not to mention that they’re naturally more athlethic than i am as well. SS this week was about self-esteem and i think one of the only ppls that can affect my self-esteem negatively are my family members…oh wellz, i’m content since i can’t change anything anyhow :).

<p>
I shall now sit back and not think bout the burning itches I have on my legs…</p>

		<p>				<a href="http://www.findingnemo.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Finding Nemo</a>. The trailers looke really uninteresting, but the jokes sure make kids and adults laugh (trust me, my aunt saw it and she loved it). I personally enjoyed it (but not as much as Monsters Inc. and Toy Story), but I loved Squirt :).

Canada Day was something else in the Capital this year. I must say that God answers prayers :). After raining for 1 hr, the sky was clear and the fireworks were “da bomb” (no ‘pun intended’). I believe that this year totally beat out the previous year in terms of ooh-ahhing the crowd…well, not to mention that the weather was considerably cooler (24C) as the last (40C), but not as cold as the first year (6C) that I was there. I also met a cyber-girl in person at City-wide P&W night…one of Clarence’s friends, who’s ironically the younger sister of the 2 others that I already know! Went also on a double date w Sheree and Ma-Chiew to dinner and to Putting Edge–glow-in-the-dark mini golf. ‘Twas quite fun, and the food was definitely the best of the Thai restaurants I’ve tried in Ottawa (Siam Bistro); an excellent choice/recommendation by my supervisor at MOL last summer. At the restaurant, bumped into two of Aaron’s friends (Cheung and Sindy(?)…), of whom we also saw the next day at the celebrations (the probability of seeing 2 of the same people w/o intention in two days in a huge crowd is quite low i think). Ah yes, the dread of having 3 (or was it 4) buses ship us bodies to Ottawa from TO was quenched when they separated us according to destination and thereby skipping the unnecessary stops, cutting down 5h45 to 4h30 of travel time (arrival in OT: 4h30…yawn! bright and early enough to see the sunrise! Luckily my companion, Grace, of whom I met on the bus, or rather, she met me, kept me company–and vice versa). Rented <i>Catch Me if You Can</i> on DVD and I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed the film! Firstly, I’m not a huge fan of Leonardo Di Caprio, but he was good, and as well, I expected it to be an action film filled with violence instead of a drama, but I’m glad it wasn’t :). Marc concluded that based on the movie, “it <i>pays</i> to do crime”. As usual, pics from the weekend are here.</p>

Wow, last week the weather decided to pick up in terms of co-operating with “summer” and on Friday morning, I decided that since I would have a car in the afternoon, I walked to work. Amazing feat for myself since I don’t enjoy walking in the early morning (hiking is an entirely different story). Surprisingly enough, it only took me approximately 35 mins (as opposed to the estimate 45 mins, but it may be due to the sporadic jogs).  The week itself went by quite fast, to the point where I can’t remember what I did apart from working and spending evenings at home watching a couple of DVDs like <i>Billy Elliot</i> and <i>Rat Race</i> (don’t ask, there wasn’t much choice to choose from). On Monday evening though, Josie and She was going to meet up so P, Marcy, She and I were going to play badminton…’cept they were royally rejected. Thus, it so happened that P and She went to jog, and the time slot was exactly in my social dance class. Marcy ended up as my partner and well, it was quite challenging trying to follow a leader at a beginner’s level in an intermediate class :T. Next up was hip-hop = massive confusion; I’m falling behind. The dance routine is getting more challenging and well, “flirty” hahah :}
</p>



<p>
So extending this short post: We rented a car for the weekend and because they were out of intermediate class cars (Sunfire/Pontiacs), we were upgraded to a 2004 Toyota Corolla without additional costs (full size). Ah, I miss driving a Corolla (I practiced in that car)…one observation: I think Asian cars fit me more because when I drive them, I don’t haveta lean as far forward to see over the dashboard :). Originally, we were also going to stay at a hotel in Toronto for the night because we didn’t know where to crash. So, I proceeded to book a websaver reservation online with ichotelsgroup, the company who owns Holiday Inn (Express), Quality Inn, and other similar hotels with a deal for $87 a night. However, when I tried to cancel, it was headache upon headache. Customer service is poor and corporate policies seem to contradict each other; twas a mass mess and a complaint letter is in the works. Thus, finally after 5 phone calls, the final one began as such:
</p>



<p>
Me [to ‘Josephine’]: They’re [in reference to the people at HI and ICHOTELSGROUP] sooooo stoopid!!!<br>
Lady: Holiday Inn blah blah blah….Hello?!<br>
Me: OH! Sorry…[barely contains laughter and tries to explain situation with boughts of giggles mixed in]<br>
Lady: Excuse me, could you please repeat that? I couldn’t really hear you.<br>
Me: [Okay, straight face. Now if only Josie would stop laughing in the background]…
</p>



<p>
Thankfully, she was willing to cancel my reservation…thus, saving us $87 :). And our weekend began shortly after with our first stop to 360 for lunch (inclusive in our e-bay lion king tickets for $70 Row J48) along with view from the observatory decks (the glass floor slightly irked me for a bit…kinda like how the Lynn Valley suspension bridge did back when I was like 7 years old). The entire day consisted of long walking detours. Next stop (after a slight detour) was the Lion King. The first time, Ben took me to see it way back in Dec of 2000. The second time, the cast wasn’t as great (viz. young Simba), but the puns and dances were still lookin’ good!
</p>



<p>
After 5 years in Ontario, I can also finally say that I’ve been to the CN tower AND centre island! The Toronto Islands is like a huge park, which happened to be hosting the Dragonboast Fest that day so we caught some of that. Centreville, the l’il theme/amusement park reminds me of those in movies…quite quaint. Apparently, my sister isn’t into rides, my brother is way into rides, and I guess i’m just smack in the middle. The carousel just doesn’t look the same as it did when i was a kid…Dinner was at this overpriced (but mine was good) café-ish restaurant smack in the middle of the island. We also found a labryinth! =) i love those, cept the sawdust hurt my feet b/c I had heeled sandals on…we didn’t get a chance to see what the children’s fortress was…booo..
</p>



<p>
On the way back to the car, we encountered so much human traffic that made us realise that we were missing TO’s version of the Symphony of Fire. AGH, and we were just at the Harbourfront too! However, my feet were in no shape or form willing to walk all the way back to see them because they were in blistering pain from the huge detour we took to find the car. Took over 100 pics that day, some of which turned out really nice :).
</p>



<p>
On Sunday, we were supposed to go to the Casa Loma but by the time we finished church at NTCBC, lunch @ Starwalk with Jon and Jenn joining us, and PacMall and Fairview, Casa Loma was closing. Because I love any Science/Discovery Centre, I suggested going there instead. However, when we got there, they were about to close in 1/2 hr and they still wanted to charge us $14! 🙁 So, we just hung out at Chapters (bought a few books in the process) and had dinner at some weird phó place (weird being noodles were Wider than usual), then proceeded to drive home to conclude our weekend in TO.</p>

Other interesting observations and conversations caused me to finally retire to bed at 5:00AM, to only have to wake up at 8:45AM again and set out for Niagra Falls.

Being the designated navigator is really rough; especially when one is fighting sleep. However, because I’ve already had my head bitten off even for getting us to the right places in Nova Scotia, I’ve naturally assumed the position. Aside from the drive, the rest of the day was pretty eventful: lunch, the Falls w tons of pics and a ride on the Maid on the Mist, a walk over to New York (with much interrogation from the US side, especially for Marc’s case) to see the American Falls and the Harbour Seals that were outside of the Aquarium (free!), to Ripley’s Believe or Not! museum, to the Beef Baron for dinner, and finally, back to the Falls for the Lights show, cept the other 2 girls were freezing their butts off and the lights were changing at a snail’s pace, so we went back to the car and headed home. Now, I will attempt to upload those pics 🙂 (and finally get to my Sunday School prep).</p>

In the last year of my high school days (that seems like only yesterday) I tried out some “grass” that someone gave to me in a roll of tissue paper.  It was fun, and I flew around the school a few times.
</p>



<p>
<b>Note:</b> The above paragraph was completed by j.w.. He sounds like a certain Daniel Lee. And, to clarify, yes, I’ve eaten green grass before, but it wasn’t in a roll of tissue paper; it tastes like dirt. Speaking of sounding like someone, it’s not only rather weird to sound like someone, but also imagine having the same thought pattern as someone; it’s scary, but sometimes, it may turn out to be good…bwahahaha! :).

	Hello, I am currently sitting in b.p.’s office. =)  she has a nice, clickitey keyboard!  We’re watching super old videos from twenty years ago, and assessing if they should be thrown out or not.  What fun!  I had no idea that they had 3d graphics in 1989.  Very impressive.  I should be studying, but I’m not.  Instead, I’m listening to music and writing in this blog!
I think that old records of things are very important to keep, especially since they contain such useful information.  I just  attended a lecture in developmental psych about reading, and how reading ability is not a component of intelligence.  However, there is a vast external storehouse of information that is only availiable to us if we can and have the willingness to read, which will affect our response to various stimuli.  That’s why I keep trying to encourage my brother and my friends to read, because if people stop reading, they will lose access to this information, which was discovered by people much older and wiser than ourselves, freely availiable for the taking.

Now as I was saying, during my graduation ceremony in high school, we called that special day “commencement”. Commence, the root word of “commencement”, means a beginning or a start. I think I prefer that word over “convocation” because commencement, just like baptism, does not mark the end of a stage in life, but rather, a beginning of a new one. Well, here I am, at the beginning of a new stage in life–and, I can testify that it’s all because of God’s grace that I stand here today with a piece of paper that says I obtained my English degree with my CompSci Minor. Unbelievable; looking at the graduand list, there isn’t very many people (if at all) who freely chose to minor in CS. On the other hand, I actually survived (with the help of God and of the others that He sent around me) and in hindsight enjoyed the experience immensely (minus a few courses). Now, I can finally say that I am a partial geek, but I won’t :).

P, She, Marcy, Joz joined me @ King Street Trio (on University) for a combination of my berfday (w the live duo playing the berfday song) and graduation dinner. ‘Twas really good (as usual)…the dessert was especially delicious; the ice-cream ball was sooo smooth and just undescribably yummy! :9</p>

Today, I think I had another tiny glimpse of the sadness that Jesus must have felt when he was on earth with the people that knew him and his purpose, yet chose to “bury [his] father” or “say goodbye to [his] family” (Luke 9:59-61) instead. Like the parable he told about the sower and the seeds (Matthew 13:1-23; sermon topic of last Sunday) , I’m sure that he saw those that completely did not hear what he was trying to tell them, but took especially notice of those that once experienced the fulfilment but subsequently fell away (which echoes in Hebrews 6:4-6: “It is impossible for those who have once been enlightened, who have tasted the heavenly gift, who have shared in the Holy Spirit, who have tasted the goodness of the word of God and the powers of the coming age, if they fall away, to be brought back to repentance, because to their loss they are crucifying the Son of God all over again and subjecting him to public disgrace.”). One prime example would be his friend Judas; Jesus offered him a chance at least even up until the Last Supper, but sadly enough, not only would Judas betray his friend, but in his misery, commit suicide.

One of the instructors, Xiang (who was also my CS330 classmate), said some words that were quite powerful while he was trying to coach us with our steps on Wednesday. He said to the effect of: I’m not a Christian, but you guys are and it should reflect through your expression and attitude. Your heads should be tilted upward as if you’re looking towards the sun [Son? :P]. The most important thing to watch for is that you guys are together; you’re one unit. [end paraphrase].  Interestingly enough, that’s how it works with the body of Christ: we are one unit, looking out for another–working together to be the most effective.
</p>

Good news! My friend, Chris, who’s also one of the instructors for St. John’s Ambulance, offered to slot my sister into an earlier date for her first-aid course, so that she wouldn’t have an excuse to not come to my convocation if she was able to switch her departure date from Vancouver. And yep, there was availablity; thus, she’s all set! She’s coming in time for my convocation (haha, oddly enough, I’m all excited now)! I guess she’ll haveta be the rep for the family =).</p>
