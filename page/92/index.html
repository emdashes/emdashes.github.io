</p>



<p>
J-camp was surprisingly really fun. I had a great time gettin‚Äô to know some of the younger ‚Äòuns and well, they‚Äôre overall a very friendly and energetic bunch :). *sigh* reminds me of the good ‚Äòol, er, young days when I wouldn‚Äôt get tired‚Ä¶and stay up all night while the counsellors would retire early. The slightly unstructured schedule was very relaxing and comforting :). For my second time of tenting, it was a very good experience b/c I didn‚Äôt get a single mosquito bite, tho I think Danny suffered from quite a handful‚Ä¶
</p>



<p>
Throughout the weekend, I was exempt from dishes and cooking. Although I kinda felt bad at times for ditching my campers, I didn‚Äôt feel bad at the same time :P. Thanks for the yummy food (yes, better than expected‚Äìthanks to last year‚Äôs horror stories), and for cleaning up! The only reason why I had this privilege of not having to do anything, was apparently, on Saturday morning, I woke up to see people crawling on their hands and knees. Yes, it was a terribly funny sight‚Ä¶so amusing that I was gonna take a pic if not for the fact that they were searching for Joyce‚Äôs diamond ring w/in the blades of green grass‚Ä¶I recalled that at Children‚Äôs Camp once, a counsellor lost his set of keys in a patch of green and just couldn‚Äôt find it! He just knelt there on the spot, closed his eyes and prayed really hard and when he opened them, there they were, right in front of his knees! So anyhow, I remembered that story of faith, and just fired up a quick prayer to God with similar intentions, as I knew how frustating that must‚Äôve been to lose something of such sentimental and financial value. Shortly after, I kicked something and looked down. Thanks to God, it was a ring, <i>the</i> ring, after positive confirmation =).
</p>



<p>
Some of us were able to go canoeing too in the afternoon that day. Marc and I took an hour, Dan and Rita and one other (can‚Äôt remember who it was) went for the rest. After not canoeing since high school, I really enjoyed the opportunity to coast down the lake in appreciation of God‚Äôs creation :). The canoes however, were really um‚Ä¶not the type that I prefer or am useta. Instead of fibreglass, the canoe‚Äôs body was made from material similar to Fisher-Price indoor playground equipment and the seats were made to the bottom so the canoer wouldn‚Äôt be able to kneel instead of sitting (I find kneeling gives me more power).
The canoe seemed wider than normal but I guess it‚Äôs a good thing considering it would mean that it would be less likely that I‚Äôd fall into the water as I can‚Äôt swim.
</p>



<p>
That evening, the sky was really clear. A bunch of Jerms slept outside (or shall I say napped outside for 1-2 hrs) and I joined them for like the first 30 mins before going back to the tent after the bonfire. The bonfire was quite interesting; I haven‚Äôt been able to sing children‚Äôs songs with a bunch of older people for such a long time now ;). Anyhow, as we were star-gazing and figuring out which constellations were which, I ended up catching 3-4 shooting stars fire across the sky. Afterwards, I found out that it was the beginning of some meteorite thingy.
</p>



<p>
The speaker was really interesting too, though I can‚Äôt remember what he talked about. All i remember was that I was intently listening to what he was saying‚Ä¶heh.

</a><a href="http://community.webshots.com/album/47487262WzUzZX" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Weekend Pix</a>.
</p>



<p>
If you notice, I only posted twice in August. One of the reasons is because right before the weekend of TJ/Daniel‚Äôs wedding, my work term was quickly coming to a close. Most of the time was spent either packing to move my stuff outta my house or OT (w/o pay) at the office to finish our report and presentation material for the Friday. Thankfully, the presentation and report went well and the director was impressed =). That concludes my term as a civil servant; quite an interesting one indeed.
</p>



<p>
Anyhow, the weekend was spent in TO and Derrick and his family was kind enough to offer their home during our stay there. TJ and Daniel <i>finally</i> tied the knot at Logos (Chinese) Baptist Church on Saturday afternoon. The ceremony was very comforting as it‚Äôs more often a solemn ceremony than one at ease. This time, the bride and groom and other members of the wedding party exchanged whispers here and there, and Pastor Tim gave a very amusing but good exhortation/blessing.
</p>



<p>
For the life of me, I can‚Äôt remember what we did in the afternoon. The reception/banquet was held at Celestial Court in Market Village. Chines food (8-10 courses) was very yummy and about 16 tables of guests (8-10) showed. Fortunately, Dave Chai (from Montr√©al/UW alumni) sat at our table, as I didn‚Äôt know any of the other guests (altho both of TJ‚Äôs ex housemates were there too :P).
</p>



<p>
Jen and Cal met up with us afterwards for a bubbletea at MetroSquare. Unfortunately, I won‚Äôt be able to see Jen as much anymore as she‚Äôs heading down to Boston(?) for more schooling. Congrats to her as she‚Äôs been accepted into the School of Optometry there! üôÇ
</p>



<p>
Worship at RHCBC (thanks Rice) was a very interesting one as well. There are a LOT of youth there and Pastor Herman‚Äôs sermon was a very good one. He‚Äôs a very good speaker especially when he doesn‚Äôt need to refer to any notes and interacts w the ‚Äúaudience‚Äù by actually moving through the aisles. The sermon was on Worship and one truth I retained was that worship isn‚Äôt worship unless it‚Äôs life-changing. How powerful, true, and yet, challenging! O led Sunday School and it was informative, esp on biblical history.
</p>



<p>
Lunch w Rice and DD at Jap restaurant. Pretty yummy and way better deal than Sakura Island in the ‚Äòloo‚Ä¶</p>

<a name="Trip">
</a>Road Trip Pix.
</p>



<p>
<i>Aug 24, 2002</i><br>
I now know why I useta keep a record of my trips. I don‚Äôt remember where exactly we went anymore. Boo. Anyhow, we started off our road trip at about 6:30 am (or perhaps even earlier) and drove down to the border in this really uncomfortable Alero (Oldsmobile) (and not very powerful either). I was stuck in the middle for the most part of the first lag of the trip to the point where my tailbone (whiplash permanent damages) began to complain of pain again. We stopped for lunch someplace ‚Äî think maybe it was near Oregon U‚Ä¶as we drove past Portland‚Äôs chinatown. Along the way, we stopped at a factory outlet and because the CK store was closing, bought some pants for a mere $12.50 CDN, a shirt at Banana Republic and some others at Gap Factory Store.
</p>



<p>
On the first night after a dinner in some hick town (where we got paranoid b/c some guy asked us if we were from out-of-town and if we knew were the police station was), we stayed at a Holiday Inn Express in Grant‚Äôs Pass, Oregon. My brother complained b/c there was not an indoor pool. However, this room was a suite-style so we escaped from my dad‚Äôs snoring :P. The beds were also queen-sized, which meant that my sister didn‚Äôt complain of me kicking her and hoggin all the blanket and shoving her to the edge of the bed (unlike the other nights).
</p>



<p>
<i>Aug 25, 2002</i><br>
In the morning, we were late gettin‚Äô out and thus, missed church. Not that there were many churches to choose from mind you‚Ä¶However, we did go to Oregon Caves and participated in a tour that lasted approximately 75 minutes. The caves averaged to about 5C but we were equipped with light jackets to keep warm :).
</p>



<p>
Driving to Crescent City took awhile, but we managed to arrive at the small town (with beautiful scenery!) and had seafood for dinner at AppleBee‚Äôs (some chain restaurant). The hotel (Anchorage Inn?) we stayed at really lacked in quality. Although it‚Äôs noteably the ‚Äúnewest‚Äù hotel in town, the rooms were dirty, the furniture used, and the service was really poor.
</p>



<p>
<i>Aug 26,2002</i><br>
On our way to San Fransisco, California, we drove through <a href="http://www.nps.gov/redw/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Redwood National Park</a> and through some massively tall and huge redwood trees. Kinda like Stanley Park but much vaster in the sheer numbers of trees. Tons of Oxygen there i suppose :P. We inched our car ‚Äúbackwards‚Äù through the drive-thru shrine tree, which is this massively tall tree that has a hole in the middle of it. 3/4 of this tree is dead but 1/4 of it still continues to grow. For dinner that night, we stopped along the way at a steakhouse called Cowboy‚Äôs or something like that. As I‚Äôm not too into steak, I only say that it was decent, tho my family liked it.
</p>



<p>
By the time we arrived in SF, it was dark so we checked in the Holiday Inn (<a href="http://www.basshotels.com/holiday-inn?_franchisee=SFOGG" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Golden Gateway</a>‚Äìtho I don‚Äôt remember it lookin‚Äô quite like the picture does), it actually sleeps better than Delta Hotels, though Delta has a nicer balcony view. This one lacked a balcony even tho we were on the 22nd floor (or something?).
</p>



<p>
<i>Aug 27,2002</i><br>
*yawn!*, apparently I kept kicking my sister in my sleep and hoggin‚Äô all the blanket :). heh‚Ä¶anyhow, took the street cable car to the cable car museum (and place where they run the cables). I never knew that it was the cable <i>underneath</i> the cars that pull them along. For lunch, we had a meal at IHOP, then browsed on Pier 51 (or was it 39‚Äìone of them is Fisherman‚Äôs Wharf) and took some pics and then I forgot what we did for the rest of the day. Agh. Must‚Äôve been unimportant. But it‚Äôs still buggin‚Äô me‚Ä¶oh! we might‚Äôve gone shopping at the Espirit store, which was closing; it was its last day in business in all of SF. Thus, when we got there, everything was 75% off, and then just as they were goin‚Äô to close, they announced <i>everything</i> was $2.00 USD üôÇ (so works out to be 3 bucks CDN!). Even though they did not have a fitting room (which they sold as well), I managed to grab at least 4 skirts (same cut, different design), flowery capris (i hate capris but since they were 2 dollars, i can use them in the house), and maybe something else, but I can‚Äôt remember what. =). This is all thanks to my bro who reaped the intent of street flyer advertising. dinner‚Ä¶what did we eat‚Ä¶er‚Ä¶??? OHOH, I don‚Äôt remember if it was this day or the next, but we visited SF‚Äôs downtown, which reminds me of NYC b/c of all these really big-name stores, and had cheesecake (YUMS! I had the keylime one) at the famous <a href="http://www.thecheesecakefactory.com/" target="_new" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cheesecake Factory</a>‚Äìpricey, but worth it! üôÇ My mom had the firecracker salmon rolls, a very yummy appetizer too, along w some really yummy iced mango drink! Tho‚Äô a late afternoon snack, we had Costco hotdogs for a light dinner‚Äìto balance everything. At Costco, I picked up a 128MB SMcard for my dig cam for a mere $75CDN! ;).</p>



<p>
<i>Aug 28,2002</i><br>
Good mornin‚Äô! Cable car-ed to Pier 39 (Fisherman‚Äôs Wharf), and took the Ferry to Alcatraz Island (home to the movie, <i>The Rock</i>). I was skeptical at first about the quality of an self-audio tour, but the recorded tour was very detailed‚Äìalong w sound effects, and testimonials from ex-convicts and wardens. Very well done! Apparently, it‚Äôs award-winning. However, advice to future tourists, the place is sooo cold and windy; I was afraid i‚Äôd get sick! Thankfully I didn‚Äôt and lived to eat the food in SF‚Äôs Chinatown. Apparently, the restaurant we picked was a good one (<i>X and Y‚Äôs Lounge</i>‚ÄìX and Y being arbitrary b/c I can‚Äôt remember what it‚Äôs called)‚Äìthe food tasted good and many ppl came and went. However, I think some of us had a stomach rxn to it anyhow. Ate in the afternoon at a seafood restaurant in Fisherman‚Äôs Wharf. The manager there was extremely nice; after my bro complained that his plate of food was too cold, the dessert (two as it‚Äôs equiv to price of the meal) was on the house :).
</p>



<p>
<i>Aug 29,2002</i><br>
Off to Oregon Coast! As we headed back home, we stopped along the Coast for some dune buggyin‚Äô. The sand was sooo beautiful as it reflected from the sun. The sand is soo fine and soft there too (my feet just sank in the sand)! What a ride! Instead of steering our own buggy‚Äôs (which would‚Äôve prolly been fun as well), we opted to take a guided thrill ride, where the buggy sat 6 of us, and the driver would steer us up and down, to the max of 35MPH or slightly over. Apparently, my dad wasn‚Äôt too thrilled as it felt like a 30 min coaster ride‚Ä¶*grins*. I definitely recommend it, and since we were in a 4-pt harness, there isn‚Äôt too much to worry about. The driver does this for the summer and allegedly gets paid $9.00/hr USD plus tips to do this every day :). How fun (tho I think that would be ‚Äútai chi gik‚Äù for me). We continued driving until we hit a Fred Meyer‚Äôs to eat lunch there (sushi) and explore a sand dune and to take some pix. Yes, although my pictures seem to have sand dunes in them, they were actually directly behind the Fred Meyer‚Äôs hehehe.
</p>



<p>
Our last night was spent in Lincoln City, with dinner at Wendy‚Äôs and some shopping at the Factory Outlets. Continuing on, the next day was spent shopping the ENTIRE day. First, at Lincoln City, then on the way back to Vancouver, we detoured to Sea Side and shopped there (more Factory Outlets) and had a seafood dinner at a local bar and grill, prior to arriving home at 2 AM. The city-line of Seattle is soo beautiful at night (as seen from the I-5/interstate) esp w the ‚Äúneedle‚Äù. I wish I had my camera ready, but when I did, it was already too late =(. And, that ends my trip. Phew. The week felt like eternity tho‚Äô; it was nice to be home again :).

Caught up w some friends, like Ron‚Äìsince he‚Äôs at the other UW. ‚ÄòMo, LB, Chris and I went biking around the Sea Wall in Stanley Park one day before our vacation. I have never done that before, and it was beautiful as well :). I felt like a tourist b/c I kept taking so many pics. I dunno why I‚Äôve never biked around the sea wall; there‚Äôs so much that‚Äôs to be seen along the path than if one was to drive. I think I‚Äôve tried to blade it before but b/c the blading patrol only allow one to skate one direction, I soon gave up as I was (and still am) an amateur. Also spent time w my cousin/family/relative, popped by a BBQ, bbltea-ed w Zeke,Ron, and my sis, lunched w Ron at Bread Garden, and DROVE to metro to eat dinner w Allen, Albe, Mur, and Vinay. The thai food at the Thai House isn‚Äôt all that good; the ones in Ottawa are tastier, tho‚Äô I have yet to try the famous <a href="http://www.siambistro.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Siam Bistro</a> up there (my supervisor at MOL recommends it!).
</p>



<p>
Note: the Abbotsford airport is less tight on security than the urban ones (YVR, YOW, YYZ). They didn‚Äôt make sure that my electronics worked tho‚Äô they did ask me to take them out. Ah yeh, FREE parking, and NO airport fee. not to mention, NO line up for anything, not even for the ticketing agents :). One can see the departure side from the arrivals. Strange eh? üôÇ Ah yes, 3 gates w no ‚Äúterminals‚Äù‚Ä¶you gotta get on the plane from the outside of the runway‚Ä¶and it smells like dung all around. Welcome to Abbotsford, BC :).
</p>



<p>
PS. One other thing, sitting in business class for no extra cost on Tango flights to Ottawa from TO and vice versa is very comfie!‚Äìjust keep in mind to book in first 5 or so rows in advance :).

		<p>				OCTranspo day passes are 2 adults for 1 for ‚Äúfamily‚Äù on Sundays and Holidays?! I hpe the srvice didn‚Äôt scare off Ann or Sue on Sunday as I noticed that a lot of ppl around me were nappin‚Äô during the sermon, tho Connie‚Äôs and Joe‚Äôs sharing were quite interesting :). For a quickie lunch, I took them to‚Ä¶.MK! üôÇ hahah. Alan served us and gave us the usual discount :). I think Ann was full b/c she ended finishing an entire yeung-chow chow fan! Off to Parliament we went and once again, we had to sign up for the French tour b/c the English one was once again filled up :|. Luckily, Ann sweet-talked our way into the English one once we were inside. I think I must‚Äôve imagined things but for some reason, I thot one of the portraits on the wall was stolen or damaged before but when I asked if all the portaits were original, the tour-guide said yes. The library was closed for renovations but we were able to go up to the Peace Tower (missed it somehow last time) to see a good view of Ottawa-Hull. Apparently, there‚Äôs a time capsule on the cornerstore of the building that was laid there in 1919.
Before the tour, there was time to kill, so we headed towards the <a href="http://www.mint.ca/en/index_home1.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Canadian Royal Mint</a> for a tour but apparently, the groups were full til past 16h00 so we settled for the <a href="http://www.warmuseum.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">War Museum</a> instead, which apparently is 1/2 price on Sundays AND if you have a group of 4 or less, one can have the family rate as well :). The museum isn‚Äôt too too interesting; not enuff objects and props‚Ä¶I think the US does a better job with their war/navy/etc. museums and memorials. Ann made a very interest‚Äôg observation dat a lot of the historic info seemed a l‚Äôil one-sided.
That was all the time we had for the day before we headed home to pack and to send them off on their way to Kingston again. We caught up on each others‚Äô lives this weekend and reminiscenced the good ol‚Äô high school years.
News flash: My cos just bought a PS2 (along w GT3) thanks to Jon =). WOOHOO~ Shame that I‚Äôm moving out this week to house-sit for my aunt/uncle in Orl√©ans.]]>		</p>

Onto lighter topics, I can‚Äôt believe that yesterday, I picked up some Christian books at a Coles liquidation for a really good price. I ended up purchasing three copies of <a href="http://www.christiananswers.net/catalog/bk-battle.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i>Every Man‚Äôs Battle</i></a> for $4.60 CDN (tax inclusive) each. The cashier prolly thought I‚Äôm crazy to not only have 3 copies, but also because it is a book geared for male readers. Although I‚Äôve read the book in approx 2 sittings, I‚Äôm reselling the three copies to my friends that wanted  to read it, as a group of them were goin through the book earlier in the term. I must say though, after reading the book, the content, tho‚Äô geared for men, it‚Äôs informative (72 hrs?!) and applicable to women as well. As sisters, in helping our brothers‚Äô in areas of sexual integrity/purity, it‚Äôs not only our modesty that other blogs have previously emphasised upon, but also it‚Äôs what we say and draw attn to (not only twds ourselves but twds others as well). I can‚Äôt really explain so I‚Äôm gonna tell you to read the book, if you haven‚Äôt already done so :P. Oh yeah, and I got my sis the sequel to <i>I Gave Dating a Chance</i>, which is called <i>He‚Äôs HOT, She‚Äôs HOT</i> by Jeramy/Jerusha Clark and Max Lucado‚Äôs <i>He Chose The Nails</i> for $2.99 and $3.99 CDN (tx exclusive) respectively :). For myself? A book by James Emery White (tho i‚Äôve never heard of him but by same publisher as the HOT and Battle bks)‚ÄìI tend to find Christian books in a table of secular titles by recognising the publishers on the spines: Word, Bethany House, Water Brook, etc.

		<p>				isn‚Äôt a public holiday under ESA 2000 so your employer is not obligated to give you a day off w pay), my long weekend felt like it started on Wednesday the 24th and a week early. 7 of us  from the MOL office in Ottawa met at 8:45 and begun our drive down to Toronto, stopping at a food court for lunch. I originally wanted to order the Works from NYF but they ran outta sour cream so I ended up ordering a Bacon Cheese Melt @ Wendy‚Äôs instead‚Ä¶and <a href="http://community.webshots.com/photo/34218257/44828637UWVDhL" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ken</a> generously treated :).


</p><p>
We arrived at the <a href="http://www.deltahotels.com/hotels/hotels.php?hotelid=10&cat=rooms&action=showrec&lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Delta Chelsea</a> in the afternoon and we split off our own ways. During check-in, the fellow at the front desk asked me if I was under 19, because apparently if one was, one wouldn‚Äôt be allowed to check-in! To kill time in btwn my meetin up w Rice and DD, I walkd to my TO workplace. I had no idea where it was, but thankfully it was pretty close. Joseph told me to take the subway and the streetcar to Bathurst/College from Gerrard/Bay, but because I didn‚Äôt know how to take the TTC or know how much I needed, I just risked it and walked, since I figured on the map it looked an ‚Äúok‚Äù distance to walk. Because of my much walking experience in Ottawa lately (since the MOL job), the 40 mins that it took me didn‚Äôt seem too long at all (6-8 blocks?)‚Ä¶tho I did screw up the address twice! =|
</p>



<p>
I finally met my ‚Äúboss‚Äù and Joseph ‚Äì Jon has really cute dimple(s) when he smiles; he reminds me of a l‚Äôil boy :T hehe. Somehow, I ended up persuading the entire office to try out wordracer on <a href="http://games.yahoo.com">games.yahoo.com</a>, and I think jon is addicted (he told me he stayed up til 4 am playing) =) YES! *evil grin* Even the ‚ÄúBig‚Äù boss, Mark, was playing, even after I left when DD and Rice came to pick me up. Did I neglect to mention that their office reminds me of a grad students room in the Math lab? =| Walking to their office was actually my first time wandering around TO on my own..it was a very interesting experience‚Ä¶
</p>



<p>
While DD rushed home to pick up Shoe, Rice and I picked up Rasp near Pharmacy/Finch. That was actually my first time meeting him face to face, but I‚Äôve seen his presence on Shoe‚Äôs website before so when I said, ‚ÄúNice to finally meet you!‚Äù, I didn‚Äôt realise he didn‚Äôt know what I was talking about til waaay later in the night when it clicked that I was indeed <i>b.p.</i>. We (along w Wendy) soon met at at MHQ in P.Mall for some k-ing. Occassion? To celebrate Shoe‚Äôs bday early. Yes, contrary to Shoe‚Äôs belief, we didn‚Äôt misremember the date like Wendy had, but b/c I was only in town for one day, we decided to celebrate early üôÇ (tonx of pix :P).
</p>



<p>
Yipes, I seem to have a headache from the lack of sleep we got that night. Think some only averaged 3 hours while I slept a lil over 4-5 hrs. After 2 hrs of krazy K-ing, we decided to drive to 1st Markam Place to eat at Congee Wong (yum). We stuffed ourselves for only $5 a head =). Somehow or another, we ended up at DD‚Äôs place and Rice and DD soon came over and we found an empty ballroom, so we tried to teach Rice how to dance‚Ä¶I miss it! DD helped me refresh some of the steps that I‚Äôve forgotten and by the time we were finished, it was almost 2 am. Crazy, especially since they had to wake up early to go to work the following day. Hehe, it was a fun evening tho‚Äô (@ least we d/n get drunk and hung over, unlike some of our co-workers :{ ). I almost freaked the next day, when I awoke to find that my hotel bill came to $173.60, but upon checking out, they explained that it was credited back to my account and that amount was just a mere deposit of some sort‚Ä¶amazingly, the lady who checked me in remembered my name and room number! What memory/service considering they prolly see many faces in a day! =)
</p>



<p>
Today, Thurs, 25th, all 7 of us met up again to head off to the C3 conference on Wellesley, from 9:30-14:30. The conference itself was actually somewhat boring until the very end, where we could actually apply some relevant info to our career paths. Once that was done, we begun our long journey home and stopped in Kingston for some Swiss Chalet before arriving in Ottawa close to 20:30. Thankfully, we had meal allowances as a part of the paid trip =). Finally, we have a DAY-OFF tomolo w pay!! =). G‚Äônite.</p>

August 28, 2000
<br>
Dear God:
<br>
Thank you for the l‚Äôil encouragements of life (if I may call them that). I haven‚Äôt seen Ron(ald Chan) in years at church, and I‚Äôve just about given up on inviting everything to church =|. And yet, with Ron showing up this past week‚Ä¶i‚Äôm encouraged that with You, all things are possible :). That in this world, there are people who have willing hearts and not everyone will make up excuses to avoid church. I often see [attending] church and anything related (fellowship, events, etc.) as a stepping stone closer to You, which may or may not be the case in reality (bad experiences may draw them away). I continue to pray for Ron‚Äìthat his willingness to go to church would make him want to go more and be receptive of the gospel. That in UW, You will bring into his life, people that belong to You already‚Äìppl that may continue to water the seed that may have already been planted, or to plant that seed. You know that I would love to see him enter the Kingdom, yet if I dont‚Äô see it happen in my time, I ask that he‚Äôll open up to You before his time is up. Thank you once again for these small miracles.
<br>
In Jesus‚Äô Name,<br>
Amen.
</i>
</p>



<p>
Well, as you already know, my prayers (this was only one of them) has been answered. I just wanted to share that w you =P Gnite.</p>

		<p>				finally üòõ takes the last step and commits his life to Christ =). God sure taught me a lesson there since I almost gave up on prayer and hope completely‚Ä¶so it‚Äôs been 9 years‚Ä¶feels like eternity, but it‚Äôs been worth it to see his journey from then to now :). So, everyone who knows Ronald Chan, you‚Äôre cordially invited to his baptism on December 15th at ECC in Seattle, WA. Mark your calendars! =)
The weekend was filled with many events. I wanted to further elaborate on them but because I know if I don‚Äôt sleep soon, I won‚Äôt function properly tomolo, so here‚Äôs the highlights:
<i>Friday evenin‚Äô</i>: Praise and Prayer at Chau Wing and Roger‚Äôs place. Tho‚Äô I likely missed the prayer portion of the night because we left early, I think it was a good size for sharing/etc. Cyn, How, SilQ, Marcy, Roge, Chau Wing, and myself begun the evening w‚Äô sheree, adrian, alice, and nathan joinin‚Äô later. However, the P&P weren‚Äôt as good as I wanted it b/c I found it very chaotic and didn‚Äôt really flow for parts of the night‚Ä¶but I‚Äôm certain that this group had good fellowship and hang time b/c they ended up stayin‚Äô til 4:30 AM b/c they watched FF and Emperor‚Äôs New Groove.
<i>Saturday</i>: Exploring! I love exploring :). The next morning, I woke up early to get ready to go caving/spelunking at Lusk Caves. On the particular morning, Marc decided to bail out on me b/c of a sore back, but I guess it all worked out anyhow b/c Danny drove 6 of us there in his van (Me, Ange, Adrian, Alice, Dawn, and J) . The driving and walking distance is further than I expected but it was all worth it :). The hike up seemed to take forever, but because we followed the road instead of the trails down, it saved a lot of time. But, I think next time, we should plan to spend at least 6 hours, if not more, for the entire trip.
I‚Äôd like to say something about their maps tho‚Äô‚Äìthey‚Äôre not very good; especially the ones that lead to the entrance of the caves. We first stumbled upon the exit of the caves and if I had not seen the hidden sign explaining that the entrance was 100 metres away, we‚Äôd wouldn‚Äôt have known to venture further. Along the way, there was another sign and ‚Äúmini entrance‚Äù to the caves but upon investigation, the ‚Äúyou are here‚Äù marked the latter part of the caves. However, as Dawn led the way, it seemed that we lost the trail and did not find the entrance afterall but instead, entered midway (which we thought was the entrance b/c nobody really read the sign thoroughly enuff). The stangest thing is that the entrance that we entered in, there really wasn‚Äôt any exit on the left of us.  I think that if we had read this article from the Ottawa Citizen, we‚Äôd been better prepared on what to expect and what to look out for‚Ä¶speaking of looking out, we saw a deer in the bushes w/in walking distance on the way up as well‚Ä¶
Our journey w.in took approximately 25-35 mins with time for pics (ange‚Äôs camera, which thankfully didn‚Äôt get wet :P). Ange‚Äôs advice to bring flashlights and wear swimwear neath clothing really helped b/c although the water at mouth of the open caves were only ankle deep and natural light let through, eventually the caves were pitch black and water went to the knees, past the waist, and at the very last stretch (exit), the water was chin high. I almost freaked out when the ‚Äúceiling‚Äù/overhang ended up to be very low and the water very high b‚Äôc adrian or j went ahead and warned everyone that they might haveta submerge under water to pass the crevice (as I cannot swim). With the help of ‚Äúfinger holds‚Äù (rocks sticking out), moving through the caves was a lot easier. As I waded slowly through the water, I was fortunate that I was short b/c my head fit under the overhang perfectly w/o me having to duck or anything :). However, at one pt, I was so certain that I wasn‚Äôt gonna make it b/c the water was just sooo cold against my upper body. Felt like I was gonna get hypothermia, but we all survived ‚Äòtho I hit my head really hard against the marble stone (yeah, it‚Äôs marble!) upon exiting üòê . Thankfully, it was just at the exit of the cave (tho I‚Äôm certain that there were also deep areas of water in the part that we failed to xplore). Another thing to thank God for: the sunshine that day really helped us to dry off and keep warm as we treked back towards the car all in one piece, arriving at OCAC in time for dinner and JAM. I wanna go again! =).
<i>Sunday</i>: As the guys and the other girls played volleyball (J and ange swam too) on the beach (mooney‚Äôs bay), Elaina and I opted to sit out and just talk. I didn‚Äôt realise how much in common we have until yesterday. I actually didn‚Äôt really get to know her til this year, even tho I‚Äôve seen her last year at OCAC and occasionally ICQed her over the year about VCBC ppl. I really enjoyed our time laughing and sharing our opinions about certain things :). It‚Äôs no wonder that ppl think that she looks like my sister. =P As a bystander, I ended up taking some <a href="http://community.webshots.com/album/37405550MsDxQw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pix</a> of the game they had and i really like some of the shots‚Ä¶I haven‚Äôt had a chance to edit the videos but I‚Äôll do that and upload them eventually :).]]>		</p>

we ended up completing 15 questionnaires today (quota:9) and something interesting ended up on our list. Our employer generates target lists for our field visits with very specific criteria. Above all, the generator of the lists attempted to weed out any shady places. However, they missed one. Nevertheless, I ended up in a store that advertised itself as ‚Äúa store for women and those who love them‚Äù. I‚Äôll keep this nicely layed-out (no pun intended) store anonymous (so you HSBTLs won‚Äôt find entertainment/amusement in this) tho J said that it started in Halifax and after researching their website, he‚Äôs right (it isn‚Äôt dumpy unlike other adult stores and from the window, one would just see it as a women‚Äôs health/sexuality store). Besides, the gal there was really nice and answered my questions :). Strangely enuff, the store didn‚Äôt really (note the ‚Äòreally‚Äô) bother me until I  saw this tiny l‚Äôil sign in the bottom corner of the door window upon my exit which read, ‚ÄúYou must be 18+ to enter the store‚Äù. Anyhow, I think I‚Äôll end my sharing here =|.</p>

As I was walking down Williams Street in my blue T before breaking for lunch today, I tried to avoid the young guy smoking a cigarette on the ledge of a store (knowing full well that he was probably  a street bum). Well, as I approached, I felt that walking on the street would be too mean (afterall, he is a human being‚ÄìI notice that I‚Äôm more friendly when I‚Äôm on the job and interacting w ppl), so I just stayed where I was (near the edge of the sidewalk). About a foot away, he asked, ‚ÄúGot any spare change?‚Äù. My instinctive response was to ignore him and move on, but I couldn‚Äôt really pretend that he was asking someone else b/c there really wasn‚Äôt any one else around that he could‚Äôve directed the question towards, so I looked at him and answered, ‚ÄúNo, sorry.‚Äù and begun to continue my path forward. His next quip?  ‚ÄúGot a blue top?‚Äù
