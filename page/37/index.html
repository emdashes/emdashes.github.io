		<p>				seatguru.com). The window seat also provided more storage space (under seat in front) as it was wider than the aisle seat and the middle seat had some sort of console blocking the leg/storage room.
The view from the window was gorgeous – especially on the way to BC. With the sun setting, we passed over the Rocky Mountains. I could see the tips of the mountains covered with snow, and the glacial lakes in the craters. I marvelled at the creation and as we descended, my thoughts were on how small the people, cars, and the things below were, but we have measure words like tall, to describe these people. Yet, even though we are this small, God still cares.
I recently read <a href="http://www.granvilleonline.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">granville magazine</a> and I now realise that flying isn’t that great for the environment. I’ve also noticed that being green is very “in” right now – while reading the magazine, I recollected the “green” condo in TO, that was selling for close to a million dollars. The magazine mentioned another buzzword, “sustainability” which reminded me of Vonnekins, who did ES at UW and wondered how she feels about the current eco-trends.

The wedding was nice and small, simple and thoughtful, and a joy to attend. The choice to go with a Western wedding (as opposed to Chinese) was refreshing as well. Even though it rained (which prompted for the outdoor wedding to be moved into the solarium), the grey overcast skies probably provided even better lighting for photographs – less harsh shadows and no risk of sun flares. I think Mur and I were especially happy to see the first of among our closer friends during our high school years to be married. Oh, how we’ve grown. I only hope that we continue our friendships even after we are all married.
PS. Hi Boy, I just received your postcard yesterday – I guess it took them 2 weeks to send it :P]]>

		<p>				There’s a petite Asian co-op on our team at my workplace. Some people have remarked how similar we look, and I’ve even gotten called by her name – I’m never sure if it’s because “Asians look remarkably similar” or it’s because we share commonalities: longish hair (both in a ponytail at times), glasses, small frame/bone structure. Incidentally, we share the same cube wall. But, the difference in our names help distinguish that we are different people.</p>




<p>****<br>
On that note, I would think that if two books, published by the same people, go by the same name, I would assume the content inside the two books are the same. Boy, was I was ever surprised to learn otherwise.</p>




<p>When I found that the guest speaker was going to preach on <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=malachi%204;&version=51;" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Malachi 4</a> from the New Living Translation (NLT), I was prepared. I brought my NLT bible to church anticipating that I could follow along. Was I ever wrong! As he began to read from the passage, I started to notice that words were different: in my NLT bible, it started off with “Lord Almighty”, but what was he saying – “The Lord of Heaven’s Armies”? Did one of us have a fraudulent Bible?</p>




<p>I later asked and found out that the NLT actually has 2 versions – one from 1996 and one from 2004. I had the earlier edition. How was I supposed to know that they came out with another edition under the same name? Other versions of the Bible tends to distinguishes updated versions by adding “New” in front or other names such as: tNIV (today’s NIV), NKJV (new King James), but I guess their logic must have been if they added New to New Living Translation, it would be New New Living Translation, which would be redundant.</p>




<p>****</p>




<p>It’s no wonder that people (like me) don’t know everyone’s names on our team; the size of my team is bigger than the last company I worked at! Thank goodness we have subteams.</p>

		<p>				When I dropped Grace off at the <a href="http://www.waterlooairport.ca" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Region of Waterloo International Airport</a>, I made a few discoveries:</p>




<ul><li>Parking is $1 an hour for pay and display (or $1 per 15 mins at metered parking), $30/7 days</li>




<li>This airport has a small-town airport feel, much like Abbotsford’s</li>




<li>Grace took WestJet’s inaugural flight at YKF – which came with free drinks and cupcakes, along with a German band and mascot</li>




<li>I commented to the lady at the check-in counter that it seemed very busy; apparently 1/2 the people were there for WestJet celebrations</li>




<li>You need to weigh the luggage yourself, and lug it up onto the x-ray machine prior to throwing it on the conveyor belt</li>




<li>There are only 2 gates – and passengers ascend the plane on stairs, like celebrities</li>




<li>Customs/security/airport staff are friendly</li>

<p>Distance wise – it takes me 10 minutes (without traffic) from the airport to my house. This is a very, very attractive alternative over YYZ.</p>

		<p>				The book of Judges paints me a portrait of a God who is relenting, but just. The Old Testament God seems to be a stark contrast of the God in the New Testament, but they are the same. The stories of wars and His wrath on the disobedient really wakes me up to realize a new meaning of “fearing God”. All along, I have tried to believe that to fear God, is not to be afraid but more to hold an attitude of reverence, of respect. For me, to respect a loving, forgiving and gracious God seems pretty straight forward; but knowing a God who is capable of justice, of discipline is one that calls for reverence, for fear.</p>




<p>I am reminded of the other day, when I was driving through the streets of downtown Kitchener, I happened to pass a banner that had the words printed, “You are not alone” which happened to be at the exact moment a Christian artist was singing, “you are not alone” on the radio. Although the words on the banner was reaching to abused women, the lyrics referred to a comfort and hope beyond this world. Odd coincidence? Maybe. Likely not.</p>

		<p>				Owly is as cute as always. The Mickey Mouse and Robin Hood one was featured from a book of a collection of old Mickey comics that I actually own (I think my parents bought it from Costco back when I really liked Mickey).
In any case, Now & Then Books in Kitchener now has 60% off all graphic novels, and 80% off toys (and everything else?). A few weeks back, j.w and I had just happened upon it and the owner had announced that all graphic novels were 50% off and everything else was 75% (or was it 70%?). The credit/debit machine “is down” so trips to the bank equates to an additional 5% off. I picked up a few books: last copies of a sun-bleached Owly: Just A Little Blue and Afterworks II (an anthology by Pixar artists it seems). I had curiously asked if they were closing, but he had told me that they were just trying to get rid of 30+ years of inventory. This time around, a sign on the window said For Lease, while the back of it said Sold and he mentioned this [“sale”] should be on ’til end of May or early June.]]>		</p>

		<p>				It’s spring and I’m beginning to wonder what hay fever feels like and how it differs from a cold. Does hay fever just sneak up on you, where one minute you’re fine and the next minute you feel like sneezing (but can’t – hate that!) and you’re all sniffly? Or, are those symptoms of a cold?</p>




<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aimeili/274776096/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/121/274776096_997d43df49_t.jpg" width="100" height="75" alt="Salad" align="right" border="0"></a>Spring also marks the beginning of a line of weddings and related events. I’ve never been to a bridal shower before, but one that requests a favourite recipe already has me thinking this is a very girlie sounding event. One that I’m at a loss for because I rarely (if ever) bake and I do not cook with any set recipes. j.w and I have a theory that my best cooking comes when I experiment for the first time and then I am never ever able to repeat it again.</p>

		<p>				I will have the honour to give a toast to a bride this year. As the bridesmaid and I are discussing about our memories that we have of the bride, I start to think that at times, it sounds like we are giving a farewell. And, I guess, in a way it is; just not one that is given at funerals.</p>




<p align="center"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aimeili/243536941/" title="A bridesmaid's bouquet by b.p., on Flickr"><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/96/243536941_b239208802_m.jpg" width="240" height="199" alt="A bridesmaid's boquet"></a></p>




<p>I guess I’m at the point in life, where it seems like <i>everyone</i> around me is getting engaged and married. This year, I’ll be attending at least 3 weddings; next, at least 4 more are in scope. That doesn’t sound like much, but when you have to fly or drive out of town to get to them or you are helping out in some, then it feels like a lot. Regardless, congratulations to <a href="http://smileyshe.blogspot.com/2007/04/cant-wipe-that-smile-off-my-face.html">my little sister</a>, who isn’t so little anymore I suppose (somehow, I knew she’d be first in our family). 🙂</p>

		<p>				after spending multiple hours napping two afternoons in a row and sleeping at night, it brings about some interesting dreams:</p>



<p>Mel C (or anotehr girl similiar to her) and i went down somewhere (i think to meet someone or had a scheduled appointment) but as we ventured down the tunnels (which were lined with rocks) and as we reached the bottom, we noticed that the rocks were wet, and dirt from above had somehow collected and resulted in a mudslide. so we were going to go back (through another way). as we tried to move to another corridor, we noticed that water had begun to pool ahead; it seemed pretty deep. just as we were going to turn back, i noticed that there were two people (guys) with flashlights in the trees that came down to look for something, so we asked them if they knew a way back. they did. so they took us with them. turns out they were looking for some prisoner they had, so they took us in tow instead and ended up taking us across the border to china.</p>



<p>they somehow expected us to report back to their base every night, but other than that, they pretty much let us reign free. however, one time, i went into this electronics store and i was talking to them in english (and not cantonese as we were in HK). so two guys working at the store figured out that we were part of the prisoners group (i think from then on, i tried to speak cantonese in public) and ask they scanned us with some sort of scanner, parts of our body/clothing glowed yellow (kind of like UV light)- one was a note from Barb and Arnold to me. They asked me what it was and how it got there – and I told them I didn’t know (which I didn’t). I think Barb and Arnold had hoped that we’d find those notes first.  I did recall going into a church for haven/escape, but the first one we passed, it was in the middle of a wedding ceremony. The 2nd was much bigger, so we were able to walk through the back of the sanctuary (also in the middle of a wedding ceremony) into meeting rooms. We met some friendly people there and we tried to meet in a meeting room where there was no window in the front.</p>



<p>Later on, I met up with Jon and Mel L and Joseph.</p>



<p>***</p>



<p>There were fish. Lots of fish. One had sympathy for the fish. So, we devised a plan, where they would separate the seal / walrus tank so that it would be half and half and that it would rotate so that people who fished would only be allowed to fish from half a tank, so that it allowed the other half of the tank to replenish itself.</p>



<p>***</p>



<p>Was trying to get home in heels. Went through a mall – sears where it had one floor of kids clothing; some at 70% off. Across the street was The Bay. On the way out from the sears’ side doors to the sidewalk (next to the street and the bus), walked past the bay and somehow ended up stopping by a real estate model home. There was already a group in there, and they were discussing the housing options. I ended up taking notes. They talked about the possibility of co-habiting, no, co-housing (24 rooms with shared facilities). I asked one question – about how flexible the exterior changes were w the rest of the complex. Then I left because I was startiing to get bored and because apparently I had to meet someone. As I left, I went to walk right, but it was just pure gravel. I went past the home that was attached to the model house and noticed some International students inside. Someone peered out and said that I couldn’t cut across the field like that. They also ended up locking the door once I left – which made me to think that this was an exclusive sale. </p>
