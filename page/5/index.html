Though some days, it feels like more. The latest word trend after terrible twos, is not terrifying threes, but threenager. This past year was definitely a year of growth for Bean, both physically and developmentally, expressing herself more verbally, and understanding negotiation tactics, and lately, how to use a firm no. Instead of terrible or tantrum twos (thankfully), I would say teary twos, with more tears  as of late and constant[ly the same] questions, accompanied with some whining, as she flip flips from learned independence to craved dependence. She enjoys watching mommy cook and helps out wherever she can: whether it’s loading the laundry machine, putting dishes away, prepping food for cooking – I often have to remind myself that although it’s often faster to do it myself, it’s these moments that are teaching and practice opportunities, and that I will likely regret it later when she does grow up and decide helping mommy do house chores isn’t exactly fun.  She’s growing up though: almost toilet-trained (didn’t take the 3 day potty training route), figured out how to blow her nose, uses the correct personal pronouns more often, and eagerly takes on older sister roles, like feeding the baby, or watching and/or playing with him (ie. bossing him around) while mommy is momentarily occupied or keeping a watchful eye from a distance, which when he co-operates is quite wonderful as I can multi-task. She also enjoys finishing off her brother’s unfinished leftovers, which I remember I enjoyed too when my younger brother was eating baby food. Lately though, she has also reverted to not wanting to sleep on her own at night and wakes up multiple times in one night.
Things that have not changed much through the first three years:


<ol><li>She is  happy to be the cautious observer-follower instead of the leader, though she can be determined/persistent (aka stubborn, like both her parents) – which sometimes translates to being fiesty, and/or bossy. For her, being a cautious observer seems to lends well to having an eye for detail and a good memory.</li>


    

<li>She hates the feeling of tears and runny nose on her face when it is caused by crying and she refuses to wipe it herself. The more you make her, the more water works result – a vicious cycle, really. Meltdowns often happen around some seemingly inconsequential thing, but it’s really a build-up of unsaid/unresolved feelings inside (maybe it’s feeling like she’s not being heard or lack of closeness / security that you’re there)</li>


    

<li>Early enthused independence of feeding herself does not translate to continued self-independence</li>


</ol><hr><h2>2:</h2>


In other developmental news, our almost 8-month old can now roll over from front to back, and back to front, though I think he really just rolls in one direction each way. He also can sit up unassisted for extended periods, and we have been practicing moving by trying to place items he wants a little beyond his reach. While he mouths everything, I can already sense that he is a much pickier eater than Bean was, despite his love for bananas and apples and sometimes sweet potatoes; he appears to really dislike yogurt, and maybe because it’s really cold and when upon skin contact, it turned red (like it did with peanut oil, tomatoes, and oranges for Bean). While we haven’t given rice cereal after that one time when he threw it all up, he doesn’t seem to have any problems with regular rice or barley. We need to give him more opportunities to practice grabbing food and eating it, which he has been with chunks of bananas, raw chunks of apples and celery sticks (a perfect gnawing/teething food I find), cooked zucchini and pasta tubes (rigatoni), a messy experiment as it often ends up on the floor, though I might try cooked broccoli florets or carrots next; the harder foods like apples and celery I need to watch closely as sometimes he swallows before chewing it well.  He’s still a relatively chill baby, which I am especially thankful for as I don’t think I would be able to handle two of the same temperaments; he is content to spend time in the playpen (or modern term: play yard) with his toys or chewing on a toy in his swing, preferring these two items more often than in the bouncer, and I can leave him for a short to an extended period, depending on his mood, before he complains, whereas his sister would still prefer that I am next to her all the time, if she had her way.  I’m glad our playpen is getting some use, as Bean didn’t like it back then (same story with Sophie la giraffe), although she now enjoys going inside at times to sit and play with him! He’s also been able to effectively eliminate on the mini toilet seat a few times which saved me from having to clean up a messy (cloth) diaper, but we have also encountered baby in pain while trying to strain, poor boy.


<blockquote>For this boy I prayed, and the Lord has given me my petition which I asked of Him. So I have also dedicated him to the Lord; as long as he lives he is dedicated to the Lord.” – 1 Samuel 1:27-28a (NASB)
Train up a child in the way he should go: and when he is old, he will not depart from it.” – Proverbs 22:6 (KJV)</blockquote>


As parents, we feel that it is important to lead and spiritually nurture our children so that they will develop a desire to love God and be followers of Christ, so  while we had a small baby dedication ceremony at Bean’s one-month celebration, we decided to wait until j.w’s family could join us and held off until this year’s baptism service at our church (which effectively became a baptism + baby dedication service); it was especially meaningful to see our friends and family who don’t normally go our church present as I felt like they’re the ones that will support us in raising our children[ref]it takes a village, as the saying goes [/ref].


<hr><h2>3:</h2>


A friend recently commented that I look thinner yet again, and to my surprise when I stepped on the scale, she was right. Turns out it took me almost 8 months, 3 months longer to reach the low end of my last postpartum weight loss, and more – no wonder my pants all feel loose; I was beginning to attribute it to pregnancy stretching them out.  I’d better consult the “<a href="http://her.happyhippos.ca/2013/12/how-to-gain-more-weight/">How to gain more weight</a>” post again. /86]]>

After finally realizing what it was, it looks like it has burrowed into her head[/caption]
Around 6:30 AM one morning, Bean woke up and didn’t go back to sleep but was content to lie in bed with me. At some point, she told me that something was bothering her at the back of her head (her one-worded summary: “ow”), near the nape of her neck. In my sleepy haze, I parted her hair and took a peek. A skin-coloured lump, almost the size of my pinky fingernail, puzzled and troubled me so I tried to get a closer look with a tissue because I didn’t want to touch it because it looked like it had hair follicles, which also sort of resembled short insect-like legs. So, trying to hide my “heebies jeebies”[ref]the “heebie jeebies” accurately sums how I feel, as used by one forum poster with his experience[/ref], I asked her if she wanted Daddy or Grandma to come in to help me, and she said Grandma, so I went to get a second opinion. Grandma later told me she took a video and some photos and sent it to a doctor friend of hers, who admitted he didn’t know what it was, perhaps an insect bite or an infection with a sac. We made an appointment with our family doctor, and I started googling and looking for images of skin tags that matched what I had seen – nothing that looked that size, even though the description seemed to match.
At the doctor’s office, the nurse and the doctor took a look and confirmed that it was a skin tag. Her explanation was in line with what I had read online: that they’re benign, often made of the same cells and components of your skin, so you will see things like hair follicles, and that this one had a stalk. I couldn’t figure out how I missed it (since I comb her hair daily), but I asked how long it could have been there for, and she explained that it could have been there for awhile but was hard to spot because it wasn’t bothering Bean. She told us that it look like it was going to auto-amputate because the stalk end/base was starting to turn bluish, so we had a few options:


</p><ol><li>Leave it be, and see how long it would take. Usually for smaller skin tags, it takes 2-3 days, but this one could be slower because of its size.</li>


    

<li>Use liquid nitrogen to burn it off. I asked how the pain would be compared to a needle, and she said it would probably be the same intensity but longer.</li>


    

<li>Something similar to #2 but with local freezing. We opted to go with this.</li>


</ol>

For whatever reason, she decided to take a second look, and this time, IT MOVED. I appreciate that she didn’t freak out, because I would have – and certainly did inside. Instead, she calmly said that she was going outside to get a second doctor’s opinion and help. The second doctor was a lot more certain that it was a tick and they partnered to quickly remove it with a pair of tweezers; it was still very much alive in the urine sample jar they put it in, so we assume that every bit came out (thus reducing Lyme disease, if at risk) – the second doctor must have really wanted to make sure for he must have pulled extra skin and hair off, because Bean started crying even more and I was handed a piece of gauze to apply pressure to stop the bleeding[ref]a week later, the spot looks raised with a dark scab, and it must feel tender because it still bothers her[/ref]. Google helped identify the tick as a dog tick, which isn’t as great of a threat as the black-legged ticks, but they jarred it anyway to be sent for analysis. She called a contact to see if we needed to start antibiotic treatment, as their guidelines only offered advice to those over 8 years of age. Later, she also followed up to tell us that Public Health would call if they found something of concern and texted us some close-up photos. We don’t have a dog, but we did go to the urban natural area the day before, and that’s likely where we picked it up.
I also appreciated that she apologized and retracted her first diagnosis; she had seen ticks before, but none this size[ref]I don’t blame her – Google tells me that it was an adult female in its partially fed state so it would be bigger[/ref]. She’s a family doctor, so I can’t expect her to know everything, even though we hope they know what ails us. She recognized that even though I had made comments about characteristics reminding me of an insect, it was likely that everyone’s quick glance assumptions as a skin tag threw everyone off.

I like being outdoors. I enjoy aspects of camping, canoeing, and especially hiking; I remember my dad would take us on walks and bike rides around trails when we were much younger. In all my years doing activities outdoors, I would have never imagined having to deal with this. Thankfully, I think this experience was more traumatic for me than it was for Bean, since she didn’t see what was bothering her, despite some tears and pain.
Thank God that Bean noticed it, and He answered our prayers, giving wisdom to our doctor who for reason decided to do a second  look – because who knows if we would’ve found it otherwise. Plus, I am really glad that I didn’t have to remove it myself.]]>

<li>Growing his first tooth. He pulled my finger into his mouth a few days ago, and when he gnawed down my finger, I noticed something sharp. He puts everything in his mouth though (his hand was in his mouth at birth after all), but lately, he loves Sophie; I know this because he lets me know with displeasure when she’s dropped. Thank goodness they’re getting some use, because Bean didn’t put anything in her mouth, so our quality teething toys were neglected (they’re pricey!)</li>





As I celebrate[ref]in-laws came this year to help, thus relieving me to go off to get birthday freebies, enjoying a long nap (longer than a current sleep cycle at night), a dinner+dessert date with j.w, and daddy took the kids for their bed time while I enjoyed an evening out with small group friends, all #kidfree over a course of a few days![/ref] being another year older, a conversation I had with a friend from my high school days reminded me that this year is significant because it would mean I have spent almost half my life in Ontario. <em>Crazy</em>. That means after this point, I can’t and shouldn’t be calling “Vancouver” home unless I move back.
Next month, Bean will turn three. We’re <em>still</em> working on toilet training – that’s the biggest challenge; I feel guilty since I missed the window of opportunity (the time when she peed without any bottoms on and realized it was on her leg, and she told me that she needed to go the second time during the same hour). As she gets older, I realize that one of her current combo strength is an eye for detail and a good memory – unless this happens with every kid. She observes and remembers the tiniest details: I ask her if she’s seen pieces of her toys  a day or so later, she tells me; she tells me she threw the cloth diaper behind my bed a few days ago; describes what she ate and drank during her time while mommy+baby has a program; and tells me about the brown dog at a new friend’s house, with the blue leash (turns out, my husband tells me that it’s a stuffed dog – no wonder she wasn’t afraid of it!). She also seems to notice or ask me about things that I wouldn’t expect a toddler to pay attention to, like what’s on a specific shelf after I briefly open and close the fridge door.

</p><li><strong>Similarities</strong>: they both had a phase where they disliked car rides, and let me tell you that driving with a crying baby is very stressful and makes for a very unpleasant ride for everyone (though the toddler’s coping mechanism seems to be singing to herself); they both battled a severe bought of eczema; when there are visual distractions around, they fall asleep faster and stay asleep longer with a breathable covering over their heads; a bald spot appeared on their back of their heads from shaking their heads back and forth vigorously on their sleeping surfaces; they now share the same size diapers</li>


    

<li><strong>Differences</strong>: he tolerates the swing; can fall asleep on his own fairly quickly when he is swaddled and has a pacifier; does not fall asleep much while breastfeeding and will finish a feed fairly quickly; he happily puts everything in his mouth (after all, he was pretty much born sucking on his hand, which means we might have to baby-proof the house which we didn’t have to worry about before); he is a heavy baby, chubs, with a big head (he’s now around 16-17 lbs) – thankfully that was of the boy and not the girl, and thankfully for the second, since my muscles are slightly used to the heavier first child</li>





#secondchildsyndrome means that I almost missed some milestones, or failed to record them – including a lack of photos, especially photos with the entire family and me and him together:


<ul><li>lots of cooing still; he has discovered how to blow bubbles and figured out how to make a high-pitched squeal – which is amusing because his friend, just a couple of months older than him went through the same thing a few weeks ago (and he reminded her to blow bubbles again haha)</li>


    

<li>he knows how to reach up to play with toys – I put him in the play pen and I had dangled a toy off the mobile, and he reached up to play with it</li>


    

<li>he also managed to rotate 90 degrees in the playpen – probably by pushing his feet against the sides</li>


    

<li>tummy time is a bit easier for him now – he can hold his head up longer before complaining (instead of a face plant into the floor)</li>


    

<li>he can almost sit up like a tripod (bent forward toward his toes)</li>


    

<li>he sits up better in the bumbo these days, but he still tends to lean sideways shortly after he’s in</li>


    

<li>his sleep-cycle is more regular: 2 in the morning (30-40 min nap within 2 hours of the morning wake-up, then another 30-40 min nap 2 hours after that, usually around when we eat lunch thankfully), and 1 long nap in the afternoon (when toddler is sleeping – first by himself, and then with me feeding/holding him), a short nap just before or during dinner, and bed time around when the toddler sleeps</li>


</ul>


In toddler news, her current favourite colour is green and ESL English/Chinglish is picking up speed, despite a Chinese accent that accompanies it (though her English seems more whiny than her Chinese – not sure if it’s just the tone of voice). Her appetite is growing, and pan-fried, grandma-made potsticker dumplings are one of our favourite lunch meals right now, because she feeds herself – with chopsticks – for most of the meal, and she can eat up to 7 dumplings at a time! The other day, at her friend’s 5yo birthday party, she was one of the few younger ones who enjoyed following the dance teacher’s instructions – maybe it’s time to sign her up in some form of group lessons or activity soon.]]>

At the start of the year, I had shared with j.w two of my <del>resolutions</del>[ref]I don’t believe in resolutions as I don’t (like to) make promises I can’t keep[/ref] goals for the year, which he has helped me to meet: make our bed daily (a little step towards to tidiness) and get a little library up and running in our front yard (community).
A community build event took place and j.w put together most of the little library house. To our surprise, we now share another thing in common with our neighbours two houses down: not only do our sons share the same first name, but they also have the same gable-style library that they picked up the same morning!
Sometime this summer, I aim to paint/stain it, seal it, and then put it up with some family-friendly reading, primarily books in the Christian and children genre. While there are plenty of other little libraries with children’s literature, I wonder what the uptake will be on Christian books. I have other little ideas for it, including maybe a Facebook group to post what’s available, a NFC check-in tag, as well a QR tag to track the location and review of the books that go through our little library – those are lofty ideas, so we shall see.

After a morning of building most of the little library, we rushed to the waste management site. I had signed us up to go because of Bean’s interest in garbage trucks and buses – a school bus was to take us on a tour of the site, with pauses at the current landfill, and a stop at the recycling centre. If their goal of open houses is to send an environmental message home, I think it achieved it with our family; it probably ended up being the most educational for us, the parents. Here’s what I learned:

<li>The waste management site “hires” two <a href="http://www.therecord.com/news-story/4260095-this-job-is-for-the-birds/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hawks to send seagulls away</a> a few times a week</li>


    

<li>Mount Trashmore, our local popular tobogganing hill, was discontinued as a landfill in the ’70s</li>


    

<li>Landfills that are at max capacity are capped with ceramic before being topped with soil and grass</li>


    

<li>Items you throw in the garbage that you know are biodegradable or claims to biodegrade in X days won’t actually ever if it ends up in the landfill because the environment isn’t right for it; it actually gets packed down (sort of WALL-E-like), so it lacks oxygen and organisms that break it down</li>


    

<li>A tarp-like sheet goes over every layer of garbage to keep it from blowing away and fumes and moisture are sent through pipes, where the methane gas is collected and converted into energy; I didn’t see any burning pipes anywhere, nor did it smell nearly as bad as the one we used to drive back next to Highway 1 back home before it got converted to a driving range</li>


</ul>


You could say that we unknowingly took part in some Earth Day weekend activities, with a specific focus on recycling / reusing (books in the community instead of the garbage, and learning about recycling operations in our city). It felt like a long day, but it wasn’t even mid-afternoon yet by the time we finished! While I do enjoy doing our regular stops, after this past Saturday’s activities together as a family, I find it’s worth waking up early if it means doing something different.
Some neat upcoming events in May around #kwawesome that you could do with your family, a date, or friends are:


<ul><li>Saturday, May 7, 9-10:30a <a href="http://janeswalk.org/canada/kitchener/lets-have-coffee-or-10/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Coffee walk around Downtown Kitchener (DTK)</a></li>


    

<li>Sunday, May 8, 2p <a href="http://janeswalk.org/canada/kitchener/spur-line-trail-smile-tiger-berlin-bicycle-cafe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Coffee tour bike-ride on Spur Line Trail</a></li>


    

<li>Friday, May 27, 6-7p Listening choir DTK (probably not suitable for families with little ones, as they will likely get impatient or lose attention since there’s no speaking and you stand and appreciate the urban noise) – other dates are also available</li>


</ul>

So the common theme seems to be a heat-expelling formula that targets the digestive system, which seems to be in-line with western natural wellness thinking – that eczema is a symptom of what’s going on in your gut / digestive system / with your digestion, often a sign of food sensitivities or allergies. This also seems to match what another Chinese herbal remedies site suggests about common formulas[ref]. Wonder if this kind of “heat” is the same as “hot air”-associated foods like chocolate (she did say not to have any), chips, crustaceans, deep-fried oily food. And would eating “cooling” foods like watermelon, cucumber, bittermelon help with baby’s skin then?

I think I would still prefer naturopathic doctors (ND) over Chinese doctors (CMD) because it seems NDs take more time to explain (treatment, etc.) and look at the lifestyle as a whole, even though I know that Chinese medicine is probably even more holistic (and mystical to me) if you look at the body’s qi, etc.; it is also nice that extended health insurance covers the services of a ND (probably because they are registered and governed by a body), but not of a CMD. Would I have seen a Chinese doctor for my baby’s eczema without nudging from my mother-in-law? Probably not. Especially not because of the cost and because we are already seeing a dermatologist (and thus East meets or conflicts with West?) and because our first outgrew most of hers. Admittedly, with only one treatment so far, it seems to be more effective in speedy results compared with the continued steroid / cortisone use (which I don’t want to rely on anyway); I just don’t know if there are going to be side effects or if the problem will come back and I wasn’t told what the products would do so it feels like she expects me to trust her in blind faith. I know baby skin and bodies are just so much more sensitive than our adult ones, and because it absorbs everything like a sponge and their little systems are still growing, I still have reservations on whether we made the right choice – maybe it’s an answered prayer since it coincided around the same time. So maybe the $220+ will be worthwhile ($100 for consultation fee, $50 for the packets and $70 cream…<em>yipes</em>), but maybe not. I guess like all areas where I have little knowledge in, this is where some faith comes into play; I may have faith in God, but I trust him so it comes easier than faith in mankind.]]>

		<p>				crunchy” spectrum; BB, I would likely have been comfortable with any doctor recommendation [ref]like using steroids, no question asked[/ref], having an epidural, ensuring a hospital birth, and using products with petroleum jelly (i.e. Vaseline). Now AB, I find myself looking for natural solutions first, feeling more comfortable with mama cloth[ref]if you really want to know, look it up[/ref], and have settled on a cloth diaper routine that works with our lifestyle[ref]we’re neither organic, nor vegan or vegetarian though[/ref]. I would probably say we have a hybrid diapering approach: cloth diapering at home during the day, and disposables overnight and when away for more than 3 hours at time.
A few months ago, someone from the a local shop came to the midwives’ new baby time to chat about cloth diapering and babywearing. Like the mommy-jargon, there’s plenty of diapering lingo too, like “stink[ref]the way the diapers smell if it’s saturated or has residue in it, even after washing – though I still don’t know what ‘barnyard stink’ is – probably a good thing[/ref] “, “strip[ref]to clean out any residue in attempts to solve a smell or repelling/leaking problem – I’ve been using unconcentrated blue dawn from the dollar store[/ref]”, “pockets” or “prefolds”[ref]type of cloth diapers[/ref]. After seeing her demonstrate a few diapering options, I think if I had gone into cloth diapering from scratch[ref]then again, if we weren’t passed down a set, we probably would’ve only gone with disposables[/ref] and <a href="http://www.kellyscloset.com/Basic-Types-of-Cloth-Diapers-and-How-to-Choose-the-Right-One-for-Your-Family_ep_211-1.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">did some research</a>, I would have ended up with prefolds because it seems the most economic and you don’t have to toss the diaper cover in the wash after every change (only the inside cloth needs to be laundered), especially if it isn’t soiled or wet, a system similar to what my mom used with us when we were younger [ref]hers would likely have been classified as flats[/ref] (I still use her diapers cloths as burp cloths and to absorb leaking breastmilk). However, we were passed down a set of Bum Genius hook and loop closure (i.e. Velcro but I think that name is trademarked) diapers with inserts, so we’ve stuck with the same type of diapers in our stash – which probably is easier to use for dad and when there is help. I didn’t even know these were considered pocket diapers until much later. However, I’ve moved away from stocking velcro-based diapers, because they stick to each other and they seem to wear out faster.
Maybe I am not as meticulous when it comes to taking care of our stuff, but now they are well-used and well-loved in comparison to looking like-new when we first received them (they have been through one child prior). Because the elastics in the legs are also getting more and more relaxed, I’ve designated these to our toddler and ended buying more diapers to add to my collection, but they’re not brand-name diapers and they’re all snap-based instead of velcro. They seem harder to put on and take off, but they don’t seem to wear out as quickly either. I have also added bamboo diapers and inserts into my collection, and while they seem more soft and absorbent than my microfleece diapers and inserts, stains seem harder to wash out from natural fibers than synthetics. Because we’re using the bamboo diapers with our baby, I’m new to EBF stains that turn blue and green after a wash/dry cycle – can’t wait for some sunny weather to see if sunlight will help. Thankfully stains don’t affect function, just the aesthetics. Since I didn’t spend more than $5 per diaper-insert set, I’m also not too concerned about needing to sell them again after we no longer use them so the stains aren’t a big deal.]]>		</p>
