“Are you okay?! Why are your eyes red? And, those bags!”–after seeing me on Friday with the burnt-out look from enduring the week (great: just what a girl wants to hear from a guy!). Got my Engl in-class paper back; mark as expected and yeah, seems like prof doesn’t mind descriptive essays (as opposed to analytical). This week’s midterms: 1st–okay as mentioned last entry; 2nd–brutal.</p>




<p>Naturally woke up at 6:45 am on Friday morning at begun my day. Impressive. <br> Well, not to mention that in the middle of the night, I awoke for the 2nd night in a row to find my computer shut-off so at 6h45, I proceeded to try to fiddle around with cable and blowing dust out of the way to see if I could boot up (would not power on w/o me opening case previous day). Miracously, after I few minutes of poking and prodding, it booted. Later on in the morning, PT took a look at it and couldn’t really give much of a diagnostic ‘cept that Marcy seems to have installed my HDD upside down and with the wrong srews, also not at an optimal spot (beside floppy, which may have less room to cool).
</p>




<p>Sought free legal counsel on Friday over some ethical/legal dilemma. Helps to have a soon-to-be-lawyer friend doing a specialisation in Property Law. Thanks, Chris :).
</p>




<p>Ever read this <a href="javascript:OpenWindow('tragedy.html')">story</a>? Well, I’m the girl today. No, I won’t commit suicide and no, my parents are not divorced. Nor, do I even live with my parents, ‘cept, I live in a house where even if I take a full water-blown shower, I hear the voices of those around me, over the steady stream of water, yelling and violently moving objects around day in and day out. And, not to mention that they’re not even married yet (although they’re practically joined at the hip)! Take that, and multiply it by 60, and you’ll get the married state. I sincerely hope I won’t be that way. I wouldn’t know what to do (‘cept maybe cry and I’d likely call it off if I haven’t reached the altar point). Don’t they feel embarassed for others to see/hear them in this state? Jon suggests that I close my door and turn on my music really loudly. I don’t know if that’s gonna work, if the shower doesn’t. It’s no wonder those people complain about the yelling coversations they hear downstairs!</p>




<p>
Yep, the above image is the WRX-STi, one of the two posters I got at the auto show in TO. Looking through the pile of car brochures/etc., I must say that I am truly impressed at Mitsubishi’s marketing ideas. The image on the right belongs to the cover of the booklet: ’03 Mitsubishi Full Line (original colors a l’il different). Clearly standing out from the rest, the target audience is directed at career and young adults. And, coming from a background in information design and experience in analysing the rhetoric of text and image, I would say, they have done a very effective job with the images, text, and the colours. Definitely a good sample of well-done design; a booklet worth keeping! Good stationary (Sanford/Uni-Ball), good bags (best bag of the bunch at the car show), good cars, and good marketing! 🙂</p>




<p>
Ah, you may be wondering how I have all these pics. Well, guess what? I FINALLY got my camera back (as of Friday, Feb 28th, 2003 after bringing it in on December 12, 2002 @ 7:35 PM). I also know the guy’s name who useta own my cell number: Kevin Scott and he useta live on King St. N. Scary, isn’t it?–how FS just assumes you are the same person as long as you give them your phone number. So, anyhow, after almost 3 months, they have the nerve to lose the paperwork and cannot explain what was wrong with my camera. I took matter into my own hands and e-mailed Fuji. Their reply? “<i>We were authorized to proceed with the repairs on February the 12 and the repairs were completed on the 14th. We repaired the electronic circuit.</i>” <b>TWO days!</b> The repair took a mere two days, not even the estimated two weeks as Fuji previously mentioned. And the process was dragged out for more than 11 weeks!? Another letter of complaint (to Neil Henry, the store manager–yes, <a href="http://www.jasonchan.ca" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jason</a>, the store manager IS caucasian) is in order. By the way, what does the electronic circuit do? Anyone care to explain?</p>




<p>Lastly, my l’il godsis has been buggin’ me to put up a song on my page, just like hers, jasys, eumings, and everyone else as of late. I am not planning to jump on the bandwagon as of yet, but if you’d like to, here’s a list of functional links to .wma songs.</p>

The cold war that lasted about 2 days is gone, I hope. Guns were not involved; my throat was, no thanks to Leon 😐 (He deserves another pilsbury smack–next time! haha, jon thinks we’re quite vicious). No, I didn’t use GK’s med advice in downing as much Vit C (so that my feet will turn orange) because I don’t have any, but instead, I drank tons of honeyed ginger tea (doesn’t taste as bad as it sounds).
</li>

My camera is back waiting for me a fS! w00t! at last, lemme see, 11 weeks..almost 3 months! it better last me this time as my warranty is as good as gone and i hope the warrantyed repair isn’t a poor job either. I shall remember to inquire (what’s the diff btwn inquire and enquire?) what took them so long
and what was wrong w my camera…I can’t wait til Thurs, when Yam can kindly drive me there (thanks!) :).
</li>





Yes, so as reading week finished, I have this brutal week to look forward to: 2 midterms, 2 assignments, and 1 group project report, all due before this comin’ Saturday (latest) and 32% of one course mark lies on Thursday. I would almost say it’s “hell week” but it’s not because I’m sure hell is a lot worse than this, and nor do I wanna stick around to find out either.
At least reading week was enjoyable with food, ice-skating, <i>How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days</i> (shame how what may be “good-lookin'” ppl tend to be so superficial, in real life and on screen)–even Marcy enjoyed the chic flick, but I’ve really had enough of PMall and all-you-can-eat Korean BBQ at the restaurant on Silver Star Drive. We spent at least 10 hrs there combined w/in the last 2 weekends (the guys playing initial-d, some foolin around on the DDR/paraparadise machines, and the girls or myself, just chatting and walking around…during the second weekend, i got bored enuff to wander off to market village while they were at orbitz). Did I also mention the $90+ bill that we got at emerald city restaurant in sauga when the 6 of us had dim sum there? Ouch (and I didn’t even eat any of the crab or shrimp dishes!).
Weekend finished with a rental at Thrifty (another Liberty for price of Neon) to take to St. Jacob’s. Once we got outta the car, Marc balked at the smell. Welcome to “Langley/Abbotsford, BC” — the smell of home hahah…I think in the Outlet Mall, we only went crazy in one store (more like Marc did hehe)…of all stores… the Corningware store! Oh boy, do I ever feel old. Whenever my parents go into stores like that, I just browse in other stores…never understanding how plates, pots, and pans can ever be that interesting! Apparently, I guess I’ve grown up in the last 8 months. We ate lunch at a restaurant that served really tasty food (I’ve never had such good pasta in awhile) for a good price. Ironically, the place was called Benjamin’s Restaurant and Inn (since the last person I went to St. Jacob’s with was indeed him). Risking stormy weather, Chris came down on Sunday to visit and it was enjoyable, although most of the time, I was semi-cramming so I didn’t really keep him company. Dinner was “interesting”; I risked my health trying the Viet restaurant which changed name like 4 times–tho’ the management seems to have changed too b/c those waitresses sure looked Flip…nevertheless, i’m still not going to be suggesting that restaurant next time someone asks me what is good around here.
Now, I better stop procrastinating..=|]]>

We acknowledge receipt of your email describing the events that took place on the above mentioned flights and thank you for them. Your comments are appreciated and will be used to correct and improve our service.
</p>



<p>
Last December 20th, unforseen technical problems affected our flight schedule which resulted delayed departures on your flights. JetsGo is aware of the impact this situation had on your Christmas holidays and sincerely refrets any inconvenience you experienced due to this schedule change. Please rest assured that this is not indicative of the standard of service we usually provide to our passenger.
</p>



<p>
Every effort is made to minimize delays and while we sympathize with this situation <b>we are unable to comply with your request for compensation</b>.
</p>



<p>
Once again we apologize for this inconvenience and look forward to the opportunity of serving you again under better circumstances.
</p>



<p>
Sincerely yours,<br>
Louise Delaney<br>
Customer Service
</p>



<p>
Yeah right, we’ll see. Funny, how my friend received the EXACT same letter, except it was addressed to Mrs. Chang. I guess she must be married to her father as well. So after two months, I finally hear from Jetgso again–this time via snail mail. As expected, they don’t really care for customer satisfaction. I hope Beckster got some form of compensation because afterall, it was HER luggage that was delayed.
</p>



<p>
On another note. I had no idea that MSN messenger restricts the size of your contact list. Today, I got a message saying that my list was too large (149?) and I had to eliminate some ppl before I could add another…interesting…</p>

<a href="http://community.webshots.com/user/waly_lime" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a>The break began with the Toronto International Auto Show in, where else, TO…well, since it was my first time, I didn’t really know what to expect (but my $18 had better be worth it!). Eunie went ga-ga in there, running around like a l’il kid in a candy store 🙂 Apart from the crowd, the place looked like a giant car dealership…with all the cars available for one to admire, examine, see and touch (ahhh, the new car smell!). The freebies? Not too much cept for the standard car dealership brochures, and 1 poster.
</p>



<p>
Ah, my JVC digicam story enters here:
</p>



<p>
On Friday, the 14th (happy bday Sandra C.), I physically showed my face at fS and asked for the store manager. The customer service rep (Jen, whom I dealt with multiple times now as of today), diverted my search for him and thus, persuaded me to purchase a open box camera, use it for the weekend and promptly return it after. Since, she promised to call Chantal at the Distribution Centre on Monday, I took her word for it (and yes, she delivered her promise, even calling me twice this week to tell me that she couldn’t reach Chantal and finally, that Chantal got back to her and the package is now currently fixed an in transit). One question continues to nag me–will she get the comission even after I refund my purchase? Because if she does, she sure does not deserve it. Well, maybe she does, since she’s actively tried to help me, but no one at that particular Future Shop should get any of it.
</p>



<p>
Anyhow, for $400+, the guy at the digcam dept recommended an OB cam for my perusal and for the lowest price, I got a 3.3 megapixel, 3X optical zoom, video w sound recording capabilities, and li-ion rechargable batteries JVC digicam. Mental note: If I am ever to purchase another digicam, make sure batteries will last beyond 50 pictures and that the flash works well.
</p>



<p>
I’m not entirely sure whether the cam was already scratched or not, but upon closer examination at the end of the weekend, the area surrounding the viewfinder was scratched (ahem, maybe from me accidentally dropping it on hardwood floor at the autoshow – eeps, although thankfully, nothing was broken and the cam was still fully functional b/c i sure did not want to keep it; note to all you camera holders: do not let me carry your camera  around unless you want me to take only 1 shot b/c i seem to be a klutz). Anyhow, I rushed to the nearest FS (Gloucester) and asked for a refund before I do any more damage to it. The stoopid rep (can’t spell my name, and has never heard of Waterloo) asked me if there was anything wrong w the camera, and I said that there was a minor scratch…she took a look at it, and uttered in almost disbelief, “that’s it?!” (as if a scratch wasn’t enough reason to ask for a refund), gave a quick glance over to see if everything was there (didn’t check to see if SM card or battery was even present), and promptly gave me my money back. I left the store feeling a lot less worried for I had successfully taken that burden off my hands.
</p>



<p>
Now, I hope to hear from Conestoga FS sometime soon because “in transit” is supposed to take only 1-2 days, tho’ Jen admits that she forgot to clarify with Chantal what “in transit” means–to the Distribution Centre from Fuji or to FS from the Distribution Centre…and now, the lesson of the last 3 months is: take action into your own hands when dealing with big corporate stores, for if you do not, you shall never see your product again. Yes, with my persistent inquires, I uncovered a malfunctional and misleading DBMS and slow to reply reps. I am guessing that if I never e-mailed Fuji, FS would’ve never realised to authorize the order from Fuji because their DB had said that it was already fixed and parts were replaced.
Sigh…I should’ve done it sooner. Tho’ I guess, better late than never…now, I’m trying to see who I can write to at FS to complain about their poor customer service…

<p>
Ah yes, finally heard from someone who has chosen to remain silent for about a year or so…hrm, maybe my dreams really do reveal hints (or my inner desires haha–and no, I do not desire to kill Lexia as I have done so in my dream).</p>

      Them: It’s X and Y from downstairs.<br>
      Me: (Er, okay?!) Hold on… (rush to get Eunie to open door)
      

</p><p>
      E: Hi?<br>
      Them: Hi, we live under you and we’d wanted to come by all term to tell you this, but could you please quiet down? We hear yelling, and running around and our whole apartment shakes, and do you guys move like furniture or something? We can’t sleep because it bothers us til like 3 AM.<br>
      E: Really? Where does it come from?<br>
      One of them: I live in the room beside the bathroom.<br>
      E: Oh, okay, I’ll tell my housemate. Sorry about that. (closes door)
      </p>



<p>
      E: (to me) Yo, you better pipe down “housemate”. Stop YELLING. <br>
      (We erupt in laughter).<br>
      Me: What do we move? (proceed to open and close my drawers, turn on my music, and move my chair) And yelling? G and I must get into fights and run around the small area that we do have playing cat and mouse…tho’ I suppose my room is more echoey than hers since it’s bigger and has less furniture to absorb sound. Tho’, I have lived here 4 years and no one has yet complained nor have I complained because of the cheap paper thin walls/ceilings/floors that we live and put up with daily in exchange for cheap rent. (Last term, DD asked me if the guy upstairs was bowling, it was quite amusing). I can hear the guy peeing upstairs loud and clear (only about 4 times a day–I guess he doesn’t drink enuff fluids)…maybe we should go upstairs and complain that he pees too loudly? <br>
      E: (idea!) Hey, you got a bucket? Let’s collectively go to the can together…<br>
      (More laughter)<br>
      (Soon, I get bored, and return to my work)
      </p>



<p>
      10 mins later…<br>
       *Knock, knock*..pause..knocks louder<br>
      (D’oh! Eunie is out, I put on a T and answer the door).<br>
      Me: Hi?<br>
      Them: Hi, we were just here, and we talked to your housemate 5 mins ago.<br>
      Me: Oh? There’s no one home but me. I was in my room studying. What’s up?<br>
      Them: Are you the one that lives next to the bathroom?<br>
      Me: Yes??<br>
      Them: We hear a lot of noise coming from your apartment til like 3 AM all the time. Tho’ maybe it isn’t your apartment (but after much investigation, it appparently is)..and from your room.<br>
	  Me: Noise? I was just studying…and I’m usually asleep by 3 AM…(I sleep around 2-2h30ish)<br>
	  Them: Were you playing music just now? And we heard parts of conversations…sounds like you were yelling.<br>
	  Me: Yelling? There’s no one here…most of the time no one is home. I just study…tho’ I was playing music..(pauses)..can you hear?<br>
	  Them: (Strains to hear the music that is playing softly in my room). Yeah, actually, it’s not the music that bothers us…it’s more like furniture moving. Do you move furniture around a lot?<br>
	  Me: Furniture?!<br>
      Them: Chair maybe?<br>
      Me: Oh yeah, well, I do sit on a chair and I get up every so often..that may be it, since it has no wheels so it may scrape the floor.<br>
      Them: Doesn’t your room have carpet? (to absorb any sound)<br>
      Me: (I give them an incredulous look as if they are from outer space) Nooo….<br>
      Them: Oh. Well, um, it greatly bothers us. Would you try to keep it down? We don’t want to bring in the DM (Division Manager).<br>
      Me: Oh, okay, what time do you sleep? I’ll try and see what I can do…so sorry bout that.<br>
      Them: 11 pm. S’okay, glad to have talked to you because we didn’t know what to say.<br>
      Me: Thanks, gnite. (door closes).
      </p>



<p>
      E: HAHAHAHA….you’re too loud! Yo, sit in another chair, stop sittin in the one that you’re in..they’re gonna complain…(so I steal Yam’s $2.15 computer chair to solve this problem temporarily)….
      Well, I’m guessing they’re new to WCRI. Welcome to cheap student housing. Oh, the guy upstairs just went pee again and hrm, that’s funny. I always hear him pee, a flush..but never the tap water…does he not wash his hands after?! EEEEW.
</p>



<p>Update: Think it was good tonight, until Kit came home and I proceeded to tell her what happened. Kit, being like-minded, unconsciously raised her voice, faked DDR, and we laffed SOOO hard…and…DM came up and spoke to Kit (she opened door) about the noise level complaints..mentioned something about being quiet and not even walking with slippers on because we don’t have carpet (excuuuse me?? WCRI didn’t provide us w carpet, so what are we to do?!)…after 11 pm on weeknights (..which leaves…weekends free! muhahah)…but then how on earth does he expect us to walk around!?
      </p>

      Note: w00t! by the grace of God, He passed me on my CS midterm! Some were just stupid careless mistakes I did, like in the definitions section, I changed the right answer to the wrong one and in another question, I forgot to include a command line, which I normally would remember to do. Other answers, especially in the section I counted on losing most of my marks on, must have been divinely inspired. As I looked over my solutions today, I had no idea why I wrote those (correct) answers down or how I derived them.</p>

Thus, I blog; I share encouraging answered prayers, of the short prayer I offered up towards the heavens in the afternoon of the Columbia incident. No, I did not follow the lead of the American leaders, praying for the already lost, but rather for the families, and for hope to those affected. Yet, my spirit only paused a short moment to wonder the fate of the perished souls, grieving for the lives lost for eternity. Romans 1:28, 31 correctly emphasizes the plight of man, “<i>Furthermore, since they did not think it worthwhile to retain the knowledge of God, he gave them over to a depraved mind, to do what ought not to be done…they are <b>senseless</b>, faithless, heartless, ruthless.</i>” Senseless: “mo zhi” (as translated in Cantonese). Day in, day out, media shows clips of violence, sex, hatred, bitterness and war against fellow man, and the hearts of the viewers are hardened, detached, distant, and desensitized to the graphical images and the implications that follow them. And, although the tragedy occupied over 10 hours of television airtime on virtually every channel, just two days later, the war on Iraq was once again the top headlines on CNN. In the brief minute where my spirit paused to ponder, incomphrensibly, I grieved for these 7 people even more so than over my grandfather’s death, for I knew his eternity was secured in Christ Jesus.
</p>



<p>
Some days passed without further thought or incident, but on a particular day, as I was routinely cleaning out my inbox, an e-mail forward captivated my attention. Steve Green, a Christian artist shared  about his friendship with Rick Husband, the captain of the mission and crew on board the Columbia. As a Christian, Rick prayed for the crew before departure, and actively witnessed to those working around him. As I read those words, a familiar sense of doubt crept into my mind, for afterall, aren’t e-mail forwards 99% of the time spam, junk, or urban legends? On the verge of dismissing another rumour, I quickly typed in “Rick Husband Steve Green” on Google, the ever-reliable search engine. After 5 minutes of searching for valid links, I ended up back at CNN. This time, I read the <a href="http://www.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0302/04/cct.00.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">transcript</a> of an interview with Connie Chung on her Tonight show. Steve did not only receive an e-mail from outer space from Rick, but as a consequence of what happened, he also openly got a chance to proclaim Rick’s faith in God, and the audience had the opportunity to hear a clip of <a href="javascript:OpenWindow('http://www.pwarchive.com/song.aspx?SongID=168&Visited=1&Font=10&HideChords=1&Print=1&SearchText=')">God of Wonders</a>, a song that Rick’s wife chose to play to the astronauts to wake them up in the morning, a song with such suiting lyrics (I do imagine that I’ll sing this song with a different perspective the next time its played at worship)! His children will likely cherish the last videos, prepared by their father so they could “do” devotions with them each day that he was gone.
</p>



<p>
Thus, I am certain that lives are changed and touched by Rick Husband, Mike Anderson, and another astronaut’s living testimonies even though they are no longer on earth. And by that, all men will know that they are His disciples. And, although I had no intentions of dedicating an entire journal entry to this incident, as I would be following the footsteps of those before me, I end with no regrets.</p>

Hrm, ’tis <i>has</i> been a while since I’ve last entered something; ppl have begun to ask what’s wrong. I guess if you don’t see me bloggin’, you’ll know I’ve been busy…. Actually, it’s all good. I’ve scared myself into thinking that I had two assignments due today, but it was actually only 1 and 1 tomorrow instead. Now, I just gotta remember to print it out :P. Ah, I just found out recently that the tool that I useta surf with on the web (that blocks off any sign of my presence–trust me, I checked on my stats) has been improved greatly–mwahahah, which allows me freedom to visit friends’ blogs multiple times in a day w/o them knowing my surfing patterns!–even has a referral blocker, and any link from the visited site is also untraceble :).

One thing I learnt this week: I am glad that I’m not a CS major. ‘Tis so intimidating to walk into the back of a room, peer around, and learn that it’s full of guys–namely tech geeks–the ENTIRE room populated with only males! In my entire lifetime (and w/ all the guy friends I am useta hangin’ out w), I have never felt this “weird”–like I didn’t belong? Thus, upon my curiousity in checking out the C# .NET presentation as I happened to walk by the conference room was quickly diminished. Isn’t any girl curious about what that is all about!? Boo.

Bringing back the spiritual aspect of my life. We had Bible study in my Cantonese group today. Although most of them had nothing to say (as usual), the passage really stuck out to me. Paul (the author) says this about the Jews: “<i>You [the Jews] who brag about the [Jewish] law, do you dishonor God by breaking the law? As it is written: “God’s name is blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you.</i>” (Romans 2:23-24). I think we can apply what Paul wrote today…I keep thinking, how many of those who are unbelievers see us, as “professing” Christians give God a bad name/rep b/c of our actions, which leads to hypocrisy…=|

As I was writing in my diary the other day to record down some interesting observations I’ve noted, I came across some entries, that upon hindsight, are truly quite amusing. Guess what? Today is your lucky day! You, as the reader, get to see what goes on in the mind of a frosh (my second entry as a frosh–[] are today’s additions/clarifications; names have been shortened for privacy reasons):
98 Sept 21st: University of Waterloo</p>



<p>
Did I ever tell you about the 3 guys [Singapore exchange: 23 years old, one was single for sure, the other I can’t remember but I vaguely recall him having a gf back home] that came up to me durin’ a dinner time [in res] (I was alone) and out-of-the-blue one of them asks, “Are you a Christian?” [<a href="javascript:%20OpenWindow('f98.html')">see related: V1 caf</a>] I say yes, introductions are exchanged n’ they end up checkin’ out CCF b/c I just happened to be goin’ there next. NEwayz, they’re hilarious! One guy sees a girl I know n’ asks her if she speaks Mandarin…then later on says that she’s pretty. Too bad she already has a boyfriend (handsome too he thinks [this was a guess on his part]). Anyway, on Sunday, the other guys asks him if he noticed C @ church beside E (that girl)–‘no’ came the reply. Funny was: “How could you have noticed E and not C?!!” It was hilarious hearin’ them speak of those 2 (he likes C’s eyes)–but the other thinks she’s [C] rebellious b/c of her dyed hair–gracious!, guys are so superficial–that just proves my point EXACTLY 🙂</p>

Last night, CCF had a bible study. What struck me most, was that I was in no hurry for it to finish this time–even though we went 1/2 hour overtime. I overheard of our group members noting that as the bible study came to a close, and I thought to myself, “Wow, we’re in such a rush to get through the material these days, even if there is “substance” to them. In Jesus’ time and in certain countries of the world, people crave to hear God’s word, even if it means sitting through lunch or dinner.” I was encouraged tho, because as I stayed behind to fellowship with the people (note that next to everyone went home for Chinese New Year, so the group size was VERY small–60 or less? perfect size: reminds me of the past years. I actually stayed til the end until everyone was cleaning up–haven’t done that for a LONG time now), one brother noted that he actually learnt something in bible study this time. Then, he started cracking up because what he said sounded bad, but I was encouraged nevertheless, as he even admitted that most bible studies bore him to death. When I asked him what he learnt, I knew that he really thought about what was “passed” out as  “food for thought” in his group. As for myself, I took a new perspective in looking at the structure of Ephesians 4. Because I normally read Ephesians 4 either on my Palm or in the Bible, I never noticed that the entire chapter echoes Colossians 3:12-14 where it says, “<i>Therefore, as God’s chosen people, holy and dearly loved, clothe yourselves with compassion, kindness, humility, gentleness and patience. Bear with each other and forgive whatever grievances you may have against one another. Forgive as the Lord forgave you. And over all these virtues put on love, which binds them all together in perfect unity.</i>” Like two kaiser buns holding a sandwich together, Ephesians 4 begins with, “<i>Be completely humble and gentle; be patient, bearing with one another in love.</i>” (v2) and ends with “<i>“Be kind and compassionate to one another, forgiving each other, just as in Christ God forgave you.</i>” (v32). I thought that was kinda neat. And, to those that were in my bible study group (Deb, if you’re reading this, that means you), my apologies: we didn’t study Eph 4 in the bible study at the retreat in 2001, but rather Colossians 3:12-17. I realised my mistake shortly after I found related notes on my Palm regarding Christian community. Oops. Actually, I didn’t realise that there were actually two different passages on “bearing” with one another–I remember that in 2001, I recalled those words sticking out from the page, “Bear with each other”…and thinking, “in trying to love someone, the first step is to “bear” with them…”
</p>



<p>
Anyhow, I’m likely making no sense to you, as the reader, but that’s okay, because I was just trying to articulate to/remind myself what I learnt on Friday. Ah yes, fellowshipping w Pearlo, DanTe, and Ricky afterwards was a new and different, but nevertheless positive experience. Ahh, the joys of having “intimate” conversations with smaller groups. Yep =)–so who won? Lakers?! Hahaha.
</p>



<p>
Oh, 23 minutes over bedtime. And I gotta finish my readings too…heheh.</p>
