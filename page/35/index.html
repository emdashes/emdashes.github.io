		<p>				When iGoogle came out, I thought it was a novel idea. Now, I can’t get it to go away. It is like a permanent fixture, always hijacking my IE7 homepage. It seems to go away temporarily when I remove it from my homepage settings, but after I restart my computer, it comes back. I’ve also uninstalled Google Desktop and deleted all references to iGoogle in the registry, just in case that did something, but to no avail.</p>




<p>Does anyone know what is going on? Maybe some of you <a href="http://virtualawrence.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Microsoft</a> or Google geeks/techies/fans might know?</p>

</p><li><b>Buffalo:</b> short line up at the borders even though the dollar was on par! Spent $270 across 4 of us and didn’t get taxed at the border. Found out that if you have a express border pass, there is this one border 5 minutes away from the Rainbow Bridge crossing that allows you to go through without having to stop and minimal to no wait time (we didn’t qualify for that).</li>




<li><b>Niagara Falls:</b> Fallsview Casino no longer has free parking, even if you dine there. You need to spend a minimum on your card (gambling), but when asked what this “minimum” is, they do not know. We tried to spend 50 cents on the slots, won back 75 cents, and still did not get free parking. The Golden Lotus is a great value and one of the better Chinese buffets in Canada that I have had in awhile (being one who isn’t too fond of sweets, I went to the dessert table three times)!</li>

<li><b>Montreal:</b> Having been here two weeks back, I found it much easier to navigate around the city. Sleeping here was peaceful as we had a 2 bedroom suite, but j.w’s blanket had what looked like to be fresh blood (what’s with Montreal accommodations and blood?). Apart from the traditional Montreal must-have foods (crepes, Montreal bagels, Schwartz), the preserved vegetables, shredded duck vermicelli soup in Chinatown was really good (me thinks it was @ Restaurant Beijing) – only available on the Chinese menu, not the English/French one (when the server heard us speaking in Chinese, they gave us the Chinese menu). The Lantern Festival at the Jardin Botanique was worth the admission price to the garden alone.</li>




<li><b>Quebec (City):</b> The Quebecois don’t seem to pronounce the “re”s when they say “quatre” (sounds like cat) or “timbre” (sounds like temp)…once you venture outside Old Quebec’s walls, some people know very little English – they had the hardest time understanding what “postal stamps” meant; this was a time when my French phrasebook would’ve helped, especially since that word was in there! By the end of the 4 days there, I was able to understand more than when I had arrived – so perhaps, if I stayed there for a month, I would be able to keep a conversation going. This was my favourite segment of the trip: the leaves were an assortment of gold, orange, and reds, and walking around town just felt peaceful – and beautiful. I could’ve done without the experience of the <a href="http://www.hotelsjaro.com/palaceroyal/index-en.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">4-star hotel</a> having no running water for a night!</li>




<li><b>Montreal:</b> Passed through to pick up 3 lbs of Schwartz’s for friends.</li>

<li><b>Ottawa:</b> Thanksgiving with family! Just driving around Orleans often brought me flashbacks to my first summer in Ottawa – remembering the days with <a href="http://silq.blogspot.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SilQ</a>, Marcy, Dom (the only ones I knew that lived that far as well).  They changed the Canadian Hall/Exhibit at the Museum of Civilization a bit, but I still enjoyed it as usual.</li>




<li><b>Rockport/<a href="http://www.boldtcastle.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Boldt Castle</a> (1000 Islands): </b>Encountered bus loads of Chinese tourists. The inside of the castle is more run down than what I had remembered – rather disappointing. Especially since the outside of the playhouse was also closed (due to construction). At least we took some pictures. Prior to this, took the advice of my friend Lynn and filled up gas in the cheapest town on the way for 87.1c/L.</li>




<li><b>The Big Apple: </b> On the way back, we stopped at the Big Apple to pick up some pies. They were also bus loads of Chinese tourists, so many that pies were running out! Stuck in traffic from 1000 Islands to Toronto: took 4 hours, instead of 2+.</li>

		<p>				Was going to walk across this semi narrow dirt mound across to the other side (if you fell, you’d fall a few stories). An older guy with a red shirt asked me where it would take him to because it appeared that he wasn’t too sure of himself (frankly, I wasn’t either) but I did tell him that itd take him to this really fun slide. 

And the slide turned out as I had expected – long, enclosed, took you down a few floors. It was like a waterslide, only without the water. By the time I got to the bottom, I asked the guy what he thought and he said “you’re/it’s pretty cool” and went on to join his peers. Turns out he was with a whole bunch of gamers (ppl who met in a different room playing some random board games, like settlers). 

When I reached the top again, I saw a few ppl I knew including Ann, Caroline, Susanne and Melody. Somehow Vivian ended up being with me and we left in my aunt Shan’s van. But I wanted to be dropped off close to the entrance of the building soI got out after grabbing my knapsack and confirming I had my purse. 

The place had what looked like a restaurant in it. I went and as I went to the what seemed like the fifth floor. There I went to the back, looked out and saw what looked like minima and Jenny behind a mound of grass. So, I called out, “andrew!” And he looked over and was in the middle of greeting him (was asking him what he was doing here – I was in a place that wasn’t toronto, vancouver, or seattle – had the impression that I was in quebec or something because Viv had wanted to go to a Metro station). I think he was here for Ivanita’s wedding. Anyhow, it looked like Jenny was upset at the interruption – I guess she was trying to talk to him about something serious so she started to walk/run away. So I decided to forget it and run back towards the back entrance/patio. Anyhow, they ended up catching up with me, and then started with, “do you remember last year how you asked me how I knew/if I was ready?” And back then, Jenny was, he wasn’t. 

He began telling me their story and then slowly, some people came over that I knew, asking if I was married yet – Auntie Eliza, Auntie Foggy (Flora) and someone led to talking about Gideon fellowship. Someone showed me a pic of the past Gideon fellowship and I saw Mur and Jon D in it. Asked me whether I was in it back then and chokingly remembered why I wasn’t:  I wasn’t allowed. 

Later exited the place after saying hi to a few others like Mur (turns out Albe was there too, which was a surprise), and it was on the 5th floor. Took the elevator down while someone else took the slide down. </p>

		<p>				H&P. At the last wedding, I had an infusion of Japanese and Taiwanese (Chinese) Canadian culture. This one? French Canadian Chinese. At the last one, I ended my post with “I want to learn Japanese!”. This one? I wouldn’t mind learning French either – I keep getting caught up with the pronunciation. I find it especially neat to hear Chinese people speak English with a French accent and speak Chinese with a French accent (and them not knowing it and when pointed out, in denial).</p>




<p>Last time we came to Montreal (I would use Alt-130 and use proper accent formatting, but I don’t know if the RSS reader would mess up again), we had a semi-fluent French speaking tour guide/friend (who just happened to be P) with us; this time, we had us (though, on Saturday aft, j.w and I met up with a French speaking friend at were able to enjoy a pommes, canelle, et frommage suisse crepe and squeak by the meal without having to order in English).</p>




<p>The <i>auberge</i> (French for “inn” but it is more of an hostel) was better than expected, but more disappointing than I had hoped.  But for $99 for 4 people in centre-ville (downtown), with 4 beds (two on the top floor, and two were in the attic that was connected to the room) and included breakfast, I can hardly complain. $7 for 24hr parking near the bibliotheque nationale (library) was a great deal as well. The inside of it was mostly renovated, giving it a clean, newish look, but my bed sheets weren’t as clean as I had liked (and that was the clincher for making me not want to come back): blood(?) stains, a scab, and pieces of who knows what. They did make your bed the next day (though it was merely the same sheets). The service was friendly and helpful and even though the washrooms were limited (2 for 2 floors), the shower pressure was perfect (and soft water too!). I loved the breakfast: fresh, hot croissants straight from their oven: with melted butter. Mmm.</p>




<p>I liked the church’s (a former Anglican church?) acoustics, with the high ceilings and all. H&P picked a great team: we haven’t played together before and had less than 24 hours to practice and learn a song in French but I was really surprised at how well it turned out, and how well everyone else sang.</p>

<p>One of the more memorable experiences was when we stumbled into Marche Atwater looking for some <a href="http://www.chocolatsgg.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">chocolats</a> that P gave me one time (and that I almost consumed in one sitting). Marche Atwater is an indoor and outdoor market reminding me of a farmer’s market. French was everywhere! We spent a good ten minutes or so trying to decide what kind of chocolates to buy; one kind that stood out to me were <i>les bluets du lac</i> – fresh blueberries dipped in chocolate. 100g were $9.99! Crazy pricey, but worth a try. The rest were $1.75 ($2 with tax) per cube.</p>




<p>We stopped at <a href="http://www.premieremoisson.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Premiere Moisson</a> on the way out – a recommendation from Jackson: a bread, cake and pastry shop. The line up was long, but efficient. I took number 91.</p>




<p>Keeping my ears peeled, I heard what sounded like 91 in French, gave her my number and ordered the “Choco-framboise” (which turns out to be a chocolate raspberry mousse – so good!). She asked me whether I wanted it to go or for here. I didn’t fully understand her question, but like Doreen, I chose to focus on/guess the selective keywords I understood so I repeated whatever she said that was “to go” in French, which I guess she understood. Then later, I asked for “fourchette: deux” because I had no idea how to say the entire sentence 🙂 Thankfully she understood that too and gave me the two forks I wanted. I am now contemplating buying the Lonely Planet phrasebook French for my travels to Montreal and Quebec City next month.</p>

Can you remember your first year at university (long long time ago)?  For me it was a tramatic experience.  The mentoring from a senior graduate student was essential in carrying me through.  I met several second year students, who echo similar sentiments in having a senior student who took care of them.
This is a particular important time of transition for froshies, especially those who are far away from home (i.e. Vancouver).  As graduate stuents we can make a large difference by taking just a little time out to care for them.  This would be a great way to contribute to our community and pass on helpful insights to undergraduate students.



I remember my frosh experience quite vividly; I was telling them that it was the grad (and senior) students  who really made a positive impression on me – we cooked and shared meals together and played video games; they included me in their activities and spiritual discussions, helped me move, and drove me places (including the airport). I know I don’t do a very good job at returning the favour to the students now, and I’ve even asked a couple of those people how they ever had the energy to do it? (I don’t think I ever got a real answer). I don’t know if they knew it, but they were very successful at deterring me away from grad studies through their lamentations.

That’s partially how I got to be where I am today. But, backing up a few years, I think it was Chewie who was the catalyst in getting me more interested in computers in the latter years of high school (with ICQ and usa.net). Though, I suppose I always was, dabbling into DBIV in DOS (and creating a contact/address book with my aunt’s help as a child). Then <a href="http://ajmaonline.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">minima</a> with his trojan groundhog game and his infinite ping loop/script on Clara’s computer. I was fascinated at what those two things could do (to the point where I almost got into trouble). Next, there was Alan, showing me the tricks of UNIX at the wee hours of the morning (so I could figure out the school’s system and how to chat).
Then, I remember the support for RPW that came from dchsueh, which was rather surprising and kind of set me into that direction more confidently (I remember arguing with myself because it seemed so un-Chinese (Arts!=success) and not what I had wanted to do as a profession since Grade 9, but the study of literature and writing always interested me).  Now, everyone thinks I’m a technical writer, because I was lazy and didn’t bother explaining what “RPW” is…and that’s what many people from that program end up being. What I do today is part of these people’s influence (and more whom I haven’t identified) and I enjoy it for the most part! The start of my CSS and HTML knowledge? That’s thanks to <a herf="http://www.tshin.com/~dan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dtshin</a>; I tended to ask him whenever I had any HTML or CSS questions, and copy his code to learn – he was great at answering my messages.
So, you could influence someone’s future, whether you know it or not. And, I’m glad to hear that today’s graduate students realize that they can be those mentors and support peers. If they’re willing to let God use them, I am sure that they will be a blessing to others. Thinking about who influenced you may then naturally lead to the next question: who can you influence?]]>

		<p>				Tanklau was saying how I don’t blog often enough, so here’s a random observation. I got talking to Susanne during the couple of days we spent together. Turns out, I’m not the only one who gets errands done when one goes home, regardless of how few days we have. Our list includes:</p>




<ul><li>Doctor’s appointment(s)</li>




<li>Dental appointment(s)</li>




<li>Optometrist appointment(s)/purchasing eyeglasses (mine from Asian stores for $240, lens and designer frames)</li>




<li>Hair cut appointment(s) (mine? $7! And, I’m generally quite pleased at how it turns out)</li>




<li>Alterations (on clothing – e.g. pant hemming)</li>


</ul><p>The downside? Sometimes, this means that we need to wait for some months.</p>

Have you ever watched someone love something or someone so much, that it made you jealous? I do all the time…I see people who love Jesus in such a powerful and genuine way, and I get jealous. It’s not fair that you love Jesus more than I do!


As I read that, I realized that it’s not a feeling of jealousy I have, it’s more a developing feeling of…attraction…I begin to fall in love with a Jesus that I do not know as intimately. Or, am I just confusing it with being attracted to a passion for God? But I think that’s helped pinpoint and identify those feelings somewhat, at least in the past – a recipe for danger as I could misconstrue it as oh, this guy has <em>that</em> quality! Hrm, hard to express what I’m thinking, but yes, it makes sense to me :).]]>		</p>

		<p>				Another wedding, another experience.</p>




<p>Perhaps it is age, but it feels like the ceremony gets shorter and shorter. When I was last part of the bridal party (back in high school for my aunt’s wedding), I remember having to stand there on stage for what felt to be a very long time.</p>




<p>This time, I remember talking to the then bride-to-be, that she was among the last of us (our close group of high school friends) who were single, but yet, she was the first to get married.</p>




<p>Perhaps it was the build-up to the actual day, but it felt like a play – very surreal; yet, I knew it wasn’t a play – every moment of it was real. I really enjoyed the “untraditional” choice for the bridesmaids and groomsmen to wear yukatas – they were more comfortable than the evening wear and any type of other dresses I’ve ever worn (and modest too!). The best man gave me the idea to use the baggy sleeves to “hide” things in, including my camera – which I was able to carry around for most of the afternoon.</p>

<p>Congrats to M&M! From the short time spent with the Koshimura family, they seem to be a great family (for Mel) to marry into – they’re hospitable, thoughtful, very personable people, and a joy to get to know. In fact, if not for Min’s aunt/mom(?) who brought the garments over from Japan, we won’t have worn those lovely yukatas :). Hopefully Mel will find it easy to integrate into their family!</p>




<p>Now, I want to learn Japanese!</p>




<p>—-</p>




<p>Side note: I even saw people I didn’t think I’d see this time  – both my aunt’s families, chewie (and L!), my cousin Ern, and even Boy! What a blessing 🙂</p>
