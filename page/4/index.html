At the workshop, we found that he sells the starter kit for $20, so we just saved ourselves $20 – though it’s really the SCOBY that we’re after, as everything else we can easily source! Like </span><a style="font-size: 16px;" href="http://her.happyhippos.ca/2014/01/kefir-and-breast-milk/">the kefir</a><span style="font-size: 16px;"> that j.w now makes and drinks (whereby Bean happily drinks plain and gulps down the whey as if it was juice), all one needs is the active ingredient (Kefir – grains; Kombucha – SCOBY), and you’re good to go for awhile.</span>
I don’t know how my first batch will turn out; it’s sitting on another counter away from the kefir. If it’s doing what it’s supposed to be doing, the tea <del>will turn</del> is turning lighter, almost to a golden hue, as the week progresses, and a new layer of SCOBY <del>will be formed</del> is forming on top. Unlike kefir where you see a distinct separation of the “curds” and whey, there seems to be no obvious visual indicator, other than the color and that the SCOBY has formed a layer across / seal – and only if you’re paying attention. However, the final indication of both is the taste-test; if you like it, it’s ready.
Before my notes get all wrinkled and smudged, here’s what to know about kombucha:


</p><ul><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kombucha" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">kombucha</a>, Japanese in origin to mean “kelp tea” [ref]makes sense to me, since the stringy yeast on the SCOBY reminds me of kelp / seaweed at times[/ref], now it means fermented (sweet) tea. If you buy a commercial bottle in stores, you could spend anywhere from 3$ to 6$! Essentially, it’s made up of starter brew+SCOBY+brewed sweet tea.</li>


</ul><h2>Starter Brew</h2>


Fully brewed kombucha should smell like vinegar (or a faint smell if it’s not too strong), and a formula for starter brew comprises of: 1-2 cups of full brewed kombucha (the starter liquid) + SCOBY that is at least 1/8 inch thick (5oz) and should cover at least 1/2 of the surface area / opening of the jar/container/vessel, which is added to 1 gallon brewed tea; the more SCOBY you have, the more likely you will succeed. If you don’t have starter liquid, you can substitute it for a 1/4 cup of distilled vinegar.


<h2>SCOBY</h2>


What’s a SCOBY? It stands for Symbiotic Culture of Bacteria and Yeast.


<ul><li>A healthy one can look like a thin puck and it’s not unusual to see spits, holes, strands, floaties and strings of yeast[ref]edible, but most people filter it out[/ref]. When you pick it up, it should stay together and shouldn’t tear easily. A new SCOBY is beige, creamy in colour; the underside will likely look more weird than the top side, and colours of blue or purple aren’t unusual; it might sink, and that’s okay. If your container is too small for the SCOBY, it is safe to cut it up.</li>


    

<li>An older SCOBY can turn brown, work slower or stop working, but you can just keep it there in the batch. However, if you see mold on it, just scrap it and start new.   Signs of mold include powdery, dry splotches, specks in black, blue, or white; people have compared it to mold on an orange or a piece of bread.</li>


</ul><h2>Brew Environment and Equipment</h2>




<ul><li>Making an ideal brew: it thrives in 73-85F temperature, out of direct sunlight and avoid an exterior wall if possible. Don’t fill the container too full: leave some breathing space at the top of the container for the ecosystem to work; it also needs a “lid” that breathes such as a paper coffee filter, dish towel, or a piece of paper towel.</li>


    

<li>Food-grade plastic, glass, or stainless steel is okay, despite what online research may say</li>


</ul><h2>Brewing Sweet Tea</h2>




<ol><li>


<h3>Water</h3>




<ul><li>Must be chlorine-free, clean, potable</li>


    

<li>Avoid minerals – hard water can slow it down or kill it so if you’re using tap, boil it first and then let it sit overnight; then reboil it for tea</li>


</ul></li>


    

<li>


<h3>Sugar</h3>




<ul><li>1 cup sugar per 4L / 1 gallon of tea / kombucha. Don’t worry, 50-80% of the sugar gets converted</li>


    

<li>White is good; evaporated cane juice crystals is the best choice. A bag of Kirkland organic cane sugar is supposedly only $4!</li>


    

<li>If you decided to use honey, he recommends that you get the pasteurized kind because the raw, unpasteurized kind contains anti-bacterial properties, thus may kill it[ref]Jun, is a honey-based kombucha, and <a href="http://www.kombuchabrooklyn.com/blog/jun-honey-based-kombucha/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">using raw honey</a> seems to yield success[/ref]. Honey will result in a faster brew; same with maple syrup, so use less if you use either kind.</li>


    

<li>Do not use artificial or plant sugar (e.g. stevia, agave), as it won’t work</li>


</ul></li>


    

<li>


<h3>Tea</h3>




<ul><li>Black tea is the best; use bagged or loose</li>


    

<li>Avoid flavoured or herbal teas; any natural oils in them can kill the SCOBY (makes sense since some <a href="http://her.happyhippos.ca/2017/01/essential-oils-when-less-is-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">essential oils</a> have anti-fungal, anti-bacterial properties)</li>


    

<li>Should just stay “tea” in the ingredients; decaf is okay</li>


    

<li>Boil 4-5 bags of tea in a 2 gallon pot of water for 15+ minutes; cool it down to lower than body temperature before adding it to the starter brew</li>


</ul></li>


</ol><h2>Ready State</h2>




<ul><li>Is the kombucha ready to drink? You can use a straw (and a finger to suck up some tea) for the taste test, or more scientifically, you can also use PH strips to check for the ideal 3.5 PH; a PH of 4.0 is indicative of a new batch, <3.0 is more potent. For a 2 gallon batch, it will start stating like apple cider vinegar around Day 5, and generally, a batch would be ready in about 7-10 days. If you want to slow the process down, you can put the whole thing in the fridge. You can pour it out in a batch and leave some starter brew (batch brew), or add a new batch of freshly brewed tea to the container (continuous brew)</li>


    

<li>When it’s ready, you can do a secondary fermentation, where you add 10-20% of fruit or other flavours in a bottle of ready kombucha, such as ginger or pear, with or without pulp. Leave it in room temperature for 1-5 days. Sealed will make more carbonation (be careful when opening)</li>


    

<li>You can put it in the fridge to cool it before drinking, or you can drink it straight up.</li>


</ul><h2>Clean up</h2>


When washing the jars and other equipment for kombucha, don’t use antibacterial soap, including on your hand; you can easily use hot water and vinegar to wash and rinse.
ENJOY!]]>

In other news, Bean has self-designated herself as being a “baby” more often now, putting toys and teethers into her mouth (which she didn’t do), asking to be fed and held, crawling around (which she didn’t do), asked to be called her brother’s name and saying that the baby is the big sister, and mimicking baby coos.]]>

		<p>				The Power of a Praying Parent by Stormie Omartian (I keep thinking it’s “O’Martian”), and we just covered a chapter that talks about releasing our children to God, and this is an example of a very much an appropriate moment to follow her model of prayer: that if it’s in His will and in His time, that our son will outgrow both his allergies; but if not, will be managed well so that no one would ever need to use an epipen on him; but if so, that it is administered successfully and effectively.
I’m still processing the news, so I didn’t get a chance to think of and ask the many follow-up questions that have since popped up (stemming from online research and what others have shared with me – yep, I’m also one of those internet moms), but here are some questions that people have asked and the answers I have come across:
<strong>Q. Will he outgrow his allergy?
A. </strong><a href="http://aacijournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1710-1492-7-S1-S7#Sec12" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Possibly</a>. Our allergist says that many children outgrow their milk allergy by the age of 5. I just found out that my siblings and I all had milk allergies until we were 1 years old, and our mother experimented by trying to reintroduce milk slowly and over time. However, only 20% of kids outgrow their peanut allergy. Because Bean seemed to have a milder reaction to peanut butter when she was younger, but outgrew it by 2 years old – which surprised him, the allergist suggested paying for a blood test to see if her brother would qualify for reintroduction of peanuts under clinical supervision; we’re praying that he’d be eligible. So, as of now, it is what it is – will just have to adapt to manage it.
<strong>Q. How severe is his allergy?
A.</strong> At the skin prick test, the one for peanuts was about 5mm, and the one for milk was slightly larger (6mm, maybe?); I think <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15482519" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the size indicates a positive diagnosi</a>s, but I didn’t think to ask. According to one site, “<a href="http://www.kidswithfoodallergies.org/page/food-allergy-test-diagnosis-skin-prick-blood.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">no test […] can determine severity</a>“. Nevertheless, we’ve been advised to keep two epipens with him. While, I don’t know the criteria for what makes an allergy a risk for anaphylaxis, we have seen <a href="http://aacijournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1710-1492-7-S1-S6#Sec4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">symptoms matching the criteria in Table 3, section 2 (GI and skin symptoms)</a> and <a href="http://aacijournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1710-1492-7-S1-S6#Sec3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">in this table</a>.
The allergist prescribed two injectors (<a href="http://www.kidswithfoodallergies.org/page/newly-diagnosed.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">as does this site</a>), but I think most people I know only carry one. Although he does not meet <a href="http://aacijournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1710-1492-10-40" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the minimum recommended weight of 15 KG (33 LBs)</a>, the allergist still recommended that over a self-administered antidote citing that human / user error is very common. He then used an ultrasound machine to measure the thickness of muscle between the skin and the bone, to make sure that our son’s thighs is fat enough – more than 13mm – <a href="http://aacijournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1710-1492-10-40#Sec2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">so that the injection won’t hit bone</a> (and bone marrow, which is equivalent to a IV administration and that’s bad); he was 16mm. Another option is available (TwinJet?) but is supposedly the same dose.
<strong>Q. Is there no other option other than Epipen? What about Benadryl?</strong>
<strong>A. </strong>The allergist and online sources tells me that Benadryl won’t help with breathing, but it may help reduce other symptoms (e.g. puffy eyes, lips).
<strong>Q. What can he drink instead of milk, to get the fat content and other nutrients that is in whole milk?
A. </strong>My dietician and online sources say that breastmilk is best so to keep breastfeeding for as long as possible. As long as we have the go ahead to eat soy, we can also have soy and coconut milk; there’s rice and almond milk as well. I’ve tried hemp milk, and it tastes like grassy straw, which I’m not a fan of at all. Fortified alternatives provide at least 30% calcium and some fat content, but it doesn’t completely replace milk’s benefits; it’s also a shame that many companies use carrageenan (or xanthan gum, but not as bad) to thicken their drink, and add sea salt to flavour it. I have to remember to continue to supplement him with Vitamin D. For good fat, I will likely have to be more creative, using oils like avocado or olive, and serving more salmon (frozen filet steaks of wild Alaskan salmon is readily available from Kirkland / Costco year-round, works out to be 10$/lb which is reasonable)
<strong>Q. What about formula?
A. </strong>Online sources seem to suggest that if a baby has a milk allergy, baby may have a higher likelihood of developing a soy allergy, so switching to a soy based formula may end up increasing the risk.
<strong>Q. Can he have lactose-free, cheese, or yogurt? What about goat’s or sheep’s milk?
A. </strong>Unfortunately, the allergy is to the milk protein, not the lactose. Most people with milk allergy is to cow’s milk protein, but I’m not sure if we have the go-ahead to try other kinds of dairy.
I did mention that I had accidentally fed him vegetables cooked in butter a couple of times and failed to see a reaction, to which he was surprised, so as a result, he told me keep to doing it, but don’t go beyond what I normally would have done. We will likely have to monitor him very, very closely if we do that – not to mention, we’ll have to watch him even more closely when we aren’t the ones providing his meal / food. Though, I wonder if he can tolerate <a href="https://aacijournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1710-1492-8-5#Sec1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">extreme heated milk products</a> – will have to ask.
<strong>Q. Can he have other nuts?</strong>
A. In theory, yes. Peanuts is technically a legume and not a tree nut (e.g walnut, pecan), but we have to be careful of cross contamination because they may be processed in facility that isn’t peanut free.
<strong>Q. What about peanut oil?</strong>
<strong>A.</strong> I’m not sure about this one. Online sources say that pure unrefined peanut oil should be safe, but I need to check with the allergist about this one. Will likely have to avoid though, especially in commercial places, like restaurants – because can you be sure that it’s pure and unrefined?
<strong>Q. So, are you a peanut and dairy-free household now?</strong>
<strong>A.</strong> Thankfully, complete elimination measures aren’t necessary at this time. In fact, the allergist told us specifically not to stop giving our daughter peanut butter! However, <a href="http://www.hamiltonhealthsciences.ca/documents/Patient%20Education/CowMilkProteinAllergyWhatToEatBreastfeeding-trh.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mom will also need to follow a similar elimination diet</a>, which will be a challenge, as she can’t eat anything from the allium family either (e.g garlic, onions, chives, leeks).
<strong>Q.</strong> <strong>What can I do to help?</strong>
<strong>A.</strong> Pray for us – I (we) have no idea what I’m (we’re) doing. Trying to avoid garlic, onions, etc. is already hard; I’m also thinking that avoiding dairy will likely be more challenging than peanuts. And, if you eat with us, we especially appreciate that you take our dietary needs into consideration – understandably, it’s probably especially hard if you don’t need to conscientious of it in your everyday life; I’m sorry for the inconvenience. If you’re in a similar family situation, I’m open to hearing advice and your experiences too. Thank you!]]>		</p>

		<p>				<em>28 cups </em>of peppermint tea![ref]though I first read that it was up to 75 bags of peppermint tea![/ref]
In my journey as a mother, it has given me the perfect excuse to move from the mainstream to the more natural (and sometimes more trendy, hip, and thus, expensive) – away from synthetic dyes, strong-chemical cleaners, parfums and fragrances; now, instead of getting excited for $3 anti-bacterial hand soap from the Bath&Body Works, I get excited over $9 1.1L bottles of Dr. Bronner’s castile soap, which is pretty much an all-purpose cleaner (for body, face, hands, counters, floors and sinks!). And, I can use a few drops of essential oils to scent it to my fancy – plus, certain essential oils are said to contain active anti-bacterial, anti-fungal properties, which, if true, then bonus!


</p><h2>Beginning with Essential Oils</h2>


[caption id="" align="alignright" width="425"]<a title="anti-wrinkle-essential-oils" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/68909241@N07/8756694939/in/photolist-ekNmjX-qSGAAJ-8vEXkh-eaFRRJ-eRjdg1-a1XWoX-79m1GY-79ha7z-oAWCZN-shNHnE-e2GekE-e2Gerw-c6dPw1-c6dQzh-e2AA52-e2AAoH-e2AAbV-yxpQy-djhHry-5nM8nz-diH6ED-enR4oJ-du4hMD-c6dQ6J-jNEXte-mwJpD3-bvfeA8-oUfH18-cSWygw-8vBVVr-bvfeCT-ncFQvr-8vEXcj-cT8D2J-q9iSSx-aviHH7-boYt43-shNBso-qMDNKT-c6dNcA-7Tmt1Z-4vgg87-9YSyvh-6ADu3y-e7gX8o-q9zzAX-wEWXTH-q77UuW-npkeSc-PuyXy" data-flickr-embed="true"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/3/2852/8756694939_220ee70077.jpg" alt="Essential oils dropper" width="425" height="282"></a> These containers are best to dispense essential oils a drop at a time.

<script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
So where does one start? Had I known more about essential oils before buying my first few vials, I probably would’ve gotten a few less, or one or two different ones. But, with that being said, I ended up with lemon, citronella, sweet orange, rosemary, spearmint, lavender, ylang ylang (a later addition) and tea tree essential oils.
Now, I’d recommend one or two from each of these <a href="http://www.deancoleman.org/commonoils.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">three categories</a>, especially if you tend to enjoy experimenting and like to use your own blends instead of an essential oil on its own:


<ul><li>A “base” (grounding) essential oil, such as frankincense, sandalwood, cedarwood – it looks like I’m missing this from my collection; I had a broken bottle of frankincense which was lovely while it lasted (during the 1 use).</li>


    

<li>A “middle” essential oil, such as lavender or rosemary – personally, I find lavender to be more versatile than rosemary[ref]especially since rosemary is not recommended for use around younger children from various sources online.[/ref]</li>


    

<li>A “top” essential oil, such as sweet orange, lemon, grapefruit, peppermint/spearmint, eucalyptus – the citrus ones are great in cleaning agents, soaps, but use caution in diffusers as they can erode plastic and as they can affect your skin in sunlight / cause a photosensitive reaction when applied topically [ref]Note that various sources online also recommend against using peppermint and eucalyptus essential oils around younger children.[/ref]</li>


</ul><h3>! Precautions and safety, especially around children and pregnant women</h3>


I’m still learning about essential oils so I’m far from being an expert in this, but as essential oils are known to actively affect our bodies (it’s not just nice-smelling), I would follow these precautions, especially around children and pregnant/nursing women:


<ul><li><strong>Don’t eat, don’t apply</strong>: Essential oils are the most potent when ingested and when applied directly on the body especially without any dilution (e.g. with a carrier oil), aka “neat”. I would avoid unless under direction and care from a health practitioner</li>


    

<li><strong>Rosemary, Eucalyptus, Peppermint</strong>: based on what I’ve read online, I would lean towards avoiding these three essential oils around younger children (sources explain that it might affect their breathing), and if you do use it, let it dissipate for 2 hours prior to exposing children in the same area. Though, I’m still wondering about the commercial products that are advertised as being baby safe that contain these ingredients in them, especially eucalyptus in chest and cold rubs, and germ blends for diffusion (maybe their effectiveness is counteracted by all the other ingredients??)! </li>


    

<li><strong>Pregnancy:</strong> Avoid the use of essential oils in your first trimester of pregnancy; <a href="https://www.westcoastaromatherapy.com/free-information/articles-archive/life-ppasssages/using-essential-oils-during-pregnancy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">research the safe ones</a> for the latter trimesters and nursing if using. Yes, I had exposure to essential oils in massage oils, foaming hand soap, and in commercially available shampoo and handmade (but not homemade) bar soap while I was pregnant and nursing.</li>


    

<li>Use the more common essential oils, unless you’ve researched the others</li>


    

<li>When in doubt, avoid or look it up online first</li>


    

<li><strong>use on body > in the air >  in cleaning products</strong>: essential oils have a shelf life, so once it starts to degrade, instead of using it say as a component of your massage oil, you can add it to your diffuser or into a cleaning agent (e.g the mop bucket) instead</li>


    

<li><strong>Less is more:</strong> unless you use a lot, buying a small vial (10ml instead of 15ml) will ensure freshness. Also, one drop goes a long way even when diluted, as your nose will likely tell you. When diffusing, don’t let the diffuser go for extended periods of time as you just end up wasting its effectiveness; I’ve read recommendations of 10 minutes at a time for up to 1-2 hours.</li>


</ul>


You can find more <a href="https://naha.org/?/explore-aromatherapy/safety" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">extensive lists of safety considerations</a> online.


<h2>What can I do with essential oils?</h2>


Now that you have a few bottles of essential oils, here are some ideas on what you can do with them:

		<p>				In general


These are two places I check first for flights and accommodations:


</p><ul><li>Google Flights – use them to get a sense of what the prices are, and where you might be able to find the lowest price if you’re more flexible with dates
[caption id="attachment_5515" align="alignnone" width="294"]<a href="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/flights.png"><img class="wp-image-5515 size-medium" src="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/flights-294x300.png" alt="Google Flights Flexible Date Chart to find the best price" width="294" height="300" srcset="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/flights-294x300.png 294w,https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/flights.png 699w" sizes="(max-width: 294px) 100vw, 294px"></a> To find the price graph or chart, you need to click on the calendar icon in either date field.[/caption]</li>


    

<li>AirBnb</li>


</ul>


If you’re flexible on time and destination, you can find some pretty great flight deals on <a href="http://forums.redflagdeals.com/hot-deals-f9/?c=5159" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RedFlagDeals</a> or <a href="http://www.yyzdeals.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YYZ Deals</a> / <a href="http://www.yvrdeals.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YVR Deals</a> (or other Canadian destinations via the parent company, <a href="http://www.ydeals.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YDeals</a>)
For ideas of what to do or eat, I like to sign out books from the library or borrow e-books from the library and jot down common suggestions or interesting ideas and go from there.


<h2>Within Canada</h2>




<h3>Flights</h3>




<ul><li>Pick smaller airports if they’re similar in distance to your destination and price (e.g. Abbotsford over Vancouver, Kitchener-Waterloo vs. Toronto) as you’ll likely find cheaper parking, shorter check-in and security lines, and friendlier people</li>


    

<li>Cheaper seats tend to occur between Tuesday and Thursday</li>


    

<li>Check for the prices of flights operated by smaller brands like <a href="http://gonewleaf.ca" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NewLeaf </a>or <a href="http://flyporter.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Porter</a>, and even the sub-brands of major carriers like Air Canada Rouge or Air Canada Jazz. There are charters too like Air Transat or Sunwing, but I generally avoid them due to size and luggage restrictions.</li>


</ul><h3>Car Rentals</h3>




<ul><li>Costco Travel Canada, for Costco members; free second driver if spouse is also a Costco member</li>


    

<li>Priceline – I haven’t used them, but my parents have been able to rent a car near the Toronto airport for $10 a day by bidding on a car rental once upon a time.</li>


</ul><h3>Accommodations</h3>




<ul><li>I find there are less listings in Canada on Airbnb.com (likely because it started in SF, CA, so you might find more choices out West vs East), but one good alternative are bed & breakfasts on <a href="https://www.bbcanada.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bbcanada.com</a></li>


    

<li>If you’re travelling to a university town, you can always check their conference center or student residences if it’s during a quiet time of the year (e.g. summer) for private suites, student apartments, etc.</li>


</ul><h2>Canada to/from US</h2>




<h3>Flights</h3>




<ul><li>Fly from a US city instead of Canada, if it’s within driving distance; one night’s sleep and fly package at a hotel (where parking is included when you’re away) is cheaper than cost of difference in flight</li>


    

<li>Compared to Canada, there seems to be more competition and options in the US: while there are major US-international airlines (United, American Airlines, Delta), we actually prefer the service and price of domestic-only carriers like JetBlue or Southwest; we have not flown ultra-budget airline, Spirit yet, but seat-sale prices are good, even with the price of one checked baggage ($21 per person).</li>


    

<li>Honorable/historic mention: Hipmunk.com, once a SF startup, which provides a more comprehensive view of travel duration, prices on discount sites like Expedia, Travelocity, etc., but to be honest, I don’t consult it as much anymore now that Google Flight is an option.</li>


</ul><h3>Accommodations</h3>




<ul><li><a href="http://www.airbnb.ca/c/ewong61" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Airbnb</a> (referral link – $40CAD for first booking)</li>


    

<li>Priceline – many people have booked via priceline, but if you’re travelling with more than 2, please note that the fine print says that the price is for two, so I’m not sure how it works if you plan to travel with more (do you pay the difference? I haven’t ever tried)</li>


    

<li><a href="https://www.vrbo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VRBO</a> and <a href="https://www.homeaway.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HomeAway</a> – so I’m still not clear about the difference between these two sites as they belong to the same company, and they seem to operate similarly to AirBnB but it seems less organized. My sister has booked with them before, for our places in Hawaii.</li>


</ul><h3>Car rental</h3>


<a href="https://www.autoslash.com/blog-and-tips/posts/all-about-additional-driver-fees" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Note that certain states cover a second driver for free</a>, and some car rental companies will have free second drivers if they’re your spouse or if you are a member, for example.


<ul><li>Costco Travel may have different prices on the US site vs. the Canadian site – and you need to have separate logins as well; free second driver if spouse is also a Costco member</li>


    

<li><a href="http://autoslash.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Autoslash</a>: we came across this site from Parents magazine – if you can’t find a good deal on their site, if you book via another site (like Costco) and send them the confirmation number, it will look for cheaper options until your trip starts. If you end up booking through them, they will automatically cancel and book the same reservation for you if the price drops before your rental starts! I couldn’t figure out their revenue model so it seemed too good to be true at first, but it worked out great. We found out the hard way that some companies don’t include fees in the car rental quotes, but this site breaks everything down for you so it’s WYSIWYG (or pay in this case). You don’t actually pay until you get to the car rental counter! If you are looking for a specific service, eg. a shuttle to/from the cruise port, you might need to enter a specific location code, which can be found in the car rental fine print when you search for an itinerary OR you can email them to ask which location offers it (they do seem to know!)</li>


</ul>


So, that’s what we have used in the past – if you have any links to add to the list / share, please leave a comment!]]>

		<p>				before and after the cruise and <a href="http://her.happyhippos.ca/2016/12/western-caribbean-norwegian-getaway/">the cruise ship experience itself</a>. Finally, this  one covers what we did on port days at Roatan, Harvest Caye, Costa Maya, and Cozumel.
The itinerary and cost are usually the two most important factors when we select a ship to sail on, specifically the days at sea to port days ratio, and the destinations. We had originally selected a sailing that included a stop in Belize (City), but when I found out NCL’s brand new private island was opening a couple weeks’ later, it seemed worthwhile to pay a little more to check it out. In the end, we still paid less because our cruise agent checked before our final payment, and the prices had gone down so she relayed the savings to us![ref]My mom recalls this happening before and since we were very happy with our previous cruise agent, who she has since retired, we just continued using someone from Expedia CruiseShip Centers anyway[/ref].  Ironically enough, after reading post after post that warned visitors about going beyond the port gates at Belize City and thinking Harvest Caye was definitely a safer and more developed alternative, we actually enjoyed Harvest Caye the least. We probably would have enjoyed the adventure in Belize City, as authenticity and culture was lacking at Harvest Caye.


</p><h2>Roatan, Honduras</h2>


This was our second-favourite stop.
In Roatan, we booked a private tour in an AC passenger van with Victor Bodden tours, as we needed the flexibility with two young children who got hungry (and ate slowly) at regular mealtimes and napped in the afternoon. But, the original plan was to meet up with the lady from Familias Saludables to drop off a box of donated goods – since we were in the area, I had wanted to do something instead of just bask in cruise luxury.  So, they were the perfect home for formula samples that I had and collected from freecycle, and since we missed Operation Christmas Child this year, it was nice to be able to pack a big box!). In my mind, I had thought that their organization was close to the port, so when I didn’t see the lady outside of the port gates, and their phone number wasn’t working, I was at a loss. Random tour operators hawking outside the gate would try to be helpful by calling the number, and asking me who I was looking for. Alarm bells went off when one of them, was like, “Oh! lady Valerie? Come here, I can show you to her building”. Yes, I admit, I started to follow him and left husband and daughter to wait but then politely thanked him when he pointed me to the building and turned around – because <em>stranger danger. </em>During this time, I find out that a member of the polizia tried to hawk a (pirated?) movie to j.w: “want a movie for five dollars?” Eventually, we went back inside the port and found the Victor Bodden kiosk.
Thankfully, the lady knew my itinerary and called them to say that she couldn’t make it, but I think forgot to tell them where to find their building. Victor had told her that we’d find them, so after going to a few spots (one being the address listed on their website and definitely not the first building that guy pointed to), our guide and driver finally found them with success! Turns out, their contact information is wrong on the website. The assistant told me that Valerie had a patient emergency and while I wished I could have stayed to chat a bit, the kids were in the car, so off we went on our tour.


<h3>Iguana</h3>


[caption id="attachment_5493" align="alignright" width="300"]<img width="300" height="225" class="size-medium wp-image-5493" alt="iguana stew" src="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/iguana-300x225.jpg" srcset="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/iguana-300x225.jpg 300w,https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/iguana-768x576.jpg 768w,https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/iguana-1024x768.jpg 1024w,https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/iguana-1568x1176.jpg 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"> You’re looking at a part of the iguana in the iguana stew[/caption]
Truth be  told, I didn’t expect an independent tour English-speaking guide to jump in with our driver, as she spoke Spanish only. Reviews online suggested that the driver was the guide, so I felt pressured to up our tip, since Victor had advised me to give the tip to the guide, Gina (which he relayed to the guide when she asked him), as all the day’s fees would go to the driver. It was her second tour ever, so I’m not sure if that’s why we didn’t go to as many spots that I read about. When I asked her why only some tour operators were allowed to sell inside the port vs outside the port, she explained that the ones inside have some sort of arrangement (or license?); I forget the exact reason. They took us to a overlook to see a picturesque view, but it looked like every tour was there, and so were the vendors. By then, because of our later start in the morning, it was lunch so we asked her for a local restaurant recommendation. She suggested iguana. Sadly, it wasn’t quite the local restaurant we were expecting – we ate under zip lines and by caged monkeys and birds, and all the patrons were tourists. Surprisingly, the iguana stew (stewed in what tasted like coconut oil , served with beans and rice with plantain) was one of the highlights of the trip, despite it being a stop for tourists; it tastes like a cross between chicken and fish (bones), which when I think about it makes sense – tougher than fish, but boney because it’s a reptile. Later, the guide told us that men just go into the bush to hunt for them, and sites online suggest that they’re endangered because of this. j.w’s Google timeline tells me that we were at Jungle Top Adventures Zipline for our iguana meal – it all makes sense now – that’s why I remembered her saying something about “Randy’s restaurant” because one of the owner goes by that name.


<h3>Retail stops</h3>


After that, we made a quick stop at the cameo factory, because I was curious to see what it was about as it’s a cruise ship excursion stop and on the tour’s recommended list. One guy was in his shop etching designs onto a shell; the rest of it was just a retail shop. And there was no active tour, but as we were leaving, a bus pulled in and I overheard them say, “sit down and the presentation will start shortly”. Seemed like a typical Turkish rug+coffee, Chinese tea or jade, or Korean ginseng excursion stop.
We were then headed to a beach, but the kiddies fell asleep, so we opted to stop at the chocolate+coffee factory (Roatan Chocolate Factory) instead. Turns out, Roatan doesn’t have the best climate to grow coffee beans, so Honduras coffee is grown and roasted on the mainland.  Again, there was no active tour or demonstrations, but I ended up buying a bag of coffee ($2 cheaper than at the port – we checked beforehand) and 5 bars of chocolate.


<h3>Beach</h3>

For whatever reason, the driver and guide wanted us to stop at West Bay beach where it’s $10 per adult which includes a beach chair, wi-fi and use of restrooms. We much preferred a local (free) beach, but after some prompting we were going to head that way. Thankfully, there was some shade at the side of the road right across the street from the chocolate shop at the West End, and j.w asked, “what about here? is it okay to pull over and park here?” So, we set up our beach tent under some palm trees (note: it gets quite warm because of the greenhouse effect) and Bean and j.w spent some time playing in the very calm water with maybe one or two others around and no solicitors; it was lovely. 
We ended up back at the port an hour early, so we walked around and I took a chance and had a scoop of passion fruit gelato from a cart for $2US; it was refreshing. I’m kicking myself for not doing more research (I figured that’s what the guide is for) and asking for more photo stops, e.g. shipwreck or touch-and-go tour of the popular areas such as Sandy Bay, West Beach, Half Moon Bay, or at least tell me that’s where these are when we pass by them.


<h2>Harvest Caye, Belize</h2>


This was our least favourite stop.

I spent some time talking about Harvest Caye <a href="http://her.happyhippos.ca/2016/12/western-caribbean-norwegian-getaway/">in my previous post</a>, and all we did was spend some time at the kids’ splash pad area (despite knowing about recycled water) and used our $25 of our $50 free onboard credit to rent an open kayak to paddle around the lagoon. It was sunny and hot, and we actually managed to go around the lagoon in about 1/2 hour, with only j.w paddling (Bean sat in the middle, and I held the baby). Good thing we didn’t rent a $45 electric boat; although it had a canopy cover, we probably would’ve gone around in 10 minutes. Bean and j.w also went to play in the water on the beach, and I tried to take a seat on a beach chair, but I wasn’t thrilled with the number of wasp-bees around! No other place had that. We ended up going back on board to eat lunch as the restaurants there were not free.


<h2>Costa Maya, Mexico</h2>


[caption id="attachment_5481" align="alignright" width="300"]<img width="300" height="200" class="wp-image-5481 size-medium" src="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/tropicante-300x200.jpg" srcset="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/tropicante-300x200.jpg 300w,https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/tropicante-768x512.jpg 768w,https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/tropicante-1024x683.jpg 1024w,https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/tropicante-1568x1045.jpg 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"> Front row seats to the beach and water and solicitors at Tropicante[/caption]
Our favourite stop, which is telling because we got back on the ship with about 15 minutes to spare. Most of the day was spent relaxing under palm trees or in the water at beach in front of <a href="http://www.sandalsandskis.com/tropicante.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tropicante</a> at the Malecon in Mahahual  – debated between this one or Blue Kay from reviews online. Anyway, Tropicante had the most excellent instructions on how to get there without falling into the trap of getting on a shuttle bus ($3 vs yellow cabs past the port gate for $2 per person). After stepping outside the port gates, it was very quiet in contrast, so you sort of wonder if you’re going to the right place. Thankfully, the yellow cabs were within a short walk, and they got you right to Tropicante. I was a bit hesitant about booking this place because of the taxi ride over and about not bringing the car seats, but even with one car seat, we didn’t belt our child in (gasp, I know!) and ended up holding them in our car ride over in a 16-passenger van (taller seat backs so I felt a little(?) bit better) but on our way back, it was just a Matrix. Steve, the owner, was right though – it’s slow, one-lane, short drive to and from the port. While not a good enough excuse, I’m thankful nothing devastating happened; thank God for his grace and protection!
[caption id="attachment_5495" align="alignright" width="225"]<img width="225" height="300" class="size-medium wp-image-5495" alt="Tropicante" src="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/coconut-e1482388388957-225x300.jpg" srcset="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/coconut-e1482388388957-225x300.jpg 225w,https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/coconut-e1482388388957-768x1024.jpg 768w,https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/coconut-e1482388388957-1568x2091.jpg 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px"> Fresh coconut and guacamole[/caption]
We had reserved a few loungers under the shade, and while it was relatively quiet in the morning, more people came in the afternoon but not to the point where it felt crowded. The $6 guacamole was delicious without onions, and each $2 coconut was worth it (and cheapest around if you don’t count tip); for every order of coconut, they actually took a ladder to a tree and climbed it to chop down a coconut. Eventually, we discovered we could eat the flesh inside the coconut as well! mmmm.  I think we ordered 3 or 4 coconuts, especially after Bean almost drank an entire one to herself. Service was excellent, although we seemed to have missed the owner; he introduced himself to those at tables, who also happened to be older (and caucasian). The ladies restroom was also very clean; I felt bad tracking sand and dirt on the floor! j.w and Bean spent time in the water; little guy and I spent some time there, but stuck around the loungers more. j.w ventured past the boundary to look for fish while snorkeling, on the advice of the staff – no wonder he mentioned something about hope he doesn’t die out there.
We both tried a massage – j.w got a lady from the restaurant next door (didn’t realize they’re affiliated with restaurants until afterwards), and she told us it was $15 for half hour, and $25 for an hour. j.w didn’t tip figuring it all goes to her pocket, but when I went with Tropicante’s massage service, it was $20 for half an hour and $30 for an hour, plus an additional tip. It was nice to feel the open-air warm breeze, with sounds of the beach but the massage was a relaxation one, that was nothing in comparison to a RMT, plus it was a bit awkward to be face down with your top off.

The shops along the Malecon (strip between the shops and the beach) all seem the same after a while: restaurants and souvenir shops. And, it got really hot under the sun when we weren’t next to the ocean or under shade, so we only walked a little bit after our time at Tropicante. On the way back, in the port village, we stopped to watch a demonstration where 4 men climbed a tall pole and spun to come down. j.w climbed a fake Myan ruin tower and ended up getting a great view around him.


<h2>Cozumel, Mexico</h2>


<img width="739" height="416" class="alignnone wp-image-5502 size-large" alt="Cozumel" src="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/cozumel-1024x576.jpg" srcset="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/cozumel-1024x576.jpg 1024w,https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/cozumel-300x169.jpg 300w,https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/cozumel-768x432.jpg 768w,https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/cozumel-1568x882.jpg 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 739px) 100vw, 739px">Although we could’ve seen a Mayan ruin, I decided to use it as a walking around day, as the better ruins required you to take a ferry across and I didn’t know how the kids would be – flexibility was the key.
[caption id="attachment_5497" align="alignright" width="225"]<img width="225" height="300" class="wp-image-5497 size-medium" alt="Starbucks" src="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/starbucks-e1482389021847-225x300.jpg" srcset="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/starbucks-e1482389021847-225x300.jpg 225w,https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/starbucks-e1482389021847-768x1024.jpg 768w,https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/starbucks-e1482389021847-1568x2091.jpg 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px"> A Chocolate Mexicano and what looks to be my name…[/caption]
We walked a long way to the local farmer’s market, but was disappointed to find that the restaurants in there only accepted pesos and there wasn’t much in terms of shopping other than produce and raw fish and meat. Eventually, we just found a random Mexican place to eat lunch, but it was close to $30 US for a platter (and mosquito bites) that we shared and a glass of horchada ($8?); at least it tasted homemade. Cozumel was also where we were told that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebozo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">rebozos</a> were sold in Mexico city and Yucatán, and not in these parts of Mexico. The best and most surprising find was the drinks at the Starbucks. WHO KNEW. I had avoided visits to chain restaurants, but we had gone in to look at the menu, and I had come across a Chocolate Mexicano. After conversion of 19 pesos to 1 American dollar, I ordered a tall, iced version; it was a delicious $3 spiced (but not spicy) chocolate drink that wasn’t too sweet even though I didn’t order it half sweet like most Starbucks drinks.  So much so, that I came back for another cup – this time, I inquired about the price of a grande and venti, and after conversion, they came to the same price of $4! Yes, I got myself a venti. I debated between this and a mango passionfruit frappucino, but like the barista said, the frap is a sweet blended drink (ie. smoothie), so I don’t regret it, especially knowing that they didn’t sell the mix in a powder form (my mom inquired on my behalf when they went on the same cruise 2 weeks later). Actually, even the espresso based drinks come out to be cheaper than Canadian prices after conversion!
We originally had planned to stop at MEGA, the supermarket that you could see from the ship because we often find unique food items at local grocery stores. But after encountering the places that only took pesos, j.w decided he didn’t want to walk there only to find out they didn’t take US or credit card. Turns out, this port and supermarket is the crew’s choice to get off the ship for snacks and chocolate and yes, they do take American dollars! Too bad.


<hr>
And this brings us to the end of another family trip, and first cruise and birthday for the little guy, and the end of three months of having j.w off on parental leave with us. Already looking forward to the vacation days he has to take before the end of next month. :)]]>

Of the five or so cruises I’ve been on, this would probably be the first one where I didn’t feel any sea sickness; I did feel like I was still rocking on land at times, but no noticeable discomfort while at sea – hurray! Sadly, j.w had stomach discomfort for most of the cruise, but he ploughed through it, and still did stuff with the family regardless. Because we were travelling to areas that have reports of Zika, the cruise line offered DEET-based mosquito repellent at no charge at guest services, which was a nice gesture.
One pet peeve: why are there misspellings everywhere on board? I realize that the majority of service employees on the ship may not have English as their first language, but Norwegian Cruise Line is a company with headquarters in Miami, so English should be its first language and typos just detract from a professional ethos. The marketing and brand correspondence should reflect positively on your company, including correspondence from companies that partner with you;  that is, Park West Gallery, the art auction company on board can’t even spell <a href="https://www.ncl.com/ca/en/harvest-caye" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Harvest Caye</a> correctly in their marketing flyers to the ship’s guests [their version? “Harvest Cay”]  – that’s the newest private island that NCL has branded and developed. Especially since we were only the second sailing to make a call there, you’d think NCL would want to make sure its name was spelled right. Speaking of which, we almost “bought” a  piece of art at the art auction; somehow they “recorded” j.w not lowering his hand in time (with the rest of the room, as everyone started out with their hands raised) and a piece was thus “sold” to us; we didn’t know until they sent us a letter to our stateroom that we had not paid the invoice. Other examples include menu descriptions that are cut off (e.g “garlic toas[someotherdescription]t”) and sentences in the daily newsletter (e.g. “you hard desires” [“your heart desires”?]).


</p><h2>Embarkation and disembarkation</h2>


If we thought waiting to board the ship was a long time, disembarkation and customs took over 1.5 hours. Some even complained on Cruise Critic and Facebook that it took them 4 hours. This is why I could never book a flight leaving on the same day we arrive; it’d be too stressful.
Embarkation took a lot time – we made it during our assigned chosen check-in time (actually, j.w and Bean did – the rest of us were assigned a later slot), but everyone was sitting in a waiting area in the terminal waiting to board the ship. By the time the first people were let through, people found out their staterooms weren’t ready yet so everyone mad rushed to get lunch – either at the buffet, Garden Cafe, or the sit down restaurants Taste / Savor.

Speaking of Cruise Critic, try getting in on the <a href="http://www.cruisecritic.com/rollcalls/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">roll call</a> – because that’s where I discovered that they had an exclusive Cruise Critic meet and greet where you get to meet and chat with the officers / management, so that you get their information if you need to escalate any issues. j.w mentioned to the hotel director that our room had a bump below the carpet (felt like a snake of wires), and when we later went to the room, a complimentary chocolate trio plate from the hotel director was waiting for us. Turns out it was sent via his assistant; the director didn’t actually know what was wrong with the room but he apologized that he couldn’t do anything more for the ship was full. They also served some light refreshments with complimentary drinks, including smoothies, but I found them to be very sweet.
Some on the  Cruise Critic roll call organized a cabin crawl, which was great because we got to see a studio cabin and its exclusive lounge (the hotel director seemed to have just picked a random cabin) – the mood lighting almost reminds me of a spacey dorm room  or a really spacious room on a plane – the toilet is literally a water closet; it looks like a space capsule and very claustrophobic. They have one-way windows that look out to the corridor, and you can opt to purchase a connecting cabin (and the $100 last minute prices for a studio cabin would make that very worthwhile). Other Cruise Critic guests offered their cabins for us to preview: a mini-suite is essentially a balcony cabin with a few more inches of room and a double sink, some of which have a tub shower instead of just a stand-up shower, and an accessible aft-balcony is almost 1.5x the size of a regular cabin, but I chatted with another guest at the meet and greet who was in a scooter and her accessible balcony cabin was likely two cabins in width!


<h2>Food</h2>




<h3>Main Dining Room(s): Tropicana / Savor / Taste</h3>


[caption id="attachment_5437" align="alignright" width="300"]<img class="wp-image-5437 size-medium" src="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/NCL_Dinning-300x216.jpg" width="300" height="216" srcset="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/NCL_Dinning-300x216.jpg 300w,https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/NCL_Dinning-768x554.jpg 768w,https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/NCL_Dinning-1024x738.jpg 1024w,https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/NCL_Dinning-1568x1130.jpg 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"> That’s because nobody spells “dining” like Norwegian[/caption]
Main Dining room food was mediocre at best. When you have a different dessert menu every night, but only one or two is repeated, and you find yourself ordering the same thing every night (i.e molten lava cake), then should have an idea just how ehhh the food is. I applaud them for allowing me to pre-order my meals ahead of time due to my allium intolerance as they prepped the dishes during the day, but that meant I was committed to eating at one of the main dining rooms the following night. However, ordering a plate of plain, grilled chicken breast or a steamed or broiled fish filet and a variety of steamed vegetables or even a plate of avocado, served to be quite the challenge – it seemed to boil down on who your server was and their pull in the kitchen (or whether they can inquire on your behalf) – this was very much unlike all the other cruise ships we had been on, and perhaps this is the huge drawback of freestyle dining; servers don’t remember your preferences and orders. I recall that the Maitre’D (Azim) and server on Celebrity went out of their way to ensure that Bean had  a great meal when she was still a baby on a restricted diet. I’m not sure whether my diet restrictions affected the end results, but vegetable pad thai isn’t supposed to taste like lo mein saturated in soy sauce – whatever happened to the low sodium request or the tamarind (or ketchup at the minimum!), and although the beef tenderloin in the beef wellington was nice and tender, I was expected a puff pastry around the meat, but nope, it was just a piece of meat and veggies. I ordered a tonnado carpaccio-like veal appetizer, and out comes a roma tomato salad, but the worse part is that the server thought that it was a tonnado dish, which tells me that they don’t even know what the dishes are supposed to look like!
We had made advance reservations, but we ended up doing walk-ins due to the (slow? lack of?) service at Taste; can we say it left a bad taste? (ha!). After trying all three, I think the dining experience is just the luck of the draw, based on which server you get. The atmosphere at Savour and Taste seemed similar, more casual but quiet, whereas Tropicana seemed more formal (dimmer lighting) but also louder with the nightly live-music entertainment on the dance floor, including some performances by Burn the Floor.


<h3><strong>Garden Café</strong></h3>


Maybe it’s because this ship is newer, but I really liked the added touch of washing basins / sinks at the entrances of the buffet; it’s easy to wash your and the kids’ hands without having to visit the restrooms.
A good variety of food was offered at the buffet, and made some attempts at some international food (I liked the Indian style curries more than the Chinese attempts, but possibly because I’m not Indian; the naan bread though seemed more like unleavened bread – the texture wasn’t quite there), and even offered a pot of self-serve chai tea (tasted like watered down evaporated milk with ginger tea than the spiced chai I usually encounter) at the buffet bar – it wasn’t with the rest of the beverages, so you had to have happened upon it, or someone told you. I really enjoyed the ox tail stew with plantains when we were at Harvest Caye for the day.
There was a team of very enthusiastic staff at Garden Cafe, who would often greet guests with a song or two at the entrances with one guitar in hand, accompanied by backup singers. On one occasion, they even stopped to sing little brother the birthday song on his birthday; what a treat!


<h3>O’Sheehan’s</h3>


The host didn’t know of chicken and waffles on O’Sheehan’s complimentary pub & grill (even though online descriptions mention it as a dining feature) and the breakfast I ate there was what I could get at the buffet – clever name though: Irish twist to “Ocean’s” which j.w  had to point out before I got it, so we didn’t go back.


<h3>Others</h3>


Shanghai’s only opened for dinner, didn’t allow for reservations or carry away/take-out orders, the tall tables weren’t toddler / baby friendly, and it always seemed full, so we didn’t get a chance to try their Asian-style dishes either. If food and dining service was a hit and miss, why would I pay a premium to try their specialty restaurants; that is, paying more for potentially equally mediocre experience? I did toy with the idea of getting my espresso coffee fix at the café/gelato/sweets and pastry shop, but the 18% service fee on a $2.95 cappuccino deterred me away.


<h2>Entertainment and Play</h2>


Norwegian Getaway is a relatively new big ship, at 2 years old. At Deck 7 and 8, you can take a selfie at a photo kiosk and send it to any email address for free, which is a neat way to say hi to people at home and a nice modern touch, since getting reliable wi-fi wasn’t the greatest unless you paid $7.95 for 15 minutes.
Despite it holding 4000+ passengers and crew, the play areas never felt full – but for a ship that size, central areas like the pools and theatre seemed quite small. While we didn’t end up having the chance to go down any waterslide, the lines for them and for the other activities including the ropes course, bungee trampoline, spider mountain (a net where you climb to slide down a loop slide), mini golf didn’t seem very long at any given point. All of these seemed to be targeted for younger cruisers (like their competitors – maybe knowing that’s where the money is these days), with the exception of mini-golf, where I can see my parents doing; the rest I can’t.
I didn’t think I would do the ropes course, but seeing that my fear-of-heights husband did it without much apprehension, I had to try it – plus, there’s a zip “line” at the end. The harness really makes it tame and very safe; it looks scarier to walk the 8ft plank than when you’re actually up there – I recall having some of these ropes on childhood play structures above the ground, and there were definitely no harnesses and people did get injured (though a friend tells me that she jumped and broke her leg, and not fall through the ropes). You do need closed toe and heel shoes (yes, even water shoes without socks), and a sleeved shirt – maybe so that the harness wouldn’t chaff against your shoulder?
Sadly, the climbing wall was only open for limited hours (usually during nap time or dinner time), and I didn’t end up trying it either. They require socks and dry clothing, but provide climbing shoes and helmet for you at the rock climbing wall (so you might wish to bring and wear a bandana).
Notes: the loop waterslide has a minimum rider weight of 99lbs – if you don’t meet that requirement and depending on what you wear, you might not make it around the loop and have to escape through the emergency hatch at the bottom of the loop; I didn’t even try to attempt. The sign for the bungee trampoline says that the maximum weight was 80lbs even though their marketing says it’s for kids and adults, so while I had wanted to try it, I didn’t. It wasn’t until after the cruise that when I searched online for photos of adults trying it (because what adult is 80lbs?! I may be close but still didn’t meet the requirement), that I saw people post photos of a previous cruise where they had a piece of paper taped over the 80lb correcting it to 160lb. That made more sense – as j.w said, I should’ve just asked them – though I didn’t want to embarrass myself in front of some kids so that’s probably why I held back anyway. 
I would also say that the private island, Harvest Caye, belongs under this category as I see it as an extension of NCL. Unlike the other ports, this island had a very artificial feel to it – with a “nature” center consisting of a few cages of animals, pristine sand, beach chairs crowding the beaches, a tiny lagoon for rented boats, stand up paddle board and kayaks, a pool with a swim-up bar, and potted plants. I felt bad for the lone staff manning a very empty ropes course – why would someone walk so far and pay for a ropes course when there’s a decently free one on board? The worst idea on that island though is probably recycling the water in the children’s splash pad / water park – we all know that some kids end up swallowing water when they play hard – especially down a waterslide, and other kids end up well, having accidents in the water when they play hard. You’d also think they would plan for having enough water on a hot day; the water level became too low for them to continue to operate the kid’s waterslide.


<h3>Kid-friendly activities</h3>

I was a little disappointed at the Guppies room (0-3yo free play), as it hardly had enough room for two families to supervise and play, and they didn’t have a toy lending program unlike the Celebrity Millennium, but I appreciated the structured time they had set out for 0-2 year olds with their caregivers; we unfortunately missed most of them though as it conflicted with our lunch or dinner times. While they had a great program for children 3 years and older at Splash Academy, including a final theatrical performance by the kids, Bean didn’t take to it so well and refused to stay / go after the second day. She really enjoyed the soft foam splash pad area though, and it was enclosed, which was a nice touch to keep the kids (and water) in.


<h3>Performances</h3>


To be honest, I didn’t understand <em>Burn the Floor</em> feature performance (just looked like a mish-mash / showing off of all ballroom dance genres) and the music from <em>Million Dollar Quartet</em> wasn’t my cup of tea, so when our kids seemed more tired than usual, we weren’t too disappointed to miss it even though we had reservations. And because of kid bedtime routines starts around 8:30 PM, we usually had to call it a curfew after that time – so we didn’t see the complimentary comedy shows or other events in the evenings either.
 
Overall, it seemed less pretentious that Royal Caribbean’s <a href="http://her.happyhippos.ca/2013/03/eastern-caribbean/">Allure of the Seas grandioso experience</a>, maybe being less pretentious outweighs the other not-so-positives. When researching prior to the cruise, forum posters talked about NCL’s change of policies such as restricting any liquids to be brought on board, but according to some conversations I had with service staff, it seems like they also made changes for their staff: with vacation requests extending beyond 2 months is more rare and evaluated according to seniority; it also seems the staff have less say in preference as to which ship to work on after each contract. Thus, more of their lives are spent on board than at home (often leaving family at home) and if they work well with a team or certain team members and are very familiar with one ship, they may have to relearn everything. Be warned that service staff may still be on shift / duty despite showing signs of a cold or a flu; I overheard the manager at the internet desk explaining that he was sick so he shouldn’t shake his co-worker’s hand. Sure enough, he was holding a wad of tissue and sadly, that was after I had already let my little one pound on the keys at the internet cafe. I made sure to wash his hands after, but maybe that’s where he caught the cold from, and didn’t get signs until the cool Miami evening breeze at the beach, thereby affecting everyone else in the family.

		<p>				Flights


When I booked our flights, I didn’t realize that we were flying on American Thanksgiving[ref]in my excitement, I had failed to realize that the Thanksgiving Christmas parade was taking place as we were landing, so it was on our schedule but we ended up missing seeing a winter holiday parade in warm weather[/ref], and had I waited to buy our tickets, we probably would’ve saved even more as a result of holiday seat sales. But, our cruise agent had given me a Canadian quote of $300 one-way from Toronto, so when it was $150 one-way from Buffalo, I jumped on it. Other than no waiting at customs, I am thrilled to discover that there is now a Trader Joe’s en route from the Buffalo area. Driving back was no-fun though as the one-year old cried non-stop from there to the QEW, when he finally fell asleep and consequently lost his voice for a couple of days (resulting in whimper cries and hoarseness).
Notes regarding flight carriers:


</p><ul><li><strong><img class="alignright" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3c/JetBlue_Airways_Logo.svg/585px-JetBlue_Airways_Logo.svg.png" alt="jetBlue logo" width="161" height="54">JetBlue</strong> reminds of WestJet, but with free wi-fi on board and really good snacks (blue potato terra chips); $20US for the first piece of check-in luggage but no weight limit for carry-on items!</li>


    

<li><strong><img class="alignright" src="https://wieck-swa-production.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/372f5abb7c68f0bca406f561e53098d8484774ed/preview-768x432.jpg" alt="Southwest logo" width="259" height="39">Southwest</strong> is great when you have family, as you board after the A group, before the B group – we would’ve been B15 even though I checked in right at the 24 hour mark, so you get to choose your own seats first and each seat is entitled to two complimentary check-in luggage (leaving us with a ton of free hands because we didn’t have to take as many carry-on luggage!); they have free TV that you can stream on your mobile device but no free wifi. Their snacks are also pretty decent (<a href="http://www.belvitabreakfast.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">belvita breakfast crackers</a>), but if you have a peanut allergy, you probably shouldn’t fly with them as they distribute peanuts.</li>


</ul><h2>Miami and its surrounding area</h2>


We’ve discovered that living in beach-friendly Florida isn’t cheap – accommodations, eating out and groceries are expensive! I intentionally chose accommodations near the beach so we could walk there (no need to pay for beach parking), and but even fresh fruit and vegetables and seafood wasn’t cheap; cheaper than dining out, but I was surprised how much cheaper we get our groceries at home. It is also the last time I order something without inquiring how much it is: a slice of key-lime pie at Big Pink was a whopping $10USD ($13 CAD); thankfully, it was delicious and not neon green[ref]I had wanted to try key-lime pie, since that’s one of Miami’s fame, in addition to stone crab and cuban sandwiches  – we got 1lb of cooked stone crab claws at Publix in Hollywood, probably saving at least $10 US+tip but they’re impossible to crack with teeth but found out that if you manage to break apart the claws, then you can push the sweet, juicy meat upwards and out[/ref]. I surprised myself that without any spices available for us to use, we were still able to make a pretty flavourful cream-sauce pasta with supermarket new england clam chowder, some brussels sprouts, accompanied with stone crab. US should really have Spanish as the official bilingual language; it was everywhere! In hindsight, I’m glad we didn’t end up staying in Little Havana (that was briefly considered when I was looking for places on airbnb) because <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/11/26/tears-havana-cheers-miami-news-fidel-castros-death-divides-nation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the party went to the streets</a> in the middle of the night when news broke that Castro had died.

We weren’t specifically looking for anything, so we didn’t need to fight with the crowd. Actually, finding parking was a breeze at 10AM, compared to when we left early afternoon – cars followed you when you exited the mall doors. Turns out that if you go shopping (at Aventura Mall, not sure if elsewhere) before noon on Black Friday, some stores have exclusive discounts, like an extra 20% off at the Disney Store. We ended up buying 6 pairs of toddler socks for $7 at Sears (for the toddler, baby, and myself to use since there was a free soft play area that the kids wanted to play in and the candy store sold one pair of sock for $3 behind the counter), and a $50 shopping spree at the GAP because j.w somehow managed to win a gift card at the Samsung booth after taking a 360 photo – just because he had a Samsung phone, hurray! That mall also had a really great train set going and an indoor koi pool pond so that non-shoppers had other options too.


<h2>Unexpected surprises</h2>


In addition to the $50 surprise from Samsung, we definitely encountered our share of mishaps / unexpected costs on our vacation – to the point where I thought that maybe it was a sign that we shouldn’t have gone:


<ul><li>Bean fell down the stairs and bruised and cut her lip and nose a couple of days before – thankfully nothing was broken</li>


    

<li>j.w lost his wallet (third time within a few weeks) a few days before we left; this time it contained his newly received IDs, our US credit card and $400 USD. We still don’t know where it went. Thankfully, he had a temporary paper driver’s license that was still valid and a couple of Canadian credit cards  – though the rental agencies didn’t even check for the expiry date on his old one</li>


    

<li>in my rush to get ready for bible study the morning we were to leave, I had used my wallet to pay for our check-in luggage and forgotten to take it with me. So, no IDs, no health cards, and no credit cards. Thankfully, the second bath of USD was in a separate envelope in my purse and not in my wallet! Guess I wasn’t going to drive.</li>


    

<li>When we checked out of our hotel in Buffalo, they told me that the credit card on file was declined! I had prepaid on the Expedia family and friends site, but the hotel had to charge me again. Turns out, Expedia uses their company credit card to handle bookings, so I had to take the time to call and complain while on vacation – and Expedia made the hotel refund the charges, despite it being <em>cheaper</em> than Expedia’s rates (I suspect it was the 7-day vs. 30-day sleep and fly package). The hotel (Days Hotel) told me later, that they would match any other deal so I just need to call them and ask next time. Also, do <em>not </em>use a + in your email address on Expedia’s friends and family site to book your reservation (eg. youremailaddress+travel@gmail.com) because while it will create an itinerary, you will never get a confirmation email and customer support will have no idea why their emails aren’t getting through to you. I suspect that the “+” is a “bad” character and does crazy things to their script / code.</li>


    

<li>At our first car rental (also booked through Expedia, but with our cruise agent from Expedia CruiseShip Centers), we were surprised to see a $32USD extra charge on top of the prepaid amount. Had I known, I wouldn’t have rented from them. She told us that regardless of who you book with, charges will be added. Yes and no – we booked our second rental with <a href="http://autoslash.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">autoslash.com</a> and the fees were included in the breakdown of expected costs, so there were no unpleasant surprises (just pleasant ones – like them automatically rebooking the same reservation at a lower price, or Alamo giving us a free upgrade to a SUV which was much roomier than a standard-sized car and then calling us after our rental to ask how our experience with them was – talk about good customer service!). *<strong>Update:</strong> Wow, Expedia – I’m impressed. Our cruise agent followed up after hearing about our issue and comp’ed the extra charges. I didn’t expect the latter, but I’m thankful that our cruise agent took the time to hear what happened and how it could’ve gone better. I hope that future customers will be aware of these extra charges, and ideally will find out what they are specific to that location prior to their trip.</li>


    

<li>Way too many places are closed for American Thanksgiving – finding a place to eat dinner that night was an interesting challenge</li>


    

<li>When we got back to Buffalo, after waiting for a while in the hotel shuttle area instead of the off-site parking shuttle area for our ride back to the hotel parking lot, we discovered to our dismay that our car battery had died and needed a jump-start, so our hunger needed to wait. Thankfully, I had snacks for the toddler and she held up! We ended up eating a light lunch followed by a light dinner (back-to-back) but on the way back, our littlest one cried all the way from Trader Joe’s to the QEW before finally falling asleep. As a result, he lost his voice and his cries the following days sounded like a weak whimper with hoarse chattering.</li>


</ul>


Overall, though, it was a good time away as a family, without needing to worry about cleaning the house, making food (except when we wanted to), doing laundry, or running errands. According to Fitbit, our vacation was indeed a time of rest; the average sleep went up just shy of 7 hours for the week, from about 6 hours or less before and after.
Since this entry started getting really long, even for me to read, I’ve decided to break it up into a few parts. The next two posts will cover the rest of the cruise and port experiences.]]>

The decision to visit during the summer, during peak travel period wasn’t on the table but we did have vague plans to visit sometime to meet my sister’s baby and for the rest of my family to meet ours. As it turned out, my aunt was getting remarried and invited everyone to their banquet reception and the timing worked, so we redeemed aeroplan points for one way, and bought tickets back after school started so the prices were much better[ref]thankfully, we didn’t have to modify travel plans as some extended family members had[/ref].  At the wedding is where I get a 3-minute lesson from a cousin on whiskey-tasting 101: taking a sip straight up, then sucking in one breath of air after a sip, and finally with 1 drop of ice in the shot before taking a sip – each one delivering a different profile / depth.
We all managed to get through the plane rides without too many tears. Bean sat in a car seat, which I much preferred her to be in than in a seat with just a lap belt; the height also allowed her to look out the window. She was happy to watch TV in silence (but no naps), and on the way back, we survived without having a seat back entertainment system – it also seems that the flight from YXX-Abbotsford is shorter by an hour! The baby was sure different from when Bean was his age – I couldn’t nurse him to sleep and keep him asleep; j.w had to help / intervene.

Warm sunny weather welcomed us at the start of our vacation, which made the trip to the Sea to Sky Summit very worthwhile, as it was warm and skies were clear so you could see the views without having to hike up the Chief (photo: that’s neither me nor Bean). We then visited (enriched and encouraged by) our friends in Woodinville, as we traditionally do every time we’re out there, and every time, we’re reluctant to leave.
Alas, the warm weather did not last, but held up enough so that when my dad’s car had a flat tire followed by a dead battery, I could take the baby out to the side of the road and wait  – though we discovered that more people stopped because they saw me and the baby than when it was just j.w alone. And we all got sick, to the point where Bean developed hives and passed it to her cousin, and where I coughed so much coughed so much that the whole campsite heard me moan (dying cow?) in my sleep. We chickened out on the first day we were to set up camp (as it was damp and soggy and wouldn’t have helped my cold), and ended up joining our friends for 2 nights instead of 3. As it happens, we don’t generally hang out with too many families with young kids especially not all at once, so it took some time to get used to every child calling “mama, mama” and not wonder if it was Bean.

Bean and her cousin had a blast together, despite some tears throughout. We ended up staying at their place for the duration of our trip, so that the cousins could spend extended time together, and because my mom didn’t want our sickly germs prior to their cruise trip two weeks later [ref]to the point where I think I only saw her 3 times during our entire 3 weeks there – she probably figured she’d see us upon the end of their cruise anyway[/ref]. We visited the PNE – I don’t think I’ve been there since high school (the year I entered in some art contest, where my friend, Marie won!- and I took honourable mention). Since it poured, we stayed covered in the farm / agriculture area, where the kids get to go through stations and collect a treat at the end. I discovered that Bean was either afraid or didn’t like the (plastic) fish in her bucket as she would bury it at the bottom or not want to touch anything touching it. A momma pig looked happy nursing her many piglets, which made me think of the bond between breastfeeding mothers and babies and how it seemingly universal it is (though I wonder if they get latch problems too).
Whether coincidentally or not, it seems that every time we visit my “home” church, major leadership changes happen: a pastor resigns or a new pastor comes on board; this time, they introduced a Chinese pastor  and another English pastor announced his leave. In spite of the news, we both felt refreshed, as we were actually able to sit and listen to two sermons in a row, in its entirety without being interrupted by a baby (in the nursery) or a toddler (with her cousin and/or my sister in the toddler program). Furthermore, it was a series on marriage; a rare sermon topic at our church, likely because our demographics is mainly students. I don’t remember what it was about, except that we don’t pray as a married couple enough – but I’m guilty of not spending enough time with God one-on-one, so that would be a good place to start. 
During our visit, j.w started 3 months of parental leave; I was elated[ref]While it would have been incredible had he chosen to taken all 37 weeks – after all, it’s not often that one gets such an opportunity – he only wanted to take one month of absence from work for family bonding. I get it – I’ve seen the how (terribly) mothers are treated when they come back to work after a year of maternity leave – to a new team, new leadership, into a new assigned role and (worse) desk, and being away for less time should prevent that from happening; he also fears knowledge loss.  However, we managed to negotiate it to three in exchange that I would watch Star Wars: the Force Awakens with him[/ref].  His parental leave began in the middle into our trip, and would end with another trip (sandwiching a road trip with friends midway).
Bebe turned 9 months while we were visiting:


</p><ul><li>this was the start of self-feeding / baby-led weaning; he pursed his lips and refused any pureed food; instead, he took to ribs and other chunky food</li>


    

<li>we found out that not all kiddie toilet seats are created equal, and had to order one from Amazon, where the curved seat prevented him from arching his back every time we put him on, which affected his bowel movements</li>


    

<li>bum shifting became a means for mobility</li>


</ul>
