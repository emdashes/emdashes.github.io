		<p>				completely (like, totally escaped my mind) neglected to study for 25% of the exam! (10% out of 40%)–it’s a good thing that my classmate came in 5 mins prior to the exam and said, “so, did you memorize the definitions?”. And, then it occured to me that we were to be tested on key terms in the course as well! *groan* I fired up a quick prayer and quickly scanned her notes and my course notes and prayed that I knew the terms. I dunno how well I did in that section, but I recognised and was vaguely familiar with them but at least God answered my prayer in choosing the question that I hope the prof would ask me to answer (essay portion). Well see how gracious my prof is in that section this time. I got brutally killed in the first midterm. 😐


</p><p>
Some good news for me:<br>
“<i>Will you let me have a clean copy of this journal to put in the Renison Library for future Engl376R journal writers? You’ve really done some lovely thinking about language here. Keep it up!</i>” (prof from Renison College–extension of UW)…wow, I’m honoured! Well, slightly embarrased too. I don’t particularly like showing off my work for future academic scrutiny–even tho’ it’s ironic since I post everything online anyhow. I find that Engl profs at Renison tend to be very good (note Engl, Chinese prof is horrid). The only 2 times I got an ‘A’s in any written work (essays, etc.) was from Renison :P. And, I look fwd to Renison classes in general even though they’re so far, I actually learn in those classes. Shame that I didn’t do that well in my final exam for this particular course. Disappointment to the prof I’m sure. Ah wellz. English grammar is shure doggone a challenge! 😛 My info design course? 83% … could’ve done better, but I’m happy since I learned a lot or at least had practice to do some stuff hands-on and piqued my interest in this area :).
</p>



<p>
Christmas is around the corner! Now, I can finally “consider” Christmas carols. I really get annoyed at them when I’m in no mood for Christmas or to think about celebrating His berfday!
</p>



<p>
Yaay, I came home after my exam tonight and was greeted with not 1, but 3 Christmas packages! Being the spoiler that I am, I opened them all in advance because well, I’m leaving soon anyhow… =}
</p>



<p>


</p><ol><li>A Christmas card from my “meimei”! Ah yea, remember that girl that I asked you to pray for earlier this term? Well, she’s re-dedicated her life to Christ, but the story hasn’t ended happily ever after yet, and there are still many more battles to face, so continue to pray for her :).</li>




<li>A package from Marcy: the latest MaryMary CD (haha, so my two things I wanted for Christmas has been fulfilled :P), some pix, and my gel ink refill for my Cross Ion pen(s).</li>




<li>JELLY BELLY jellybeans! hahah, that’s the only kind of jellybeans i eat and i buy them when i’m at Sweet Factory, when i decide to spoil myself. How <i>sweet</i>. I’m in awe over them, or maybe over the giver, because I totally didn’t expect anything from him. 🙂  Hrm. Who’s this mystery guy you say? Well, he’s Bonnie’s neighbour. But…he’s also my classmate from CS (gone through ups and downs all with him beginning from CS114). I just realised that I might not see him after tonight because I’m graduating next term *assuming all goes well*, and well, he’s going on co-op in Jan.</li>


</ol>


I feel bad for not getting anyone anything in return…but, um…*shrugs*, I hope ppl are understanding. Tha’s why my policy is if I give you a gift, don’t give one back because you feel obligated to because that just spoils the fun of giving 🙂




<p>
*Ahem*, If I move down Drew’s “society of blogs” over the holidays/weekend, that’s to be expected. Harhar =). I’m going to sauga/TO for the weekend and then home, and well, at home my screen on my laptop is permanently cracked and so i gotta fight to use 1 of the 2 other computers we have…so if I don’t see you before Christmas, have a relaxing one, and don’t forget to wish Jesus a happy belated berfday :P. And to those that will be on co-op term next term, hope you have a good term, and DO come back for my convo! 🙂 (sick, which means change is coming soon. i hate change. i need to do some change management on myself. haha).</p>

So, I’m supposed to be sleeping now, but I just <i>had</i> to post this, would any of <i>you</i> eat food that’s left behind from absolute strangers? I wouldn’t. And, I also thought that would disgust most others too, but apparently not. D.Lee seems to ENJOY finishing off ppl’s (emphasis: faces that he <b>doesn’t</b> know or have seen!) leftovers, especially the ones left on the tables at the SLC. First, it was the (fresh!?) Timbits, and now today, the pizza! *shudder*–who knows what type of salivic germs (poison) there are on the pieces of food…and to ingest it too! I hope you didn’t lose your appetite now…oh well, I’m still hungry  :).
</p>



<p>
Oh yeah, forgot to mention, Rudy and I got a free game of Daytona @ da Cove today! The machines froze, so D.Lee suggested to reset them and that’s what Rudy did, and there were 2 machines w 1 credit in ’em :). Haha, he believes in rammin’. Boy, I haven’t played Expert level in sooo long…and as expected, I lost (it was his 5th game of the day) :P.</p>

Recently, I’ve noticed some odd activity going on: people have been visiting this at 4 AM in the morning from MC2060 (twinkle lab) and from MacKenzie King building. I don’t even know who lives in res there.. :|? Seriously though, at 4 in the morning in the twinkle lab? Tho’ my house is likely still up at that time, I feel soo sorry for the poor soul who’s stuck there to do essays, or anything else for that matter. I remember that room…spent most of my year there in 3rd year :(, but I got to know Ben Cheung and his accounting friends from there a lot better that year, so that was a good thing :). Back then, the Polaris computers could “talk” to each other by sending “phone” requests. hehe. Other IPs of interest: pei.ams.ubc.ca (UBC campus), Grand River and Huron Perth Hospitals…</p>

Yaay! Elaine (thx E!–if you read this) kindly lent Dan the car today so that I could submit my camera for repairs at FS–no questions asked! Thank God that it decided to break prior to boxing day, as opposed to after, else I would’ve had to pay for all repairs and shipping. All the gal did at the Customer Service desk was to get me to sign and state what was wrong–that would be strange if they took back a fully functional camera and not even check if what I stated was correct. Boo, I’ll likely be w/o a digcam over Christmas this year (would’ve been first Christmas in ‘couver w it too!), so  I guess it would haveta be w the old-skool way: the APS cam. Actually, I heard that 35mm is better, so I might just go with my original (automatic point-n-shoot) camera. We’ll see where the warranty takes me :). Hopefully, it won’t break down any further after Christmas because by then, I’d be pretty skrewed.</p>

I <i>finally</i> saw Hairy Pots on DLP today–no line up; only about 10 ppl in theatre! But, in the process, I seem to have um, broken my digcam! 🙁 I think. The reader and writer is faulty; it has trouble reading and writing to ALL memory cards–sometimes it works, sometimes it displays “reading/writing error!”. Thankfully, i JUST found my receipt (after searching high and lo for it–it was neatly filed away in my folder from last year), and the warranty is about to expire on boxing day, so hopefully, I’ll be able to take it to FS soon and get them to look at it. But back to the movie, it was a nice break from studyin’ and well, because I have now read the books, I was less bored (well not to mention that last time, I saw the first 3 hr movie at 7 am in the morning). The movie ruined Dobby for me–I had imagined him to be more green and cuter…and I still don’t get why the characters and the school celebrate Christmas; that is just theologically wrong and very ajarring. Frist time at Galaxy Cinemas, and first time viewing it in DLP. The resolution was more crisp I guess, but at times, I could see right down to its pixels, and even tho movie lacked “film scratches/holes”, near the end, there was a millisecond glitch and the screen blanked…

Yaay, I also got to drive, even though it was only a Hyundai Elantra. Thanks, Daniel :). First guy I I’ve met that doesn’t like to drive! I didn’t drive there tho’ b/c I wasn’t sure if I should since I had a glass of wine I had at lunch–ah yea, lunch. Our supervisor treated us to East Side’s today as well.</p>

Hahah, now readers can be automatically notified when I update this page (and read the entry), all without ever having to open their browser. Too bad that not everyone has this nifty RSS/XML feature in their blogs. Because if they did, then Erica/Rumble/TankLau/J.Mo/Jazzy/Wongoz/eBri/D/Jedi-Master/and whomever else’s blog counters won’t be messed and register me 10 times in a day–all because I’m checking for updates! hehe. All one needs is either a small application (e.g. <a href="http://www.feedreader.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FeedReader</a>) or logged into certain sites to get notifications of updates with the flagged sites of your choice (it’s mainly used for news headlines, etc.). Above all, I am always notified now when comments trickle in as well without having to open my browser. Oh yeah, and I can spy (er, “stalk”?) on other ppl that use HaloScan for their comments too. Laziness at its best :). Oops, I almost forgot; my RSS link is at .

Ah yes, I had the mild case of déjà vu (Ottawa 2001) this weekend, so I went to WLU to study. Wow, the school is sooo nice. I  mean, it’s like my highschool! The architecture and structure is similar of Trent and Carleton U, and well, my high school (my hs has lotsa windows allowing for sunlight and reminds me of a mall, built in the early 90’s). Now I know why they call it, “The high school down the street”. Heh :P.

Anyhow, I bought my textbook for next term and saved tons! 🙂  Hurry, free shipping ends on the 16th! (Wow, I’m doing free advertisement for them. They should pay me. Heh.)
