		<p>				Finally, a post about Facebook; I’ve been resisting all these months because <a href="http://ebrian.blogspot.com/search?q=facebook" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">many</a> <a href="http://theunwise.blogspot.com/search?q=facebook" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">people</a> have already <a href="http://jedi-master.blogspot.com/search?q=facebook" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blogged</a> about it, but I think this warrants a posting.</p>




<p>Over the past few months, I’ve come to realize how transparent our lives are or can be, for it is so easy to leave cyber-footprints behind – even if you are careful. With social network sites like Facebook and the ever so powerful search engine Google, and with some research, one can easily piece together another’s life.</p>




<p>Take for example, the lives of people who you interview or who interview you. I’ve found blog entries or wall posts about individuals belonging to those two categories (and helps me formulate a second opinion of them), and I’m sure that people I don’t even know have found out about me online. People wonder why I like covering my tracks. I don’t. I selectively try, but as long as I have a presence online, I know I can’t hide. Maybe it is better to be transparent.</p>

Oddly enough, you asked me if I was going to marry mumbles, to which I was bewildered and replied that I haven’t seen him in months. You did something to my hair though  – pulled the top layer back while I was on my stomach propping my hands to my face, chatting. I guess your fashion sense extended to hair styling too. I didn’t the results in the mirror, but it felt like a good change because I could see clearly, without having strands of hair falling in front of my face. That is, until Taiko Osaki decided to remark that it looked like I got a combover. </p>

		<p>				<strong>Ye’s Sushi</strong><br> 583 King Street North<br> Waterloo, ON N2V 2E5<br> (519) 888-6066</p>




<p>To conclude this three-part series, we end with our thoughts at <strong>Ye’s Sushi – Waterloo</strong> (King Street and Northfield Drive).</p>




<h4>What are your impressions of Ye’s Sushi (Waterloo)?</h4>




<p><em>Tim:</em> Ye’s feels like any other restaurant out there, without much of a Japanese feel.</p>




<p><em>Deanna:</em> This place has a very roomy, bright open feeling to the restaurant. Decor was very contemporary and up-to-date. The ambience of the restaurant at lunch almost borders on a cafeteria-like style, and the price is reasonable.</p>




<p><em>Stephanie:</em> And the interior is very nice with many windows. The layout is very spacious, with a lot of room to easily accommodate a large group.</p>




<h4>What dishes stand out for you?</h4>




<p><em>Stephanie:</em> Everyone in our party had the all you-can-eat lunch ($13). What impressed me was the selection of food choices – favourite was the dynamite rolls.</p>




<p><em>Emily:</em> I looked at their a-la-carte menu, but it seems like it is a better deal just to order the all-you-can-eat (since 1 roll starts at $5); plus, you can finish your meal with green tea ice cream. I almost always order their 8 piece rolls (king roll, rainbow roll, dragon roll), which generally seem to be their specialty. There was this one roll we had that I really liked (similar to a California roll but with fish roe, crispy pieces, and salmon), but when we inquired what it was called, the servers didn’t know and just said that it was a dynamite roll.</p>




<p><em>Tim:</em> I like the menu. There are lots of different dishes to choose from but the servings are quite big so you can’t really try everything that you want, unless you come with a big group (or hungry appetites!). Presentation is exceptional. The dishes served actually look like the pictures on the menu.</p>




<p><em>Deanna:</em> The crispy rolls, rainbow rolls and the mango ice cream stand out. The food was fresh and was presented quickly on cute Japanese dishes.</p>




<p><em>Stephanie:</em> Seeing the sushi come on porcelain plates rather than the traditional wood trays was a nicely added touch.</p>




<p><em>Tim:</em> The food was very tasty, especially the dragon rolls. The California rolls however were not good at all; they were possibly the poorest tasting California rolls that I have ever eaten in my life. The California rolls were cut much bigger than expected. I also thought the inclusion of the spoon with the miso soup was a bit awkward (miso soup usually doesn’t come with a spoon).</p>




<h4>Would you recommend this place?</h4>




<p><em>Deanna:</em> The service was fast and efficient and businesslike. Not too much chitchat between my group and the servers. You place your food order on paper and hand it to the server. We went at lunch time (party of 11) and there were a lot of servers. Dishes were plunked down quickly and picked up just as quickly. Felt a bit too interruptive at times, but perhaps it was because I was sitting at the end of the table and this seemed to be where the server put most of the food that our table ordered. The people sitting on the end of the table had to pass all of the dishes down to others.</p>




<p><em>Emily:</em> They also gave us a roll we did not order and insisted that the unagi (eel) was crab, but they did end up taking it back.</p>




<p>I do not particularly like all-you-can-eat sushi places as I find that you sacrifice quality for quantity. While Yummyaki’s (Northfield Drive and Davenport Road) is still my preferred choice for all-you-can-eat sushi rolls in Waterloo, I find that Ye’s has a greater selection of menu items.</p>




<p><em>Stephanie:</em> The wait staff were quick to bring our food and clear the plates, but I had a really hard time trying to make a reservation because of a slight language barrier. I found the sign by the tip jar stating a tip of 10% a bit rude, but other than that everyone was polite.</p>




<p><em>Tim:</em> On their grand opening day, the service was not very good. It took my party of 4, 45minutes before our names even got to onto the waiting list. Staff continually ignored us. A bunch of stuff that we had ordered never came. The food we did actually receive did come quite quickly. I would go there again and recommend it to others in this area because I had a terrible experience with Yummyaki’s; Ye’s seems to be the other all-you-can-eat sushi alternative in Waterloo.</p>




<p><em>Stephanie:</em> I would definitely come back again. If you want to try out different types of sushi, it’s a good place to come with a group of people for all-you-can-eat. Just be wary and only order what you can eat because you are charged $1 for every piece you leave behind.</p>

		<p>				Van Halen (RIM Rocks) concert that night) but by the time I got to work, it looked like I had forgotten it at home.
After work, I went home looking for it but it was not to be found: not in my car, not at work, not at my house. I concluded that I probably dropped it like <a href="http://bzchan.blogspot.com/2007/08/wedding-pictures.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bzhchan</a>; thinking whether it was worth that $10 gift card to lose a $200 camera. I prayed for a miracle.
My friend called the bank yesterday on my behalf, but it didn’t seem to hopeful. I called this morning and they said that they would call me if they saw anything, but they didn’t. Well, I thought to try and go into the branch anyway because j.w gave me a brilliant idea to ask to review the tapes to see if my camera was even in my purse when I took out my wallet. I looked at the walls and they only seem to have a camera at the entrance of the bank, not at the tellers.
I went to see the service desk anyway, and the lady said, you know what, a lady called…and I anxiously interrupted saying yes, I had called today. To my surprise, she continued and said a lady called to say that someone had put a camera (plus case) on her car when she came out from the gym (I guess in the same plaza). She didn’t know whose it was so she called TD to report it.
Wow. Sometimes, I think that if I was in a larger city, the chances of me recovering a camera in this situation is slim to nothing – the camera went through two strangers, who could’ve easily just taken it; the card was freshly formatted last night, the camera is new (within 1 month) and there was no ID – it would’ve been an easy finders keepers. Do I ever appreciate what this lady did; I am to meet her daughter tomorrow at another TD to pick it up and thank her in person.

		<p>				I have come to dread calendar invites. Calendar invites these days simply mean more meetings. When the bulk of my work day is attending meetings, it’s no wonder I don’t feel like I’m being productive.</p>




<p>Imagine my surprise when a meeting invite came today, not from the usual project managers, but from a group I occasionally work with (and have not met); it was to a celebration lunch at the team lead’s home. I took a look at the small list of the invitees to see that while I was only an “optional” attendee, it really made my day to see that another business unit extended the invitation to someone who really is only involved at the end of the process.</p>




<p>Sometimes, the littlest things in life count.</p>

		<p>				<b>Sakura Island</b><br>
255 King N<br>
Waterloo, ON N2J 4V2<br>
(519) 886-1812
</p>




<p>We continue this three-part series with <strong>Sakura</strong>
<strong>Island</strong> (King Street and University Avenue).
Stephanie recommended this place for us to try and even though she
could not join us for lunch the day we went for this review, she
shares her experiences with us as well.</p>




<h4>What are your impressions of Sakura Island?</h4>




<p><i>Simon:</i> Upon entering the location, I found that the place
was very neat and traditional. Dim lights suggested a relaxed area
for enjoyment purposes. The interior was elegant but the giant
portable air conditioning unit in the front entrance somewhat
changed my opinion of it.</p>




<p><i>Deanna:</i> The decor is nice and the ambience is inviting.
In 5 seconds we were greeted with a prompt hello and the greeter
proceeded to tell my group that the chef was sick and most items on
the menu would not be available. Not so good for my first visit,
but I was willing to overlook this.</p>




<p><i>Stephanie:</i> I love the new look of Sakura Island. They’ve
renovated and the new interior is much more elegant. The booths now
look much more solid and the rock wall is a nice feature.</p>




<h4>What dishes stand out for you?</h4>




<p><i>Stephanie:</i> I’ve been to Sakura Island several times and
each time I’ve been very pleased with the food. The spicy tuna
rolls are a favourite of mine; but be careful, they do pack a
punch.</p>




<p>During my last visit, I had a chicken teriyaki bento box. The
bento box special came with salad and soup, teriyaki chicken with a
generous portion of sauce, rice, and some sushi rolls, which is a
lot for lunch but it is also very good.</p>




<p><i>Simon:</i> Because the head chief didn’t show up for
work the day of our visit, only sushi was available. Thus, out of
the colorful menu, we only had a variety of three different
selections. This was rather disappointing, but if this was a one
time thing, I could bear with it.</p>




<p><i>Deanna:</i> Emily and Simon each ordered a nigiri (sushi on
rice)/maki combo ($12) and I chose the maki (sushi rolls) combo
($12). The food was well presented and fresh and tasty and each
combo came with a salad, making the size of the meal quite
generous.</p>




<p><i>Simon:</i> The food was great! Although the portions were
small and the service was draggingly slow, the food was very tasty
and absolutely fresh. The sashimi was fresh and had no indication
of being over-frozen. The maki roles were small, but the seaweed
was crisp and enjoyable. Each piece of sushi, although small, fit
perfectly in my mouth, and had the perfect proportion of rice,
fish, and wasabi.</p>




<p><i>Stephanie:</i> The sushi definitely seems nice and fresh; the
rice stays together, and the wasabi was good and hot.</p>




<p><i>Emily:</i> Plus, the salad that came with the sushi/maki
combo did not have the creamy, Thousand Island dressing that many
other places use for their Japanese-style salads. The sushi
actually had wasabi in the rice, and the wasabi was a nice, fresh
green color (sometimes I wonder about the brownish wasabi that
other places serve).</p>




<h4>Would you recommend this place?</h4>




<p><i>Simon:</i> Service was slow, friendly but slow.</p>




<p><i>Stephanie:</i> When I went last time for lunch, they only had
one waitress for the whole place and she was running around from
table to table trying to keep up. But overall, we were still done
in a timely manner. On one of my dinner visits, there seemed to be
enough wait staff and the chef even gave the table some free
sashimi to sample.</p>




<p><i>Deanna:</i> And once we placed our order from the three
choices on the menu, the food was prepared and presented quickly.
Despite the lack of menu choices due to the chef being sick, I am
willing to go back again when the restaurant has all menu items
available. There were quite a few menu items that interested me and
I would like to try the Korean menu.</p>




<p><i>Emily:</i> I remember coming here as a student and thinking
that the prices were much too pricey for what you get. I would want
to try the Korean dishes next time, like the rice cake soup
(<i>ddeok gook</i>) since I have a lot of trouble finding that
around here (the owners at Ichiban once told me
that it’s more a dish for their Lunar New Year).</p>




<p><i>Simon:</i> Great food, nice atmosphere, and good seating. If
you’re not feeling cheap, this place is a great place to
enjoy a conversation with someone. You get plenty of time while
waiting for your food, and you can enjoy the food ever so slowly. I
would come for a second visit someday.</p>




<p><i>Stephanie:</i> I would highly recommend this place to anyone.
So far it’s still my favourite place for sushi in the area.</p>




<p><b>Editor’s note:</b> Upon another visit, the server told us that do not offer the rice cake noodles anymore (and maybe some of the other items as well if my memory serves me correctly). If not, why do they even bother having it on the menu?</p>

		<p>				
I went to sleep with gum in my mouth and now there’s gum in my hair and when I got out of bed this morning I tripped on the skateboard and by mistake I dropped my sweater in the sink while the water was running and I could tell it was going to be a terrible, horrible, no good, very bad day. – Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible,
No Good, Very Bad Day





</p><p>Some of you might remember the story about <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_and_the_Terrible_Horrible_No_Good_Very_Bad_Day" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day</a></i>. If not, perhaps you have had times when you woke up on the wrong side of the bed. I know I did last week.</p>




<p>I woke up to what felt like any normal weekday and proceeded to cut the tags off my new pair of $6 pants (from <a href="http://www.aeropostale.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Aeropostale</a> – the only store that has pants that fit my height without the need to hem them and that are very reasonably priced). To my dismay, I then realized that I bought them a size too big (I had tried on a pair that were a different color in a smaller size, and I was looking for one size up in the jeans). At least I could remedy the situation by putting on a belt. As routine, I go out the door and into the garage where I had parked it (so it would be kept clean since I washed it the night before).</p>




<p>Stewie, the neighbour’s cat (that they always leave outside), shot from within the darkness once I opened the garage door. Apparently, he had camped in my garage overnight! My sparkling clean car now had some sort of powder all over the hood, along with paw prints all along the windows and top of the car. After I put my hockey equipment in the trunk for a game that night, I backed out of the garage but I thought I detected an odorous smell.</p>




<p>Turns out, Stewie took a big dump in my garage and I had the honours of shoveling it out. And, unfortunately for me, I had stepped in some: fresh, soggy, and smelly – a great combination for work (where we have poor ventilation). My shoes had grooves and of course, all of it was stuck in my grooves and a branch didn’t help wipe it off.</p>




<p>Thank God, <a href="http://www.meetz.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Meetz’</a> saves the day. They save your faulty lawnmower or snowblower by repairing them. For me? They saved my shoes. They were ever so generous in lending me their super duper power washer to blast my shoes (and the   dung) away so it was good as new 🙂</p>




<p>What a way to start the day.</p>

</p><h3>Update</h3>






<p>Last visit: August 20, 2010</p>




<p>Since this entry, it appears that the quality of the food has degraded with the same (high) prices. The portions are smaller, the noodles are soggier, and the teriyaki sauce seems to be thicker (corn-starch like). The charashi don/hwe dup bab is served with salmon end pieces and imitiation crab meat instead of the variety that I’m used to elsewhere. I’m sadly disappointed. However, they do advertise that they do not use MSG, which is a plus, and they do get busy especially on during lunchtime on a weekday. I don’t plan to return anytime soon though.

<h3>Original Review</h3>




<p>Waterloo has become quite a multi-cultural city, offering many dining options   from a variety of ethnic groups. Even though the authenticity of the foods are   at times questionable, some places are worth a second glance.</p>




<p>Over the next few weeks, a few friends will be joining in to share their dining experiences with you.   The lunch pick? Japanese cuisine.</p>




<p>I have noticed that most Japanese restaurants in   town are managed by either Korean or Chinese folks. This is true for <i>Tokyo   Ichiban</i> (Korean), <i>Sakura Island</i> (Korean), <i>Ye’s Waterloo</i> (Chinese), which range in size and specialty.</p>




<p>Let’s begin this three-part series with <strong>Tokyo Ichiban </strong>(Phillip Street and Albert Street).</p>




<h4>What are your impressions of Tokyo Ichiban?</h4>




<p><i>Deanna:</i> Tokyo Ichiban (affectionately   known as Ichiban) seems to cater more to the take-out crowd. So, it isn’t   surprising to see that many of its customers are from the surrounding   businesses.</p>




<p><i>Tim:</i> Ichiban is pretty small as it only   seats about 12 people, but I had a pretty good first impression. This place  reminded me a little of a restaurant that I like to go to when I am in   Vancouver.</p>




<p><i>Emily: </i>Many Korean-Japanese   restaurants tend to offer Korean dishes and Japanese food with a Korean twist;   and Ichiban fits the description. They also advertise that their food is MSG   free, which is always nice and they have some reasonably priced lunch specials.</p>




<h4>What dishes stand out for you?</h4>




<p><i>Tim:</i> I’ve ordered many different dishes,   including the bibimbop (I call it bimmybob even though I know for a fact that it   is wrong). I haven’t been disappointed yet – except for the California rolls; I   have yet to find a place in the KW area that serves a good California roll.</p>




<p><i>Deanna:</i> I almost always get the   vegetarian roll or smoked salmon roll. Both are quite good. The food is always   made fresh. I pre-order so that it is ready for pick up. The presentation is   very typical for take-out sushi. Eight pieces laid out in a take-out box.</p>




<p><i>Emily:</i> Although I would prefer less oil   in the hot dishes, I still like their spicy chicken yakisoba (stir-fried noodle   dish). While their rolls are on the slightly pricier side ($8 for 8 pieces), my   place of preference to get a spicy salmon roll is at Ichiban. The spicy salmon   roll actually has chunks of salmon in it along with avocado and other   ingredients with a spicy sauce like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gochujang">kochujang</a>; most other places   serves the roll with “processed” salmon bits with spicy mayo inside.</p>




<h4>Would you recommend this place?</h4>




<p><i>Tim</i>: The prices are a bit on the   expensive side but I personally think it is worth it because the service is   fantastic. I would definitely recommend this place to others. I enjoy the food   and the people there are very friendly. I do make a habit of going there at   least once a week. Ichiban is my personal favourite restaurant here in   Waterloo.</p>




<p><i>Deanna</i>: The service is always welcoming,   the prices are reasonable, and the food is always fresh and tasty. I order take   out from Ichiban approximately once every two weeks. They always know who I am   and I am always greeted with a smile and a hello. This has become my work   neighbourhood sushi place.</p>




<p><i>Emily: </i>I completely agree. <i>Ichiban</i> is Japanese for “best”; and Tokyo Ichiban does hold up to its   name; it is also one of my personal favourites for Korean-Japanese food in   Waterloo.</p>




<p><b>Editor’s note:</b> Since this review, Tokyo Ichiban is under new management/ownership. I do notice that they appear to leave certain ingredients out now from their take-out bibimbap, and the portion sizes seem to be smaller, but time will tell.</p>

		<p>				Okay, I admit it. I tend to have a tendency (redundant, yes) to skim over a passage in the Bible whenever I come across a story that is very familiar, or when I have a feeling of deja vu.</p>




<p>I sometimes wonder why the books of the Bible are not laid out chronologically, but then sometimes it makes sense (always in hindsight). Take the time when I read <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?book_id=9&chapter=31" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1 Samuel 31</a>, where Saul takes his life. A few days later, I think I am reading the exact same passage, almost word for word in a different book: <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?book_id=13&chapter=10" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1 Chronicles 10</a>. I was certain I read it somewhere and sometime ago, so I quickly flipped back to compare the two passages.</p>




<p>The author/narrator of 1 Chronicles decides to add an epilogue explaining why Saul died (not because of a battle wound as I was led to believe in 1 Samuel), but rather,</p>




<blockquote>
Saul died because he was unfaithful to the LORD; he did not keep the word of the LORD and even consulted a medium for guidance, and did not inquire of the LORD. So the LORD put him to death and turned the kingdom over to David son of Jesse. -1 Chronicles 10:13-14.
</blockquote>




<p>These are the gems for me, the “hidden” nuggets of truth contained in each story.</p>

		<p>				I can feel the stress of being a student again. At least when I was in high school, I had early  acceptance in February so I didn’t need to worry.</p>




<p>I found out that Seralt heard from UW the day after he sent in his application. What happened to my application?</p>




<p>Turns out (and after many transfers and phone calls mind you), I have been readmitted except somehow I was never notified. Thus, I have missed my enrollment appointment and all the classes that I want to enroll in are full.</p>




<p>I call the General Arts Advisor again and she suggested me to do the following:</p>




<ul><li>Sign up for other courses I am interested in (which by the way is 0 since I am only taking certain courses toward this diploma and the alternatives are not offered)</li>




<li>Get on the waiting list</li>




<li>Email the profs to see if they could sign me in</li>


</ul><p>*anger*. Maybe wanting to do this was not a good idea afterall.</p>
