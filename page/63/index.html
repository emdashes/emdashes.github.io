Well, after almost two months of waiting for Future Shop/Averatec for warranty repairs to my 3150H laptop, I must say that I’m generally quite happy with their level of service this time around. Although the lab technician at store 004 (Surrey) told me that they couldn’t ship it to Waterloo, the store manager offered to do that for me for free, which made my life a whole lot easier and stress free. Turns out, they just offered me a new, comparable laptop to replace my old one instead (perhaps because repairs + shipping would be more expensive). Thankfully they didn’t carry the 3150 anymore because according to the lab technician, he had seen some problems with them. What happened to mine was one of the coolant fans died so the cpu overheated and fried the motherboard.
</p>




<p>
So here are the “comparable” specs:

<p>
So, for having no extended warranty and for the price I paid for the first one, I scored a pretty good deal :). I called my brother to let him know since he used it last before it broke and the first thing he says is, “You should thank me!”.

		<p>				
After taking a 2-day training course on exceling in (customer) service, today’s incident at Timmy’s really made me laugh. Sip came bumped into me on my way downstairs, so I went with him to the Timmy’s at GTO.
The lady asks us what we’d like to order. When I said I wasn’t ordering, she responds by saying, “well, one of you must order” and she asked what Sip wanted on his bagel in one fast run-on sentence as if she was in a hurry or something. I looked around and noted that there was no one else in line, so I made a comment to Sip that she must be having a bad day.
While we were waiting for Sip’s bagel, we were just chattin’ and next thing I see from my peripheral vision is this lady waving the change in front of him. So, tell Sip, “Change” to alert him that she was getting impatient.
And what do you know, his bagel was burnt. The edges were completely black. I guess there was no use in going back to complain; she’d probably give him the entire thing black.

Hexley posted a very interesting excerpt from a book titled <i>Bad Boys</i> by Carol Lieberman and Lisa Collier, which says:</p>




<blockquote><i>
What is a bad boy? He’s a rebel without a cause, a cool dude in a motorcycle jacket, a real-life Huckleberry Finn who wants to take you on a wild river
ride to adventure. He’s wounded, moody, misunderstood-a dreamer, a seducer, a daredevil. He is a man of mystery and a fascinating paradox. He’s both a
lost little boy and a man with a dark side. He breaks your heart with his wicked ways, but whether he’s a wanton wolf or a dangerous desperado, he makes
you long to rescue him from his pain. He’s hurtful cruel, or simply careless and self absorbed, but you can’t resist jumping on his motorcycle and roaring
off into the steamy night with him. And once you’ve given him your heart forever… he’s gone with the wind! He is someone who sets off throbbing sexual and
aggressive passions within you. Because he’s aloof and elusive, you get caught up in the challenge and excitement of the chase-though he’s not always someone
you’d really want even if you did capture him. A bad boy may tell you he’s generally right. He’s a frog you hope to turn into a fairy-tale prince with the
magic of your kiss.</i>
</blockquote>




<p>
Reading this reminded me of an interesting conversation I had with a friend (she and I have a lot in common, though it may not initially seem like so) some time ago about how we will likely not settle down with whom we may be attracted to; her story for one is a living example. Hrm, definitely something to ponder upon.</p>




<p>
Going on that, I’d like to share with you a very amusing e-mail forward I received at work the other day (although I’m generally against e-mail forwards, this one is an exception): </p>




<blockquote>
How do you decide who to marry?


<ul><li>You got to find somebody who likes the same stuff. Like, if you like sports, she should like it that you like sports, and she should keep the chips and dip coming.- Alan, age 10</li>




<li>No person really decides before they grow up who they’re going to marry. God decides it all way before, and you get to find out later who you’re stuck with.- Kirsten, age 10</li>


</ul>


What is the right age to get married?


<ul><li>
Twenty-three is the best age because you know the person FOREVER by then.- Camille, age 10</li>




<li>No age is good to get married at. You got to be a fool to get married.- Freddie, age 6</li>


</ul>


How can a stranger tell if two people are married?


<ul><li>You might have to guess, based on whether they seem to be yelling at the same kids.- Derrick, age 8</li>


</ul>


What do you think your mom and dad have in common?


<ul><li>Both don’t want any more kids.- Lori, age 8</li>

</ul>


What do most people do on a date?


<ul><li>Dates are for having fun, and people should use them to get to know each other. Even boys have something to say if you listen long enough.- Lynnette, age 8</li>




<li>On the first date, they just tell each other lies and that usually gets them interested enough to go for a second date.- Martin, age 10</li>

</ul>


What would you do on a first date that was turning sour?


<ul><li>
I’d run home and play dead. The next day I would call all the newspapers and make sure they wrote about me in all the dead columns.- Craig, age 9</li>

</ul>


When is it okay to kiss someone?


<ul><li>When they’re rich.- Pam, age 7</li>




<li>The law says you have to be eighteen, so I wouldn’t want to mess with that.- Curt, age 7</li>




<li>The rule goes like this: If you kiss someone, then you should marry them and have kids with them. It’s the right thing to do.- Howard, age 8</li>


</ul>


Is it better to be single or married?


<ul><li>I don’t know which is better, but I’ll tell you one thing. I’m never going to have sex with my wife. I don’t want to be all grossed out.- Theodore, age 8</li>




<li>It’s better for girls to be single but not for boys. Boys need someone to clean up after them.- Anita, age 9</li>

</ul>


How would the world be different if people didn’t get married?


<ul><li>There sure would be a lot of kids to explain, wouldn’t there?- Kelvin, age 8</li>

</ul>


How would you make a marriage work?


<ul><li>Tell your wife that she looks pretty, even if she looks like a truck.- Ricky, age 10</li>

</ul></blockquote>




<p>Who knows, maybe this was all made up…</p>

Of all the articles I read every day at work, this writer and story is my pick of the month – lovely tongue-in-cheek humour that has a hint of truth subdued in the words:
</p>




<p>
<a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2004/10/26/ftberry26.xml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“Only the coolest get to pick this BlackBerry”</a><br>
The Daily Telegraph<br>

As of yesterday morning, I managed to secure a flight home at a reasonable cost. So, I’ve sacrificed getting a snowboard from my relatives in Ottawa for a week and a half home during Christmas – I am so looking forward to that for some odd reason; I want to snowboard!
</p>




<p>After being involved with the “shoebox ministry” as I’ve come to know it for over 5 years, j.w and I had the opportunity to be a volunteer at one of the three processing centres in all of Canada to prepare the boxes for shipping. The name “shoebox ministry” was dubbed back when our church first got involved  with <a href="http://www.samaritanspurse.ca/occ/">Operation Christmas Child (OCC)</a> through an organization called the Samaritan’s Purse. Back then, standard OCC shoeboxes were not provided and so we filled old shoeboxes with toys, hygiene products, and small gifts into shoeboxes for boys and girls from the ages of 2 to 14 who lived in countries that were less fortunate than us. Back then, I didn’t understand what the $5 was for, but after a day of volunteering, I see why it’s needed to cover the costs of packaging and shipping.
</p>




<p>
Now as inspectors at the processing centre, we carefully inspect each box to check for noticeably used items, items that may break, leak, or harm a child (including items with warning signs) and donate those to local charity as international customs may delay a delivery of such goods. Furthermore, safety is a number one priority. I learned that even cosmetics were no-gos. However, they should add a policy that expired toothpaste should also be taken out ; I don’t think it’s especially good if kids swallow it :|. I liked doing it so much that I’m going back again this Friday 🙂 (if I had a vehicle, I may even consider going every weekend!).</p>




<p>See, you can tell that I had fun (haha, well my face sure doesn’t show it):

In the shower the other day, I reflected on why God made people (and gave thanks to the friends I’ve known). And, echoing the thoughts of miss jo, certain people cross your path in life for some reason or another; maybe to make you less selfish in the process and/or to let you have a glimpse of how they live their lives differently. Lately, I’ve noticed how certain people interact with their families. When people are around family, their masks are let down and the real “them” shows through. If I had a spotlight of the month, I would highlight a friend of mine, who often says he is selfish (well, that’s something I need to work on as well!). Yet as an observer, I see beyond what he says and realise that often, love overcomes any hints of selfishness, or rather, action supersedes words. I don’t know if I would offer to cook my mother a meal so that she could sit down and enjoy a movie, or as a guy, to hug/kiss another family member openly in front of others. I know my brother stays as far away from hugs as possible because it’s “embarassing” and “not cool”, and yet, my friend (my age!) does this. I think if and when I have kids, it would be a blessing to have an affectionate family :).  I have a lot to learn.

I had so much to say, but I have since forgotten it all or they are no longer relevant (like how the I Agree With Byron campaign spawned an entire weeks’ worth of discussion on the uw.general newsgroup). Thanks for your patience in the last few weeks.</p>




<p>Praise God for the good things that He’s given to me. This past week, I was just thinking how He’s provided everything thus far including the opportunity to be in awe of the aurora borealis (aka, the northern lights); what I saw in Edmonton quite some years ago is no comparison. PT and Chris are always so generous and kind, providing me a place to stay and offering to rent out bloovale to me (I’m 90% sure that I’ll take it – I went there today and it’s spacious and definitely not like the student-ghettos). I think I also will have access to a vehicle next term 🙂</p>




<p>One observation I did note, is the people at my current company seems to swear a whole lot more (in reference to each other and to the computer) and a whole lot more people smoke. At my last place, only 2 people were smokers (~4%) and swearing was quite rare in comparison. Hrm, an indication of a high-stress environment and what’s to come? O_o</p>
