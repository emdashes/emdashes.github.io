					<description><![CDATA[According to my optom friends, when you can&#039;t tell the difference between 1 and 2, that&#039;s actually good :) Because they&#039;re narrowing the difference, and eventually the difference is so small, that they&#039;re closer to pinpointing... whatever it is that they are looking for.
Experiment from a different perspective, perhaps through the optom&#039;s eyes.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Oooh, nice new picture.  You are being so secretive with these new decisions of yours.  Your last post was the same way.
I suppose if both 1 and 2 look good, just go with whatever makes you happier.  ]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[oh, I like this one!
I hate the optometrist. I hate not being able to tell the difference (which is always the case)!
And I hate making difficult life decisions too. Good luck with yours! :)]]></description>
