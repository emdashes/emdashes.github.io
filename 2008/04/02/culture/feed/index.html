					<description><![CDATA[Yeah it irks me that it&#039;s become so commonplace. It makes marriage more of a rubber stamp than a milestone. I also came across a stat that couples that live together before marriage are 50% more likely to divorce. I can&#039;t explain that one easily but I sure took note!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Yes, that&#039;s what my Singaporean coworkers said, married people get a good government rate housing -- very important when property prices are rapidly rising.  But I don&#039;t know what means if people apply for a divorce, though Singapore is a slightly more conservative culture anyway.  Anyway, that would be an interesting study: to see whether this housing policy has impacted the &#039;definition&#039; of relationships / marriage / families.  Haha]]></description>
