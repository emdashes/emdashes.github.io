					<description><![CDATA[Oh boy!  You think you&#039;re bad at Chinese.  Mine is mostly gone now. I can actually hear the accent slipping in now when I try to speak in Chinese.  I do, however, notice one oddity: I automatically put a Chinese accent onto my English when I mix it with Chinese or if I&#039;m speaking to my parents.  It&#039;s very odd.  ]]></description>
