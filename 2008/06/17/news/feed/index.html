					<description><![CDATA[Hi Em!
Congratulations!  I heard from my mum, lol!  I was looking for you yesterday, but I didn&#039;t see you online.  Were you in town?
Strange to finally hit this stage in life, huh?
I&#039;m happy for you.  Fall would be lovely  :)  Can I help with decorations?  :D]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[thanks everyone! i especially enjoyed chiz&#039;s and b&#039;s initial response.
@mur - i won&#039;t be in town until next month but i guess news travels fast. it does feel very strange to &quot;finally hit this stage in life&quot;!  - it&#039;s taking some time to sink in so we haven&#039;t even thought that far yet (the decor)!
@l - the easter egg is one of the pics in the last post (if some had found it, they would&#039;ve known about the news before everyone else).]]></description>
