					<description><![CDATA[Hello b.p.!
All of us here at RCR Hospitality are marvelling at the incredible food shots you took while at CUT. The lighting was perfect out on the private deck! Of course, we are wondering if there is any way that you would consider allowing us to use a couple of these shots in our upcoming advertising and PR materials. Could you get back to me at hollie@rcr.ca and let me know? Again, they are really beautiful - and believe me, here at RCR we look at a lot of food photography!
Thanks for your consideration,
Hollie Quick
