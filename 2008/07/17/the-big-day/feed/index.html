					<description><![CDATA[bb, nothings wrong with you. im like you but i wouldnt call myself old-fashion. i think weddings are blown out of proportion &amp; i just preferred to be married &amp; begin a new life stage. 1 yr worth of planning &amp; organizing for a wedding is not my cup of tea. marriage is the exciting part, not the wedding. however i hope you are excited about marriage! ]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Everyone thinks like this when it&#039;s months away from their wedding (i.e. being practical and wanting to just be &#039;married&#039; and move on with it).
But post-wedding, if you ask people if they would have done it differently (i.e. sans all the wedding-hoopla), they probably wouldn&#039;t change it.
Despite the stress of wedding planning, just try to keep the perspective that your friends &#039;want&#039; to be there to celebrate/witness your special day. As well, it&#039;s going to be an unique event in your life where you will be able to see/catch-up with all your best friends all in one place.
Hang in there ... it&#039;ll be over sooner than you think]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t think you necessarily need to be giddy and jumping around over the big day. Doesn&#039;t make you dysfunctional. ;)
On the other hand... getting really excited about it makes it a lot more FUN! :) (and less stressful because that way at least you&#039;re enjoying it.)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[fugi has a good point however friend expectations are different across individuals. for me, i dont carry around many close friends or friends, and therefore dont feel the need to celebrate with the entire world. however those who have many contacts may feel to have a bigger celebration. its different for everyone :) unfortunately, $$ is sometimes the deciding factor. if i had the $$ i would definitely invite more ppl.]]></description>
