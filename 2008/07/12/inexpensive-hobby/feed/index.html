					<description><![CDATA[wow! black&#039;s used to have PI film for 2.99! that&#039;s crazy! not anymore!
photography has certainly become more accessible that basic point and shoot digital cameras are so cheap, but with that accessibility comes a deterioration of the art (i feel), since ppl just click like no tomorrow yet still don&#039;t even know how to use 1) the focus 2) probably 90% of the functions on their camera
so maybe half the world isn&#039;t into photography as it really is- they&#039;re just into catching themselves and posting it online for everyone to see.
on the flip side, it becomes quite an expensive hobby if you&#039;re into it more seriously =) like how steve has been spending. haha.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I think I may fall into the &quot;click like no tomorrow&quot; category especially with digital now and I sure don&#039;t know 90% of the functions on my camera - I seem to learn by observing how others use my camera to produce their shots =)... Still learning as I go!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[haha... yes, steve has been spending a little too much on his camera and everyday he goes around thinking.. hmmm, wouldn&#039;t this lens be great for taking that shot :p  on my wishlist: a fisheye!  but steve has a plan to get it cheap, hopefully. :p
as i read somewhere.. the diff between an amateur and a prof is that the latter knows what pictures to delete and what to show.]]></description>
