					<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s interesting to note that Canadians did have a real choice for change at the ballot box this year.  One big difference that I noticed about the change offerened, while significant in substance, is that it wasn&#039;t delivered with nearly the quality of packaging that the Obama campaign brought to the fore.
When offered this change, Canadians rejected it and chose the status quo.  I wonder if, in the end, there is true qualitative difference between change that&#039;s offered with slick packaging and beautiful speeches, and change that&#039;s offered much more modestly.  Cannadians, it would seem to me, much prefer the former to the latter.
Yes, this is a small lament for Stephane Dion and his Green Shift.  Alas, both appear to be on their way out, to be replaced by, as far as I can tell, far more typical politicians.  This was  change that, it seems, we didn&#039;t want.]]></description>
