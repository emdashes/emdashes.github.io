					<description><![CDATA[I happen to agree with L.  I think that group projects are more realistic to real life.   It&#039;s only in very organized businesses with good management that you get what you described.  In other jobs, people do end up forming mish-mash groups where one or more people just gradually shift into leadership roles, someone just assumes leadership, everyone just cooperates, or no one is the leader and the group falls apart.
I always preferred lectures, essays, and assignments too, but the group projects force you out of your comfort zone and you can inadvertently make some friends. ]]></description>
