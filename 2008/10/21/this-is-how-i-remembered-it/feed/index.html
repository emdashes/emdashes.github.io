					<description><![CDATA[Hm, how interesting that you were so strikingly aware of it while you were in elementary school.  I remember not knowing much English at all when I started kindergarten, but that was never a problem because most of the kids were still trying to grasp the language due to age.  I think I learned English from my neighbor, come to think of it.  (The same neighbor who convinced me to eat toothpaste and vaseline.)  For the most part, being Chinese was something that my teachers found cool and interesting.  It was never looked down upon or criticized.  My classmates even learned to eat seaweed snacks with me!]]></description>
