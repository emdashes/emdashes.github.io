					<description><![CDATA[Hi B.P.
I used to never really save much on anything until I got married!  Now, I try to save on sales when I can: Groceries and pharmaceuticals are where we try to take advantage the most.  We try to get the best travel deals too, especially when it comes to transportation.  That said, we won&#039;t go for any low - the cheapest doesn&#039;t always win.  We&#039;re also concerned with how and where something gets produced and we&#039;re willing to pay for that.
There are consequences to always going for cheap - and I don&#039;t just mean that we sometimes get crappy stuff.  Those consequences can affect the people who do the work to produce the goods and services we receive.  To that end I think that Luke 16:1-14 outlines some excellent principles for how we should view &quot;cheap&quot;.

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m way more aggressive in an environment where I can bargain i.e. Asia. I try to bring the price down as much as possible but also in doing so I&#039;m more generous in that I&#039;d buy more things. I just try to maximize on value in general - look for things on sale etc]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I listen to DNTO too! At first I couldn&#039;t figure out what it stood for until she said it.
To some people cheap means saving 50%+ on any item, so even if the name brand T-shirt was $100 now on sale for $50, then that&#039;s cheap! I don&#039;t believe in that. I don&#039;t think any T-shirt is of such high quality due to &quot;better brand&quot; to pay $50.
I&#039;d say that I try to save on clothes as well, especially when at places I know is a big company and it&#039;s simply overpriced cause I&#039;ve seen it on sale repeatedly before. Although, for clothes that I wear on a regular basis (jackets, shoes etc) or for special happenings like sports, camping and maybe some work clothes that affects my comfort level, I&#039;m more willing to pay more for quality than bad quality.
I generally agree with your other items of what I&#039;d spend more on, like the experiences or specialty interests that just cost more (ie photography).]]></description>
