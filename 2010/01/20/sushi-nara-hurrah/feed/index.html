					<description><![CDATA[I know Ariella is a food too and her blog often makes me want to try some of the foods that you both try!
I didn&#039;t actually really get into Korean food until after my trip to Korea :) I&#039;ll have to keep Koreana in mind - I used to like going to the right off of Kingsway, by Mr. Ho&#039;s Wonton House (name escapes me right now)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I love Korean food ! and I am just learning to order it.  It did help after Ariella went to Seoul two winters ago, and now i am depending on her to tell me what to order.
next time when you come back, make sure you stop by Koreana at Westwood in Coquitlam, they have a really really good BBQ menu, and the price is very decent.  Just make sure you dress &quot;down&quot; when you go, preferrably your sweats, so you can throw them in your wash the minute you go home....you will wear the fragance.  yummm...it is really good. ]]></description>
