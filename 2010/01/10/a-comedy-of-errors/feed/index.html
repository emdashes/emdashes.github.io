					<description><![CDATA[oh yes, the joy of travelling at Christmas time.
my flight back from Mexico was uneventful, but my extended family&#039;s flight back to Regina was nothing but fun. They could not get clearance to leave the Cancun airport at 1;00am in the morning, as the person who was supposed to be on duty left for home without letting anyone know. (??) They had to call him back, by the time the plan took off it was almost 4am in the morning.
yikes. ]]></description>
