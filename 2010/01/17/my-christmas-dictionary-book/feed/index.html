					<description><![CDATA[I like the definitions of Gift, then Present, and the definitions of Quick and Fast :)
based on the grammar and spelling, I was probably around 6 or 7 years old. I did it in my spare time (instead of as a part of school or Sunday school) since it was on placemat paper :p]]></description>
