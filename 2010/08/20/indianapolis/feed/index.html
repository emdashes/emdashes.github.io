					<description><![CDATA[Hmm, you would &quot;register&quot; to attend ahead of time (just like you would sign up for games, to play in tourneys, for workshops and talks) - but that&#039;s really so that they can get a room that&#039;s the right size for the people, prepare communion cups (apparently what they use for prison ministry: 2-in-1 - you peel back the top for the wafer, and another layer for the &quot;wine&quot;).
Joseph tells me that the praise/songs part of worship used to be lead by a guitarist, but he died unexpectedly a few years ago. Ever since then, they have switched to following a taped or cued recording. Everyone follows along with printed lyrics. A hired preacher (pastor) delivers the sermon. It&#039;s a little strange to see people in costume (think male with long-haired wigs) coming to worship, but hey, we&#039;re at Gen Con and Jesus loves them all :)
The only deep-fried novelty that I would go back to is the deep-fried bacon...Mmmm, mmmm.]]></description>
