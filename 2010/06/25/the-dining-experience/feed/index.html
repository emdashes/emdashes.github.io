					<description><![CDATA[I have had essentially the same 2 experiences. TBK is all over the great service. Sounds like you had the same waitress as we did @the41 - uninterested, unaware, bored etc. Saw the &#039;specials&#039; menu advertised on twitter only to walk into the restaurant and have her say she had no idea what we were talking about. Too bad!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[really?! on the FLOOR?! That&#039;s just gross. Pub or not, you&#039;re not supposed to just chuck things on the floor =P
Hurray to free desserts! It didn&#039;t even seem like something they had to do. I think I would&#039;ve been happy to have the dish re-made for me =P ]]></description>
