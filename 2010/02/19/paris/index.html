		<p>				This past weekend will likely be one of the most eventful weekends in 2010; it marked the start of the Winter Olympics, Chinese (Lunar) New Year, Valentine’s Day (for some), Reading Week for the students, and an extra long weekend for some provinces (Family Day)!</p>




<p style="text-align:center"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aimeili/4371112200/" title="IMG_1696 by b.p., on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4053/4371112200_55c50db5eb_m.jpg" width="160" height="240" alt="IMG_1696"></a></p>




<h3>Sights</h3>




<p>For us, we went back to Europe, despite it being only a short three day trip (well it spanned 5 dates, but 1 red-eye and 1 day spent flying).  <a href="http://www.redflagdeals.com/deals/main.php/alldeals/comments/air_france_toronto_montreal_ottawa_round_trip_to_paris_barcelona_rome_from" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">This was a impulse buy</a>: no refunds, and I had forgotten that I was taking a course (thankfully it was reading week). We didn’t intentionally plan to come because of Valentine’s – we had wanted to take advantage of Family Day, as one of us didn’t have enough vacation days. But yes, we spent Valentine’s Day at the Eiffel tower, but I’m not sure I see the romanticism in waiting in line to climb up the tall steel structure, or seeing the tower itself. In fact, we didn’t even go to the top because the lines were too incredibly long (even if you paid to walk up the stairs to the 2nd platform, you’d have to wait a minimum of 2 hours to get to the top via elevator from there). Actually, going for a carousel ride in front of the Eiffel tower seemed even more romantic! The other major places we visited were the Louvre, Notre Dame, and Arc de Triomphe, with a stroll down Champs Elysees from the Concorde, exploring the Catacombs, food shopping at La Galeries Lafayette, and a half a day in Versailles. I simply enjoyed exploring the streets and sampling the many foods I normally wouldn’t eat.</p>


<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aimeili/4370365539/" title="IMG_2026 by b.p., on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4010/4370365539_24e92cf60c.jpg" width="270" height="180" alt="IMG_2026"></a><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_InBf17rbs_c/S36FPmd4A-I/AAAAAAAAEsk/XMpibo9GrEY/s576/IMG_1829.JPG" width="123" height="180"><h3>People</h3>




<p>Our visit this time around felt more familiar to me – the graffiti on the walls surrounding the train tracks, the way the streets were structured and the number of small compact cars on the road reminded me of our last trip. Despite Rome having more architectural history, I think I like Paris more. Perhaps it is because the language was familiar enough to us (we could use elementary level French and didn’t have to resort to English unless absolutely necessary), or because the Parisians seemed more polite; accidental bumps always resulted in a “pardon” (sometimes an “excusez-moi”). Upon entering a store or a restaurant, one would be greeted by a “bonjour” or a “bonsoir”. I can’t pinpoint it exactly, but Paris feels more graceful or “light” than Quebec in some ways (and here I am thinking that if I stayed long enough, I would eventually pick up the language). Even the unsolicited buskers are creative in getting money – they jump onto the metro, play a few tunes on their accordians (and one even sang) before collecting tips; maybe it’s their passion in everything.</p>

<h3>Eats</h3>




<p>In Paris, it’s normal to see people walking around with a baguette in their hands, and no wonder, their baked goods, pastries, and desserts were almost always good. Actually, it’s funny because I found that “french” food didn’t have to be fancy (unlike French restaurants around here) and it tasted good; it was normal to have duck confit served with fries, crepes that you could grab on a street like a beavertail or in a restaurant (without the fancy fresh fruit toppings), or a plate of boiled potatoes and some slices of cheese (you melt the cheese on a metal plate and scrape it onto the potatoes) <a href="http://www.berthillon.fr/mag/fr/page-112620.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The best ice cream</a> in Paris was closed (Mondays and Wednesdays), so we settled on getting a tiny scoop of the same brand in a neighbouring bar. I don’t think I’ve ever had ice cream like it.</p>


<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aimeili/4370366381/" title="IMG_2105 by b.p., on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4050/4370366381_a95c2afbae_m.jpg" width="200" height="133" alt="IMG_2105"></a><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aimeili/4370380211/" title="IMG_2522 by b.p., on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2731/4370380211_e987fb7393_m.jpg" width="200" height="133" alt="IMG_2522"></a>


<p>The only horror is that servers simply take the bread from your basket that you don’t finish and put them into another basket for another table. And despite macarons looking so artificial and sweet, they were light and just melted in your mouth (the best one being the green matcha tea and the black sesame one that was 1.85 euro *edit: Google maps+Google helped me identify that it was at Pierre Hermé on Champs-Elysées, apparently just as famous as Ladurée which we didn’t know at the time* – normally they were 1.5 euro). Although pastries and dessert were expensive, I found that eating out, including fixed menus were more reasonable than in Italy – at least the gratuities and cover were all inclusive. And to save even more, you just needed to ask for a carafe of water (thanks to pre-trip research).</p>


<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aimeili/4371117788/" title="IMG_2172pp by b.p., on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2753/4371117788_906e38418b.jpg" width="400" height="282" alt="IMG_2172pp"></a>


<h3>Tourists</h3>




<p>Even though it was low season (cold!), the lines were long if you didn’t get there at the beginning of the day. Many students were off and Japanese tourists were everywhere with many tour groups, especially at Versailles. I’m never impressed at the tourists who try to cut into the queues, or the ones who don’t respect signs or people telling them that flash photography isn’t allowed. And maybe because it was cold (cloudy) that it affected the tone of my photos – the photos turned out disappointingly grey and definitely not as vibrant as the ones I captured in Europe last fall; they certainly reflected the “winter” feel. The climate though feels more like Vancouver winters than Ontario ones; it hovers around zero but mild enough to get around in a wool jacket, scarf, and boots, without having to worry about wearing North Face or Columbia jackets. In fact, the only people we ever saw wearing them were … tourists.</p>


<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aimeili/4370362087/" title="IMG_1735 by b.p., on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2736/4370362087_8ed283ba3e_m.jpg" width="200" height="133" alt="IMG_1735"></a><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aimeili/4371116502/" title="IMG_2041 by b.p., on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4004/4371116502_d23d628f44_m.jpg" width="200" height="133" alt="IMG_2041"></a>


<p>Random geek-speak: Anvers is a metro station in Paris and they pronounce it “On-veir”; I’ve been pronouncing the font name wrong all along! Also, on our way to Versailles, we passed by a Microsoft building and other modern buildings. I thought to myself, maybe this area is like the technology area. Well, at the Issy-Val de Seine stop, all these people got off the train!</p>




<p>I’ll leave off with a clip from our worship service at the American Church of Paris. And, maybe I should re-listen to the sermon, since I zoned out (after a red-eye) and didn’t quite understand the connection between King David, Valentine’s and accepting Christ.

					<p>Paris!  I was just there in early January with my roommate!  I loved it!<br>
I think the museums (and the food!) were my favorite parts.  I see you went to the Louvre.  Did you catch the Musee d’Orsay at all?<br>
Your photos are so much nicer than mine. 🙂  I like the one of the snaking line at the Tour d’Eiffel.  We didn’t go up in it b/c the line was too long and we were freezing b/c it happened to be the middle of a cold snap.<br>
I wish I had known about the American Church of Paris.  If we hadn’t flown out on a Sunday, it sounds like it would’ve been a really neat experience.</p>

					<p>I saw on FB that you went to Paris – how long were you there for and what did you do?<br>
Did you post any of your photos? We didn’t get a chance to catch Musee D’Orsay but that and Sacre Couer would be two place to go next time!</p>

					<p>I don’t recall much of a line at the Eifel Tower when we went.  Definitely no snaking line for sure!  We went to Sacre Couer and then checked out the outside of Moulin Rouge…so tiny…thought it would look bigger and grander based on the movie. haha</p>

Was our advice helpful or did your guide more or less tell you all you needed to know?</p>

					<p>@Peter: Your emails definitely helped – thanks for both your recommendations, especially with Chez Clement, and Galeries Lafayette, where we spent almost $100CDN on gourmet snacks to bring back! But, we couldn’t go to the rooftop cafe because by the time we tried to get to the top, the eating areas were closed 🙁 We did the walk from la Concorde to the Arc de Triomphe (in reverse of what HZ suggested). We had a Le Notre (I think it might be a chain) just outside our hotel area and on the very last day, J picked up a coffee éclair and it was amazing! I couldn’t justify paying so much for that tiny pastry so I didn’t get one, but after tasting it, I can understand why people would pay for it!</p>

I was effectively in France from Dec 28 until Jan 9; 4 of those days were spent in Paris.  I haven’t posted any photos yet, though I did take lots — I’m terrible when it comes to uploading photos.  (I am like 4 weddings and 3 birthday parties behind . . . sigh).<br>
We were going to go to sacre coeur but eventually decided that it would be too cold on top of the hill.  (The weather really was absolutely bitter while we were there).  M (my roommate) says that it’s a lot more fun in the summer.  I’ll have to go back someday to see what she means. 🙂</p>

					<p>I went to Paris (my first Europe Trip) with my high school friends in grade 11. hehe…quite a long time ago. I went to the top of the Eiffel Tower actually. It was quite an amazing experience to see the whole view of Paris from up there. Which museum do you like the best? I personally like Musee d’Orsay. Did you see Mona Lisa at L’Ouvre?<br>
I actually wanted to go to Rome next time if I’m going to Europe. I really like looking at the architecture and culture.</p>
