					<description><![CDATA[I went to Paris (my first Europe Trip) with my high school friends in grade 11. hehe...quite a long time ago. I went to the top of the Eiffel Tower actually. It was quite an amazing experience to see the whole view of Paris from up there. Which museum do you like the best? I personally like Musee d&#039;Orsay. Did you see Mona Lisa at L&#039;Ouvre?
I actually wanted to go to Rome next time if I&#039;m going to Europe. I really like looking at the architecture and culture.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@b.p.
I was effectively in France from Dec 28 until Jan 9; 4 of those days were spent in Paris.  I haven&#039;t posted any photos yet, though I did take lots -- I&#039;m terrible when it comes to uploading photos.  (I am like 4 weddings and 3 birthday parties behind . . . sigh).
We were going to go to sacre coeur but eventually decided that it would be too cold on top of the hill.  (The weather really was absolutely bitter while we were there).  M (my roommate) says that it&#039;s a lot more fun in the summer.  I&#039;ll have to go back someday to see what she means. :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@Peter: Your emails definitely helped - thanks for both your recommendations, especially with Chez Clement, and Galeries Lafayette, where we spent almost $100CDN on gourmet snacks to bring back! But, we couldn&#039;t go to the rooftop cafe because by the time we tried to get to the top, the eating areas were closed :( We did the walk from la Concorde to the Arc de Triomphe (in reverse of what HZ suggested). We had a Le Notre (I think it might be a chain) just outside our hotel area and on the very last day, J picked up a coffee √©clair and it was amazing! I couldn&#039;t justify paying so much for that tiny pastry so I didn&#039;t get one, but after tasting it, I can understand why people would pay for it!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I know someone who will be particularly pleased to know that prefer Paris to Rome...  Just for that comment, you two will be better friends... ;-)
Was our advice helpful or did your guide more or less tell you all you needed to know?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t recall much of a line at the Eifel Tower when we went.  Definitely no snaking line for sure!  We went to Sacre Couer and then checked out the outside of Moulin Rouge...so tiny...thought it would look bigger and grander based on the movie. haha]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I saw on FB that you went to Paris - how long were you there for and what did you do?
Did you post any of your photos? We didn&#039;t get a chance to catch Musee D&#039;Orsay but that and Sacre Couer would be two place to go next time!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Paris!  I was just there in early January with my roommate!  I loved it!
I think the museums (and the food!) were my favorite parts.  I see you went to the Louvre.  Did you catch the Musee d&#039;Orsay at all?
Your photos are so much nicer than mine. :)  I like the one of the snaking line at the Tour d&#039;Eiffel.  We didn&#039;t go up in it b/c the line was too long and we were freezing b/c it happened to be the middle of a cold snap.
I wish I had known about the American Church of Paris.  If we hadn&#039;t flown out on a Sunday, it sounds like it would&#039;ve been a really neat experience.]]></description>
