					<description><![CDATA[Hm! I was just discussing this with one of my (non-Christian) coworkers recently. I was trying to explain why churches typically are against Halloween (I said that it was because it had roots in paganism).
But in the end many churches had &quot;Halloween alternatives&quot; anyways. Although I suppose that their motivation was probably to provide a safer venue (physically and spiritually), but isn&#039;t it still then celebrating it in a sense? Or does repurposing some of the activities (candy&amp;games) enough to remove any paganistic effects? And if it is, then is there still any real paganism when Halloween activities are just dressing up and going door-to-door to panhandle for candy anyways?]]></description>
