					<description><![CDATA[Hm I don&#039;t think I know of any places you wouldn&#039;t already be familiar with. I just like Herrle&#039;s haha. I see that the KW Little Theatre is listed as a participating business though! I&#039;ve only seen one of their productions before, but it was enjoyable. Their current show &quot;Albis&quot; sounds pretty neat if you enjoy mysteries. :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Sure, we&#039;ve had some new local adventures already - like buying from BaileysLocal or getting free mulch from Waterloo Region Waste Management (aka the dump) and livening up our garden with it! Do you have any local favourites?]]></description>
