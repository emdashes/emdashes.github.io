					<description><![CDATA[Oh, when I finally reached someone from Sears Executive Office and asked why, they said that they had hoped sending another car seat as a substitute would be better than sending none...(and what of the price difference?). Someone online also pointed out that we all were charged PST/HST even though you&#039;re only supposed to pay GST on car seats (per  http://www.fin.gov.on.ca/en/tax/hst/
In the end, I got them to send UPS to pick it up, but no confirmation from them that they refunded my order, until I received my credit card statement. They also claimed that they had no stock, even though at least three others received the correct model after they too complained (one after me and another because he works for CTV perhaps?)]]></description>
