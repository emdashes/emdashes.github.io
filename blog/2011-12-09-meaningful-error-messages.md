<span style="font-weight: 400;">With technology, it's inevitable that you have encountered an error message at one point or another and may have come to accept it as a part of life (like </span><a href="http://connections.rim.net/blogs/uxworkspace/entry/checkout?lang=en_us"><span style="font-weight: 400;">tolerating registration forms</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">). But like registration forms, they can be jarring: usually unexpected, and often interrupting your workflow. While some systems throw errors because of user action, others don't seem to be a result of an user action; for example, you might cringe when you hear "</span><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Screen_of_Death"><span style="font-weight: 400;">blue screen of death</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">" because you recognize the Microsoft Windows error that crashed your system, thus causing you to lose any unsaved work.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">So while errors may not be avoidable, we can try to lessen the impact. How?</span>
<ol>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prevent errors but recognize that they sometimes they do happen despite our efforts </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Good error messages help users diagnose and recover from the error such as including: </span></li>
</ol>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A problem. States that a problem occurred.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tell the user what’s wrong and how to fix it. A confusing, technical explanation that doesn’t help can make an annoying situation worse. </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A cause. Explains why the problem occurred. </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A solution. Provides a solution so that users can fix the problem. </span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Some examples of error messages that inform users a possible problem and a solution they can try (Twitter: come back in an hour, Firefox: start a new browsing session or restore most of your tabs):</span>

We expect to be back in about an hour. Thanks for your patient"[/caption]

<span style="font-weight: 400;">An example of an error message that may not be as helpful:</span>

[caption id="attachment_133" align="alignleft" width="366"]<img class="wp-image-133 size-full" src="https://ux.happyhippos.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/error.jpg" alt="" width="366" height="272" /> Error says: Unable to display this message.[/caption]

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The error message says: "Unable to display message," yet it is clearly able to display that message.</span>
<h2><b>Soften your tone</b></h2>
<strong>Be Positive</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Focus on progress, not on failure. Messages shouldn’t be harsh and critical so avoid using negative words like failed, denied, invalid, or fatal error.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Soften the message when the error is hardware or software bugs. Users are inconvenienced when they receive an error message and sometimes, there’s nothing we can do to help. When you’re the bearer of bad news, take a passive approach. Some organizations use humor to alleviate the inconvenience.</span>

<strong>Be Helpful</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tell the user what to do and how to do it.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don't blame the user: you can position error messages as helpful information rather than negative feedback. Avoiding “you” will help you state the problem without faulting the user.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Be Conversational</strong> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use everyday language.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Remember that people can make mistakes too. Focus on how to reduce the risk of user error, such as minimizing the user's cognitive load by ensuring that the user does not need to remember information from one screen to another.</span>
