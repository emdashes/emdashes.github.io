<span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=reEOSt9Qhgo&amp;list=PLNC_4kLSAqeuTsqzr29cNHpm9pCmhGm61" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sony Ericsson posted a video series of creative ads</a> to promote their smartphone against others, including the BlackBerry Bold 9700. The first time I saw one, I connected with them right away: </span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">This commercial was about smartphones </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">I marveled at the creativity of Sony Ericsson</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">I laughed because these scenarios were believeable and it's a peek into what I do in my current role: facilitate user sessions like usability tests and focus groups</span></li>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Sadly, these scripted comments are very believeable and likely reflect some true sentiments: </span>
<ol>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> "What does a smartphone do?" </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">A. "You call somebody, and you take a picture of somebody and text somebody."  (Toddler)

</span></li>
 	<li>"Does anyone know what the smart in smartphone stands for?"
<span style="font-weight: 400;">A. "I think the smart in smartphone means that like maybe the phone is more intelligent than you are...if you're not tech-savy, then the phone is more tech-savy than you."  (Model)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">..."this phone kinda makes me feel dumb" - I wonder if that's some of our consumers feel when they compare certain features of one smartphone with another, because I certainly hear friends say remarks like why can't this phone do X? While the scenarios may be a bit exaggerated and despite knowing that it's just an act ("dramatization with actors" in fine print), the facilitator does a great job in keeping a neutral expression, with neutral "mm-hmms" and "okay"s and noting down observations quietly. As a faciliator, it is often a challenge to not ask leading questions or bias the discussions with any sort of encouraging or discouraging response.</span></li>
</ol>
