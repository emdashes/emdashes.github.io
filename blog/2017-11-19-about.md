And, here's a little bit about me:

I spent the first half of my life in Greater Vancouver, but Kitchener-Waterloo is now home. I enjoy making and creating, and sharing life's stories; so by extension, you may find me telling others about what makes the #kwawesome community a great place to eat, live, play, and work.

A number of happy accidents brought me onto the user experience (UX) design path before UX became popular (and expected). I believe that anyone can make a difference towards a better product or service experience, so my approach is to educate myself and teach others by:
<ul>
 	<li><a href="http://ux.happyhippos.ca/learning/">Learning</a> - through interviews, usability testing, card-sort exercises, observation studies<a href="http://ux.happyhippos.ca/learning/"> </a></li>
 	<li><a href="http://ux.happyhippos.ca/creating/">Creating</a> - through sketches, wireframes, mockups, concepts and prototypes, design workshops</li>
 	<li><a href="http://ux.happyhippos.ca/sharing/">Sharing</a> -  through heuristic reviews, maps and flows, reports and findings, tips and blog posts, mentoring</li>
</ul>
