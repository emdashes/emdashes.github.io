The name, 'Talent Attraction Lab' seemed clinical but it also had a mysterious draw to it. Yes, I was curious, curious enough to sign up and voluntell j.w to go as well. Afterall, I knew what drew me to Waterloo (school, job), but didn't really explore why I had stayed, and what would make Waterloo Region "a better fit". I also wanted to hear if others had similar or different stories.

Turned out, only 3 of us attended with 2 moderators (one facilitator, the other a note taker) and we went through a couple of exercises, one being an emphathy map! I was even more interested because I had wanted to see how an empathy map worked, after hearing about it at UX Week 2011.

On the empathy map, we were to jot down thoughts that came to us around what we see, say, do, feel, hear, and think about the Region of Waterloo.

The second exercise was to create a post-it map (if I remember correctly) resulting from our feelings of why we came to Waterloo, what we liked (to do) in the area, and what the area lacked (ie. what where we came from had, that the area was missing - and what was so meaningful about it). I remember posting "mountains and ocean" as something I missed, but it was more than just the scenery - it was the accessibility to the great outdoors/natural scenic trails, to spend time with people who enjoyed doing that, and access to quality seafood.

The discussions that around these exercises was what was interesting: noted attitudes of the people of Waterloo versus Kitchener, the continued growth of the city (visible through infrastructure changes such as bus routes, construction, loud planes), and among all of it, I think we were in agreement that what keeps people around is their identity in the community. A community is about its people, and without them, or without people involvement, the community becomes lifeless, dull, and uninteresting; community creates the culture. This idea isn't anything new, but I could see visually see that now, through these exercises.

And, after spending over 7 years here now post-graduation,Â <a href="https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.418617594887.199591.505029887&amp;type=1&amp;l=beba1aa403" target="_blank" rel="noopener">I can still be intentional about making my time in Waterloo the best it can be</a>.
