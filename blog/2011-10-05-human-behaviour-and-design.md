<span style="font-weight: 400;">Are you using what you know about human behaviours in your design?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">At UX Week 2011, I attended a workshop led by Stephen P. Anderson, author of </span><a href="http://www.amazon.ca/Seductive-Interaction-Design-Effective-Experiences/dp/0321725522"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seductive Interaction Design</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and the creator of the </span><a href="http://getmentalnotes.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">mental notes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> pack. The Seductive Interaction Design workshop turned out to be a good complement to Human Factor International's PET (Persuasion, Emotion, Trust) course, which I have previously taken. I had hesitated to take this workshop at first, despite my interest and the popularity of the topic, precisely because I thought it would be redundant.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It was a good refresher anyway. I have known about the techniques to get consumers to buy from the PET course (such as "5 seats left" on airline sites), but one thing I took away from this workshop, was that we can make otherwise ordinary things (or rather painful but unavoidable things, like walking up the stairs or completing a registration form) into something more delightful to engage in: making it fun, or delighting.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Anderson started the workshop (and the book) with a video that was circulated awhile back by </span><a href="http://thefuntheory.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a VW initiative </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">where they took some everyday activities/ideas and tried to make it fun - like throwing out the trash instead of littering, or promoting the use the stairs instead of the escalator:</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In terms of websites, a website could be fine in terms of usability, with no obvious problems, but can it be improved to solve a high bounce rate or low adoption? The answer given was around removing the friction (ie. good usability) PLUS increasing the motivation (psychology; human behaviour) of engagement.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In terms of initial engagement, one needs to stand out from competition.  Which, actually tied in nicely with Todd Walthhall's comment the day prior that [good] experience design is our competitive advantage.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The business goals (outcome) should align with user goals (what people do), but Anderson stressed that knowing how humans behave or what motivates one, should not be used in manipulation coercion. We need to think about what poeple need to do in order for your business (goal) to be successful. His advice? Start with functionality, then build out the fun.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Sure, one could look to gaming techniques, but instead of motiviating human behaviour through game mechanics (a concept known as gamification), motivate through psychology. The first often focus on extrinsic rewards are often short-lived, but the latter focuses on instrinsic motiviation.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">So what motivates human behaviour? He shared some design ideas on how to do this, such as:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recognition with one's own name, human faces </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The desire to complete an incomplete set </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Desire for self-expression: customizing, creating own profile, self goals and association with self</span></li>
</ul>
