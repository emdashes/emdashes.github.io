<span style="font-weight: 400;">Last week, a variety of folks in and outside the core product team participated in a short </span><a href="http://goodkickoffmeetings.com/2010/04/design-studioprototyping-exercise/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">design studio</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> workshop. We had a design problem, and a room full of mostly non-designers who came together to brainstorm first as individuals (at least 8 designs independently), then as pairs (4 designs), and finally in groups (down to 2 designs). Even though sketching and designing isn't what they do on an everyday basis, every single person bravely sketched out a variety of ideas and shared them knowing that it would be critiqued (I sat out and facilitated this one, but I'm usually holding my breath at this step of the design process).</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;"><img class="alignright wp-image-122 size-large" src="https://ux.happyhippos.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/BESC1-1024x614.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="614" />The problem? </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have more than one product, how would the site display content and information that is specific to that product?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Results</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think this exercise paid off: a few common themes emerged at the end of this exercise; a couple emerged from participants that aren't on the product team but that the core team had been talking about but hadn't shared, and some new ideas were noted down. We came out with two wireframes that need be refined a bit before we have our customers test them out. The group did have practice by role-playing as computers and testing their prototypes on a "human" (another participant); we saw what part of the design was successful, and what might need some more work.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Our product manager was so inspired, that post-workshop, he even created a mockup based</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Â on the ideas he got during the workshop!</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Having a group of people from different business units and roles (inside and outside of the product team) worked well; those unfamiliar offered different perspectives, and weren't constrained with what they knew, which actually led to some great ideas and out-of-the-box thinking.</span>
