Following Web Directions North in Denver, it was a blessing to be able to fly to Vancouver to join the <a href="http://interaction09.ixda.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Interaction '09</a> conference at the Four Seasons hotel in downtown Vancouver. A few observations at this one:
<ul>
 	<li>Working notes at <a href="http://docs.google.com/View?docID=dwvxjdg_20g9cfzmf3&amp;revision=_latest" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Docs</a></li>
 	<li>Definitely a different calibre than WDN; more artsy, less technical.</li>
 	<li>For a conference on interaction design and user experience, I would expect much more in terms of contact information and response time</li>
 	<li>I hear that signage was lacking on the first day as well</li>
 	<li>Great sessions and keynotes overall. Learned what I want to do and what I want to avoid</li>
 	<li>I want to avoid sounding elitist/elite. Please gently remind me that this is not where I want to be/end up if I stick with interaction design.</li>
 	<li>Sketching is good. I'm glad that one field embraces sketches and doodles as a part of work.</li>
 	<li>People take notes in lo-fi (paper) notebooks! Most do not use their wi-fi notebooks (laptops) and one workshop forebade the use of mobile devices or laptops (as a result, I have yet to process my notes digitally)</li>
 	<li>Yet, the meaning of twitter became really apparent really quickly - each session had its own unique twitter ID (hash/tag) and tweets were posted on the screen in real-time</li>
 	<li>A free upgrade to King Executive Suite was a definite bonus. Thank you, <a href="http://www.fourseasons.com/vancouver/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Four Seasons Vancouver</a></li>
</ul>
