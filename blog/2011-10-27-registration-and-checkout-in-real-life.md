<span style="font-weight: 400;">Ever have a "what's my username or password?" moment? With many sites requiring a login or some sort of exchange in information, I am not surprised to see post-it notes on the side of computers and monitors to serve as reminders of which site uses which username and password combination. In the online world, we all seem to have accepted this for the most part: entering our username and passwords when requested, filling out the </span><a href="http://www.onlineaspect.com/2010/07/02/why-you-should-never-use-a-captcha/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">captcha</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and even going through multiple pages of a web form to try and purchase an item or sign up for an account. At least I have.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It was not until I saw this video that I'm reminded just how much we tolerate - and how much we force our customers to tolerate online:</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If this happened in a real physical store, you'd probably walk away too or react somehow (I know I am always a bit thrown off when a retail store asks me for my postal or zip code when I'm about to pay). So if we don't do this offline at physical store, do we really need to do this online, whether in the name of security or for legal reasons? Can we think of better ways to make the sign up or purchasing process easier for our customers?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">At a local convocation last week, I met a recent university graduate who told me about her struggles with using the school's online system. The university had introduced an online system where students could log in to view and pay their fees, enroll in classes, and view their transcripts. This enabled students to do everything online with convenience. But, she ended up having to go into the Registrar's Office to do all of that every term. Why? Because when she tried to create an account and entered her birthdate, the system reported that her birth year, 1928, was invalid (there's nothing wrong with getting a degree at 83 years old!). But that's how old she was and I was baffled that, she had to physically go into the office to do something that most of the other students had access to online.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Working with authenticated sites isn't something new; more often than not, we require our customers to sign up for an account before we allow access into the authenticated site. And, as a part of the sign-up process, we present them with a web form to collect their information. We just need to think about making it as frictionless as possible, as it is the "door" to our "storefront"; first impressions do count, and people do judge books by their covers, as much as we hope they won't.</span>
