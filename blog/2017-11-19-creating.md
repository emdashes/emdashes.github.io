When it's time to start creating, my process usually follows a cycle that looks loosely like this:
<ol>
 	<li><strong>Narrow down the design goal(s)</strong>, identifying the problem that we are tryingÂ to solve</li>
 	<li>Identify<strong> intended users</strong>, whether current and/or target</li>
 	<li>Identify current <strong>user flows</strong> or journey maps, and make revisions if necessary</li>
 	<li>Start <strong>sketching</strong> and/or host design sessions to gather ideas</li>
 	<li><strong>Wireframe / mockup</strong> some possibilities and share one or two with supporting rationale</li>
 	<li><strong>Validate</strong> with users</li>
 	<li><strong>Share</strong> findings and recommend change if necessary</li>
 	<li>Rinse and repeat</li>
</ol>
I consult with stakeholders throughout the process, even if it's to exchange ideas or thought processes (thinking-aloud applied!).

Some sample work that used this approach:
<ul>
 	<li><a href="https://ux.happyhippos.ca/creating/cardon-rehab/">Cardon Rehab</a>: offline software application for hybrid tablets (Windows Surface)</li>
 	<li><a href="http://ux.happyhippos.ca/creating/blackberry-expert-support-center/">BlackBerry Expert Support Center</a>: a desktop-based web portal</li>
 	<li><a href="http://ux.happyhippos.ca/creating/dine-o/">Dine-O</a>: an online ordering app and website for mobile and desktop, and a restaurant site for desktop and touch-based tablets</li>
</ul>
