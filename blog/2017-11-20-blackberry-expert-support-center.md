BlackBerry Expert Support Center was a web solution that provided self-services tools to help IT professionals and administrators (paying subscribers) manage and support their BlackBerry deployment in their organizations from their computers.

<h3>Goals</h3>
As more features and support tools were made available to this dedicated site, it needed to be more robust and be able to scale with new additions and dynamic updates.
<h3>My role</h3>
As the site evolved over the years, I led a number of user-research and design activities where the findings and recommendations resulted in UI changes of the site overall as well as the flow of individual tools, including:
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Usability studies</strong> using wireframes and prototypes to test ideas and the in-market product as a means to gather feedback of the current state</li>
 	<li><strong>Card-sort exercises</strong> to help with organizing the navigation</li>
 	<li><strong>Design workshops</strong> to bring together internal support representatives, developers, business analysts, and product managers in a safe space to share ideas and possibilities</li>
 	<li><strong>Reports</strong> summarizing the user-research sessions and an analysis of results, with a list of recommendations to review with product team and product manager</li>
 	<li>Documenting <strong>UI patterns and interaction design guidelines</strong> for the development team and product team to reference when specifying requirements or making changes that might impact the UI</li>
</ul>
I came out from these activities with <strong>sketches, wireframes, mockups and a few clickable prototypes</strong>, some more formal than others (on the glass window, a whiteboard, sketchbook). The UI deliverables were used to communicate the intended design and interaction behaviour to internal and external customers, and the business and development teams.

As a UX team of one, I tried to be as transparent as possible by being available and sharing my thoughts, and collaborated with business analysts, the product manager, and developers to understand feasibility and exchange ideas, even though the development team was not directly part of the product team. I also consulted with other people in user research and other UX roles, within the organization but outside my team for their expertise (such as how to recruit more participants when you've exhausted your resources).

By the end of 2015, I was using Axure and Visio to make and share wireframes, mockups, and clickable prototypes.[/caption]

UI changes that resulted from the above activities included:
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Information architecture:</strong> categorized menus instead of a vertical list of tools that grew as a new one was added; horizontal navigation menu instead of a vertical menu</li>
 	<li><strong>Displaying real-time information:</strong> the eventual move from a static website to the introduction of an overview / dashboard area with real-time system status and notifications</li>
 	<li><strong>Change in screen flows and UI</strong>, especially with the individual tools so that they are more user-friendly and have affordances that are consistent with wizard-type of tools</li>
</ul>
<h3>Impact</h3>
Hearing from the voice of the customer enabled the business to learn new insights that they never and structured user-research activities meant that questions or tasks could be repeated and the responses measured over time.

<strong>He said, she said:</strong>

<em>"Valuable tool, easy to use, virtually [took] no time at all; tremendously valuable, automated process."</em>
<em>"It's the best interface as far as support and information condensed that you guys have come up with so far."</em>

<em>"The number is in there, but difficult to find - wasn't where I expected it to be"</em>

<hr />

While the BlackBerry Expert Support Center no longer exists, some of the tools from its time are still being used in the current generation of the authenticated site. Furthermore, the work that was done on this site provided a great foundation for two other self-service support portals that I also worked on: one for carrier partners and one for BlackBerry support teams internally; even though the look and feel were completely different across the three systems, certain tools and components could be reused.
