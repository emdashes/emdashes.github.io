<span style="font-weight: 400;">Came across some tips on how to solicit design feedback for sketches, mockups, and business requirements that I shared with those on my team who is involved with design at times (and posting here for reference): </span><a href="http://zurb.com/article/1205/17-design-feedback-techniques-that-influe"><span style="font-weight: 400;">http://zurb.com/article/1205/17-design-feedback-techniques-that-influe</span></a>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Some great reminders for me:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Outline to the team the types of feedback that's being sought - include a link to any prototypes, wireframes or any work we've done, with clear explanations of what we've done and why. </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having more than a handful of people involved results in feedback from those that have no stake in the project. People will bombard the designer with feedback because they feel as if they have to contribute. Worse, it doesn't help move the project forward at all because the designer will be integrating feedback that won't improve the product. Target specific people on the team that can provide valuable insight. Who on the team has a stake in what's being worked on? Who is it that can provide actionable feedback? </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Email is great for starting a feedback loop, but not so much for closing it. The product design feedback can quickly get lost in a chain of emails going back-and-forth between several people. Context is lost. But email can create sparks among the team. Email can be used to outline the benefits of the work that's been done and link to prototypes or wireframes. </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Designers Rarely Have the Right Answers - But they need feedback from the right people. Know who to pull into the feedback loop based on experience. Building relationships with other members of the team is crucial. Get to know their strengths, their interests. Recognizing those skills can help in deciding whose feedback to seek. Say a designer is having a tough time with a code bit. Who is it on the team that is a code junkie? That person might yield the better feedback. </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Designers on your team need to quit being introverts all the time [thatâ€™s me :}</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">]. Understand that they need to seek out feedback from others. Follow through on that feedback and iterate based on what you've received. Show others the impact they made. Engagement and buy-in happens when others can see the fruits of their labor.</span></li>
</ul>
