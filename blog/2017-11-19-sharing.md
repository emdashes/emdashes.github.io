Because I feel that anyone can influence user experience, I share as much as I can to empower those that might not be as familiar with UX design.

Other than presenting findings, I have hosted lunch and learns so anyone can learn more about topics like design principles or product insights for those who aren't directly involved with the project or product. And, in my spare time, I often write down my thoughts or anything interesting that I have come across on <a href="https://ux.happyhippos.ca/blog/">a blog post</a> or shared through a status update.

Sample posts:
