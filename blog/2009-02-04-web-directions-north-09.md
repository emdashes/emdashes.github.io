Working notes on <a href="http://docs.google.com/View?docID=dhj2ngv_3cr6kzvg3&amp;revision=_latest">Google Docs</a>

Observations:
<ul>
 	<li>macs are the majority here</li>
 	<li>the gender balance is more equal this year</li>
 	<li>seems to be less people than previous wdn</li>
 	<li>next time, bring an extra power bar as outlets are a scarcity</li>
</ul>
