<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you asked me what the difference is between focus groups and usability studies, this is one extreme example that I may give you:</span>

<strong>Focus group</strong>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Usually consists of multiple participants with one facilitator.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you were a participant, and the facilitator asked the group, "How many of you wash your hands after going to the washroom?", would you say yes or raise your hand, especially if most people do?</span>

<hr />

<strong>Usability study</strong>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A usability study (or test, but I generally avoid using a "test" because it's not an exam) observes the user individually (1:1), with or without a facilitator present.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If the study was to find out how many people washed their hands after going to the washroom, one could instead of asking the question, observe what you actually do after going to the washroom.</span>
