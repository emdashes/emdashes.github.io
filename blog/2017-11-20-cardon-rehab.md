Cardon is a design, engineering and manufacturing company in the therapeutic healthcare industry, providing a line of physical products for healthcare professionals such as treatment tables and therapeutic exercise equipment. The R&amp;D team started on a project that had a offline, hybrid tablet component to assist healthcare providers track a patient's progress over time.
<h3>Goals</h3>
The team realized healthcare professionals didn't understand the screens as shown on the application based on some initial feedback they had heard when they demonstrated it but they were not sure how to improve it.

The data was initially presented in a series of graphs, charts, numbers and other graphical data, which is understandable since a team of engineers designed in it. The challenge was to take this rich dataset and present it in a way that is more understandable by physiotherapists and other healthcare professionals.

One constraint that I had to keep in mind was that the application is meant to be used on a touch tablet, so screen space is limited but would need enough space for touch and precision of keyboard-mouse interactions, such as pressing a button with a finger or clicking on a link with a mouse.
<h3>My role</h3>
After the first version was built, the team initially wanted to bring in a graphic designer to help make it better. After speaking with me, they understood that I wasn't there just to make the application look pretty, and that I would approach it more holistically from a UX perspective.

So, I set out to gather information and seek to understand the context and users through:
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Observations</strong> of how the system is intended to be used, how healthcare professionals currently support their patients and keep track of their progress</li>
 	<li><strong>Interviews </strong>with the internal team members, intended users and their support teams both on a one-on-one basis and with groups.</li>
</ul>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Observations and interviews helped me to map out what a typical day might look like for physiotherapists (the intended users), including how they interact with patients, what tools they use to support their job. By starting out with this, it also helped me identify the areas that didn't make sense to them in the application and have a better understanding of why.</p>

<ul>
 	<li><strong>Usability studies</strong> using clickable prototypes to test wireframe ideas</li>
 	<li><strong>Card-sort exercises</strong> to help the team understand whether the healthcare professionals understood labels and how data was grouped</li>
 	<li><strong>Expert reviews and reports</strong> summarizing the user-research sessions and an analysis of results, with a list of prioritized recommendations (usability impact, and ease of effort to fix)</li>
</ul>
<strong>Wireframes and mockups, and clickable prototypes </strong>came of these activities, which I used to communicate the intended design and interaction behaviour to the team, enabling them to have working versions of the software ready for use during usability studies.

A wireframe of an early version using Balsalmiq Mockups 3Initially, I had tried to keep within the theme and retain the graphs, but visually simplified, but through usability testing, I learned that it still did not resonate with the users, so it was back to the drawing board (that is, my sketchbook).

<strong>He said, she said:</strong>

<em><span style="font-weight: 400;">“[seeing the] percentage is nice”</span></em>

<em><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Not sure about what the graph would provide for me"
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">"need to understand what it means"</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span>

<h3>Impact</h3>
Through a series of user-research activities that I led, the team came to understand why the product wasn’t making the impact that they had hoped. I persuaded them to move away from presenting the graphical data outright to adopting an overview area instead to show progress. While the product is still to be used in-market, further rounds of user-research affirmed that the design was progressing in a better direction.

As I was only part of this project temporarily, I mentored and created templates (such as interview questions) as I went so that they could conduct some of these activities in my place, as some user-research is always better than none.
