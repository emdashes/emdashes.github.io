<span style="font-weight: 400;">A few months ago, </span><a href="http://www.uxwaterloo.org/2013/01/03/restaurant-experience-design/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">UxWaterloo</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> had the privilege of hearing design perspectives from a non-technology/software focused industry: a local restaurant group. By the end of the session, it was clear that designing a restaurant experience isn't much different than designing for a website. And, with job titles like "Brand Guardian", this local restaurant group certainly doesn't take this lightly.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Much of what they've learned can be applied to any space, not just at restaurants, which include:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Terminology: adopting the word "guest" instead of "customers" - which would impact attitudes towards the diners</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(similar to saying "IT Professionals" instead of "end-users" for example) </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inspiration and evolution: the restaurants are "never done" </span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inspiration comes from other experiences, such as other restaurants and dining experiences, magazines. cookbooks, photos, fonts, presentations </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The experience shouldn't be flat, it should be a sensory experience ("you might go for lunch, but you want to stay until 10 at night") </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Be open to change and [dining] trends. Focus on how to make the experience better - it never ends  </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Look at and compare with industry standards, such as sales, profits, retention rate of employees, profitable growth of guest count </span></li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Design process: it doesn't have to be the same approach across restaurants (or products) </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Design exercises: before reaching out to people, they ran through design exercises such as identifying target market, creating personas and storyboards/design boards </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Positive and negative experiences: write down a list of all the possibilities, and pay attention to feedback, such as: </span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Be appealing to more people (greater audience) </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Being more approachable </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Understanding people’s priorities/trends/economics (e.g. understand that families would rather give up date night = meal out, than take their kids out of hockey for example) </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">See positives: unforseen things and little happy surprises </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Experience is subjective; it's based on people's individual experiences </span></li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Challenges: understand that every industry has its own challenges </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Persuasion: sometimes you have to sell ideas internally first </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Collaboration: important to understand the vision and to feed ideas off of each other </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">People approach: they want a humanized brand, not a corporate entity </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Details: the small details count (including little items like the height of the bar for them) </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Feedback: be open to feedback and comments </span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the first month of one of their restaurants, they had a stack of completed comment cards </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Personal response is important for growth (their comments from the website go directly to a BlackBerry smartphone - they even told a story about a personal, in-person visit to a guest's home to try and make it right) </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We don’t always get it right” - it’s what you do about it something happens → find out what, why, and how to prevent next time </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Leading indicators/measures of success are through comments and feedback </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">People love to come because of new things, change </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Feedback are often solicited from customers that fit “target market” </span></li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Community: being local, being where the people are, is important. For them, design choices were often based on geography (e.g. "urban with suburban sensibility") </span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Their design agency's website, has this to say about one of the group's restaurants: "The restaurant has averaged + $120,000 a week in sales since opening." With over over 700 employees, this 45M$/year company must be doing something right. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
