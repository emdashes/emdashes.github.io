<span style="font-weight: 400;">Firefox 4 came out this past Tuesday. What's interesting is that Mozilla chose to use wireframes to highlight the new features in their What's New video:</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;"> <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-154" src="https://ux.happyhippos.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/firefox.jpg" alt="" width="370" height="255" /></span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">These wireframes look polished and clean, but the beauty of wireframes is that they don't have to be: wireframes can range from sketches on the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">back of a paper napkin</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or on a whiteboard to rich, digital formats like what is in the Mozilla What's New video. Unlike mockups (which should be closer to the final state), wireframes can be vague, but detailed enough to recognize key elements and features, such as images, placement of videos, links, or introductory text. In fact, the Mozilla User Experience team included what looks more like sketches throughout this next video:</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why I like wireframes:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Can be done anywhere and by anyone - you don't need to be a graphic or visual designer to create them, whereas mock-ups may need them </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">They're great illustration tools, to help visualize and socialize ideas and concepts, and finding out what works or what doesn't work </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Takes the focus away from wording and sentence structure or what image looks like (often using placeholders, such as </span><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorem_ipsum"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lorem Ipsum</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">) </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">They should be easy to re-use or change, without impacting details like colors, fonts, or words. Knowing what kind of content it is and how much content to expect may be helpful, but it it is usually unnecessary to know the exact wording. </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can use multiple tools to create them</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">A </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">few posts ago</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, I had mentioned what is in my toolkit, and these are the ones I find I use the most for wireframing:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Paper (sketchbook), post-its and whiteboard, Microsoft PowerPoint, Microsoft Visio (with </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Visio stencils</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">). I must admit that because of the stencils and ease of collaboration among team members (since many of them already have it or don't need to request special permissions for a license to install it), Visio is probably my top (and surprising) choice for digitizing wireframes</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Often times, I take a hybrid approach, piecing together what I know won't change (such as header and footers of a branded website) using SnagIt and Visio or PowerPoint.</span>

An example:

[caption id="attachment_155" align="alignnone" width="1024"]<img class="wp-image-155 size-large" src="https://ux.happyhippos.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/bluewireframes-1024x678.png" alt="" width="1024" height="678" /> PowerPoint (using PowerPoint's existing shapes and lines) illustration of a couple fictional web pages.[/caption]

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Can you tell what elements the boxes and lines represent?</span>
