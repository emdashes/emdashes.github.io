"Before online ordering was the new normal, one startup tried to make an ordering app that would have an edge over its competitors, by allowing you order ahead even if you had intended to eat in.
<h3>Goals</h3>
Two primary users, two different and separate flows, three mediums, one web application:
<ul>
 	<li>Restaurants needed to be able to create and update the menu online and handle ordering through a website on a touch-based tablet</li>
 	<li>Customers needed to be able to order and customize one or more items in single transaction and be notified on the status of their order through a smartphone, either through the website or through a downloaded app</li>
</ul>
Despite having two instances of the same application, I had to consider that while the two views might look different, they had shared screens like branding and authentication, and they still needed to communicate with each other and handle real-time notifications well. Because there are different tasks the restaurants could do and manage, the restaurant view was definitely the harder of the two to get right.
<h3>My role</h3>
As the founder came from a technical background, he wanted my help with designing a system that would integrate well with a restaurant's ordering flow and the customer's order, whether they ordered from the restaurant's website or from Dine-O directly while on their phone or computer. Because it was a start-up idea, it was a lean team of two to start: a developer and a UX lead (me).

So, I set out to gather information and seek to understand the context and users through:
<ul>
 	<li><b>Competing products</b>, by reviewing what other apps and ordering services are available and identifying what they do well</li>
 	<li><strong>Interviews </strong>with the internal team members and restaurants to learn about their current ordering flows</li>
 	<li><strong>Usability studies</strong> with restaurants and those who order to validate wireframe flows - most of the time, this was done at the end of an interview session</li>
</ul>
These activities led to <strong>sketches,</strong> <strong>wireframes and mockups </strong>of the UI which were used to communicate the intended design and expected interaction behaviour which the team quickly converted to working versions of the software for use during usability studies.

<h3>Impact</h3>

Because of this, I was able to gain insight and context in those conversations, and learn some useful information without formally doing UX research.

<em>""you completely, utterly lost me. I would give up by now”
</em><em>""might be harder [to use] if [we have] less staff, but better than [a] phone order""</em>

<hr />

By talking to restaurant owners and managers, I discovered that their model / paradigm for online ordering was different than what we expected. Even though I worked in the restaurant / food industry before, I was not familiar with the terms that they used in the industry, which we corrected in the restaurant view of the app."
