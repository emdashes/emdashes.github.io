One of the best ways to find the right approach to improve a product is to understand the user needs and goals, while keeping assumptions and constraints in mind. I seek to gain context by <strong>learning about the customers</strong> such as who they are and what the user flow is like; <strong>the product </strong>such asÂ what it is, how customers currently interact with it, or what its competitors are; and, the <strong>business goals </strong>and product strategy.
<h2>Learning through user-research</h2>
I get a better understanding through qualitative user-research activities, including:
<h3>Observations</h3>
<ul>
 	<li>Shadowing support phone calls, lurking in user forums, testing and using the product or a pre-release (alpha/beta) version of it;</li>
 	<li>Observing people in the wild and people using the product in their everyday routine</li>
 	<li>Researching competitors or similar applications in a different space</li>
 	<li>Looking at web metrics or metric reports (such as clicks, page visits, entry and exit links) to spot trends or unusual patterns of behaviour that could be worth exploring further</li>
</ul>
<h3>Interviews</h3>
<ul>
 	<li>Focus group / panel discussions / group interviews</li>
 	<li>One-on-one interviews</li>
</ul>
<h3>Usability studies</h3>
<ul>
 	<li>In-person and remote moderated usability studies</li>
</ul>
<h3>Surveys and Card-Sort Exercises</h3>
<ul>
 	<li>Surveys that are completed in person, either before an interview or usability study;</li>
 	<li>Follow-up surveys, either after a usability study or after using a product</li>
 	<li>Open and closed card-sort exercises help me understand a person's mental model of how information (such as navigation) should be organized (information architecture)</li>
</ul>
By speaking to people who use the product, be it the customer, support representative, or sales representative for example, <strong>I hear some different perspectives and uncover some unexpected insights</strong>; what they say can be very powerful and persuasive whether is <strong>to affirm a design decision</strong> or <strong>to support a design change</strong>.
