<span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to collaborative wireframing (where you want to ask for feedback from team members, or have team members contribute), I find that most of my team prefers using Visio. If you also find yourself using Visio for this purpose, here are some tips that may help you save some time:</span>
<ol>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use </span><a href="http://connections.rim.net/files/app?lang=en_US#/person/EC6CCE9E-4C9D-43AB-9832-C1FA96FE92ED/file/92462d1b-f7bb-437b-8d7b-1af7e7ad04aa"><span style="font-weight: 400;">stencils</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (otherwise known as shapes) - either make your own, or customize some pre-made ones. Drag and drop the ones you'd like to use on your page</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make a template from a document, so that you can always start a blank document  with your preset stencils and an expected page size </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are using the same background, such as a website framed with the same navigation bar or footer, you can either: </span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">designate a page as a background, and then create subsequent tabs with the template tab as the background. This way, the background is locked in place and you won't have to worry about deleting it either (how? right-click on the bottom tab and change page properties or insert a new page with the first page as a background - see screen 3a example) </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">or lock the object / layer in place (how? In newer versions of Visio, you have to assign an object to a layer and lock the layer that way, but in previous versions, you can just right-click on an object and turn off/on the lock through the behaviour properties - see screen 3b example) </span></li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">To copy an object, instead of right clicking and selecting copy and then clicking again to paste, you just need to press Ctrl+click and drag object to where you want to paste it to duplicate the object </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Resizing an object: click on Alt or Ctrl while dragging the corners to resize an object without changing its porportions. </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">When moving an object, it often snaps to a point, but if you want to nudge it over pixel by pixel, then press Shift + move (I prefer using the arrow keys over the mouse) </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you want to move or group multiple objects, I find that the easiest way is to group them together either by Ctr+clicking on each one you want, or you use your mouse to draw a box around the group that you want, as long as the box starts beyond where the objects lie </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">To align objects, you can use the align tool, or use a visual guide by clicking on the rule and dragging downward to create a horizontal guide and dragging right to crate a vertical guide. When you are done with the guide, you can just hit the delete key on the guide to remove it. (screen example: horizontal guide is in blue under the search bar)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Photoshop tip: Sometimes, quick fixes can be done in Visio without needing to use Photoshop, tweaks like transparent objects to make buttons look disabled</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span></li>
</ol>
