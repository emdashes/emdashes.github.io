<span style="font-weight: 400;">I find that classroom/lecture-based learning is a good balance to attending conferences and seminars. However, due to cost-saving measures, sometimes it means I need to be a little more creative in finding alternate (read: free) options that are more cost-effective, such as:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Participating in </span><a href="http://www.communitech.ca/peer2peer/group-listing/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Peer2Peer groups</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> offered by Communitech</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Attending webinars and lunch&amp;learns </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Signing up for free 3-15 week courses online with post-secondary institutions around the world </span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">You may have heard off </span><a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Khan Academy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, an online resource that provides individual lessons around specific topics that you're interested in, or </span><a href="http://www.codecademy.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Codeacademy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (hands-on coding step-by-step tutorials). </span><a href="http://coursea.org"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Coursea</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is very similar, but it partners with </span><a href="https://www.coursera.org/universities"><span style="font-weight: 400;">post-secondary institutions</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to offer non-credit, online course-based curriculum around a variety of topics. While there is no set class time or in-person attendance or fee required, there are often weekly tests or assignments that may be marked by your peers, which make sure that you don't fall behind. A grade with a completion certification is issued to you, at the completion of the course. Once you complete a course, the assignments, tests, and video lectures remain accessible to you.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are the ones I've completed so far and ones I've signed up for:</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">When I first signed up, I was skeptical that I would find motivation to complete the assignments (and thus, the course), but I have since learned about different approaches and perspectives in methodology and designing intentionally to improve user experience or to change user behaviour (for the better), and see how it's articulated.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">What I've taken away as examples and reminders in these courses:</span>
<ol>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">from Human-Computer Interaction (more of a refresher for me personally) </span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Different methods of evaluation achieve different goals (e.g. using surveys to get quick feedback from a large group, but knowing it's self-reporting, not actual behaviour) </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apple designs experiences around activities, rather than around products </span></li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">from Gamification </span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gamification is using game elements and game design techniques in non-game contexts </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Often includes concepts in design, psychology (motivation), strategy, and technology </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Goals of gamification can be to form habits (affecting behaviour change), address engagement gaps, and/or allow for progression or choices, often through a social dimension </span></li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">from Design: Creation of Artifacts in Society </span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Designing an artifact (a product or a service) is ultimately to address a gap </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Happens through an iterative process: </span>
<ol>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sense gap </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Define problem </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Explore alternatives taking into factors of cost, wow, elegance, and beauty </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Select plan </span></li>
</ol>
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">User needs are key, but keep in mind that user needs can be contradictory; not all users will value every user need; and, not all needs are equally important. May be able to identify user needs through observation and interviews, but there may also be latent needs that aren't expressed that can be observed via non-verbal cues, interpreted and designed around (translates to delighting the user)  </span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">This last one was a fun and challenging course, as we were expected to sketch concepts, and make prototypes of a product to address a gap within 8 weeks. Here's a sample of what progressed:</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Gap: In what way might we create a solution for holding different toothbrushes and accessories so to minimize area of clutter and to free up the cup for drinking water</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Key user needs:</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(latent needs in !)</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The holder is a better alternative than placing a toothbrush in the cup </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anyone [who uses a cup] can reach and use the toothbrush holder </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The solution holds items of varying sizes </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The solution hold one or more items </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The holder is low maintenance </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">!The holder is appealing to use </span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Ended up with:</span>
