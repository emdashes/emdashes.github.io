<span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier this year, I had a chance to drop in on a couple of talks during </span><a href="https://developers.google.com/events/io/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google I/O "Extended" 2012</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at the Tannery, Downtown Kitchener. While most of it was very technical in nature (with streamed talks about performance and caching), one live session covered innovation and science fiction, a bit abstract, but had a good take away: sometimes, you don't need to look too far to get inspiration. The speaker used science fiction as an example of looking to other cultures for inspiration, specifically Darth Vader's helmet: it's actually based on the </span><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kabuto#In_popular_culture"><span style="font-weight: 400;">kabuto, a Japanese helmet worn by samurais</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Sure, we can look to other cultures for inspiration, but we can learn a lot from our surroundings as well. A couple years ago, I had the opportunity to go with a small team to observe commuters, specifically what they did with their smartphones, if any. This isn't what I normally do, but it gave us insight (and later, ideas) on what people in real life without the need to interrupt what they were doing by asking questions. There were times that I wanted to ask them questions, but it would have defeated the purpose of the exercise.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">From what I remember, here's what I learned (can't find my notes!):</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Commuters tend to be in two distinct groups: 1) solo travellers who stick to themselves or 2) regular commuters who have made aquaintances or friends from their regular commute </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many have the appearance of passing time by reading their devices, looking through the paper, or appearing to be listening to music (or some audio) </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Commuters often have their hands full - one hand grasping a cup of coffee, while the other is holding their bags or items required for the day/journey </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">These folks know their destination - they queue up for the train (somehow, there must be an invisible line because they know where the train door will stop) and they are quick to get from one platform to another to make a connection </span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">So, what's applicable? Well, some examples:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A couple of people had their hands full, and had to put everything on the ground, while typing on her device: how can we get them the information they need without them using their hands? </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">One photo has a man reading on his BlackBerry smartphone, with his glasses above his head (for seeing far): how can we get them information they need easier (without relying on perfect vision)? </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">One traveller was making a phone call on a payphone, while consulting his mobile phone (perhaps he's trying to avoid roaming fees?) </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A couple commuters had a smartphone but a separate audio device: better service integration and education/awareness of them? </span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Maybe next time, if you're stuck in a rut, look around you for inspiration. Who knows where that will take you!</span>
