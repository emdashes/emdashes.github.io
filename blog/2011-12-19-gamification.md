<span style="font-weight: 400;">One Thursday evening, a few of us attended a talk at the University of Waterloo Stratford campus, which had this description:</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Digital Media Series: Gamification. Public lecture by Games Institute director Neil Randall on what gamification is and how it is affecting the world in terms of marketing, buying decisions and just plain fun.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The description intrigued me since I like playing some games (</span><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German-style_board_game"><span style="font-weight: 400;">euro board games</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> like Carcassone, Ticket to Ride) and while the </span><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamification"><span style="font-weight: 400;">concept of gamification</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> isn't new to me, I wanted to learn more about this trend and the appeal of it. I first came across it at UX Week back in August: a whole workshop on "gamestorming" was offered, but I chose to attend the one on seductive interaction design instead, which actually included concepts from behavioral economics, neuroscience, game mechanics, and rhetoric.</span>
<h2><b>What's gamification?</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Randall defines it  as applying game mechanics or structures to traditionally non-game artifacts, with the goal of user engagement as an end result. These could include the use of:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reward systems </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Social status </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Competition </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Achievement </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Incentives </span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Examples are all around, from non-web models such as grocery or purchasing reward points (e.g. Shoppers Optimum Points, with points worth a different value depending on the level) to web-based models such as discussion forums (some having points or titles depending on the number of posts and helpful solutions). I'm sure you can think of other examples where some have used it well and some examples of products that might need some work.</span>
<h2><b>Why should we be interested in gamification?</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">We were reminded that it's not only about user experience, but it's about engagement.That is, a site or a product could be perfectly usable, but if users aren't engaged, they might not come back - the product or site isn't "sticky" enough (as was the case for Twitter: they found that people signed up but often would not come back because they didn't understand the value of twitter at first). One of the hardest design challenges for a successful product, especially a website, is to give the user something to care about.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Games engage most people, and one of the most core elements in the gaming world is discovery. The appeal of games is that they put players in a situation where it has rare real world consequences (so if you choose or not choose to play the game, it shouldn't harm you).</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We heard surprising stats which noted that </span><a href="http://www.theesa.com/facts/pdfs/ESA_EF_2011.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">an industry report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> indicated that in 2010, 42% of computer/video game players were women, which was a change in demographics, with most of them being 30 to 55 years old (think Angry Birds or Farmville).</span>
<h2><b>What are the building blocks of gamification?</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Building blocks of gamification could consist of (some mentioned above in the examples):</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Points: something visible people can get </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Levels: sometimes, the first few levels can be completed easily, but progress takes longer in the upper levels </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trophies, badges, achievements (e.g. Scouts or Foursquare) </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virtual goods </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Leaderboards </span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">And they tend to satisfy our desires for:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reward </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Status </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Achievement </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Self-expression </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Competition </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Altruism</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><b>The catch?</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Like most things in life, there is a warning. Some people won't like it, and some people still won't care. Some say that the use of games in a business concept threatens the joy of real games. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">But if it does work, don't abuse it as some users might not come back if they're perceiving that you're using game mechanics for concealment or coercion. Designers might label this as "</span><a href="http://wiki.darkpatterns.org/Home"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dark Patterns</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">" - using interface elements designed to trick people. We need to remember what was said to Spider-Man: "With great power comes great responsibility."</span>
<h2><b>Recommendation</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Randall concluded the talk by saying that games shouldn't be grafted into the product (on the side as an option), but instead should be central to the interaction; players thus learn to play and to play increasingly well.</span>
