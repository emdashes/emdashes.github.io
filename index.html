				I have been mentoring and praying for a new grad who has been trying to start her career in UX. One evening, during my time catching up on my Bible reading and praying, I felt God telling (not really with a voice, more like a nudging feeling) that maybe by having left (which was a tough decision for me), it created an opportunity for my friend. Sure, a new role may have eventually been posted, but the timing was probably expedited by another coworker’s subsequent departure as well. All along her hiring process, we both patiently waited – her for news, and I to see how the story unfolded! I couldn’t say with certainty, “hey, God told me you’ll get the job – you’ll see” even after seeing that it wasn’t the right fit for two other applicants who interviewed as well (yes, I knew those people too – so it felt like I was just watching a movie as the outside perspective looking in).


<p class="has-background has-very-light-gray-background-color">This verse holds true time and time again: <br><em>“Trust in the LORD with all your heart and lean not on your understanding; in all your ways, acknowledge Him and He will make your path straight.”  Proverbs 3:5-6</em></p>


<p>Now I’m intrigued at what’s in store for me next – so far, I didn’t really actively apply to any role -they all sort of happened (update: with the exception of this latest one – and God turned a “not possible” to an offer!). There <del>are</del>were a couple of possibilities I’m praying through, but at this point, I have the luxury of not having to worry about experience on my resume as much or needing to rely on my income to meet my family’s needs.</p>


<hr><p>In the past year, more people have asked me how I got into UX (user experience). I’ve told a version of my story to a few people, but it’s really all God – really, it’s been great!  路  Let’s go back in time…<br></p>


<p class="has-drop-cap">So my first visit to the optometrist in Grade 9 changed my life. After seeing Dr. Stephanie, I was determined to become an optometrist, to help improve people’s lives by helping them to see better (perhaps this explains I had kept a colouring book (by Unicef?) around that talked about a possum who went to developing countries to help those with cataracts see again). Research skills kicked in soon after and my academic and career path was set for Waterloo (the only optometry school in Canada that is taught in English; McGill being the other), or so I thought.</p>


<p>I had 3.5 years to prepare myself, my family, and my friends that I was moving to a brand new province, without really knowing anyone there. Well, except I had met the English pastor at the local Chinese church at a conference in Regina a couple years earlier, who had then told me nope, I wasn’t going to make it into Optometry (of course, I didn’t listen to a stranger’s assessment of me!). </p>


<p class="has-drop-cap">Eventually however, I ditched optometry in favour of RPW (rhetoric professional writing), <a href="https://her.happyhippos.ca/2006/01/1999-2000-year-two/">switching with relative ease</a>. A friend once astutely pointed out that the seeing metaphor is a theme that carries through this story.  I wanted to become a technical writer; I wanted to write documentation in a way that would be easily understood, and change the way people saw manuals, instead of boring, hard-to-understand, and something to read/consult only as a last resort (to fix a mistake). A couple of courses in information design toward the end of my degree really piqued my interest in UX. I ended up as a technical writer, marketing writer, and finally as a internet content writer (which overlaps with UX writing these days), before I ended up exploring the user researcher vs. interaction designer path. But while I expressed interest in interaction design, I wasn’t given a UX role until another leader in a different department randomly offered me an opportunity as a project coordinator. Yes, all of this happened by “accident”!</p>


<p class="has-background has-very-light-gray-background-color">Looking back, it seems like I’ve been interested in UX before the term became popular. And since I don’t believe in coincidences, I see God’s timing and hand in everything!</p>


<p>Almost 9 years later, I was essentially laid off at the beginning of my maternity leave (they cut my team and position but generously retained me until my mat leave was over). I had intended to quit to be a full-time parent at the end of it anyway, but here was God showing up again, and giving me a really awesome gift: the gift of a year’s worth of continued benefits and little extra cash to start a new chapter of life.</p>


<p class="has-text-color has-background has-very-dark-gray-color has-very-light-gray-background-color">One day, my friend sent me this message, “Would you be interested in ux design work?” My response, “part-time definitely!”</p>


<p class="has-drop-cap">Expecting that it was the end of my career (I called it career suicide) when I became a stay-at-home parent, God had other plans when I wasn’t looking, and gave me a part-time contract in UX that I did mostly remote, with the occasional on-site visit. Contract work became relevant work, because shortly after that, a friend reached out to me (above). I actually expected a no as I’ve come to expect that local tech companies want someone full-time. But, this <a href="https://her.happyhippos.ca/2017/12/wrapping-up-2017/">kick-started a whole new adventure</a>! </p>


<p>Within a very short time, I slapped together a (terrible) portfolio that was graciously reviewed by a friend who had more experience, recognized the design challenge as being one I had reviewed in detail on the internet prior, but feeling like I didn’t complete fully complete it and thought I failed the interview, and then somehow ended up with my ideal during-school-hours schedule (with a few full-days here and there) doing interesting work!</p>


<p class="has-background has-very-light-gray-background-color">During my interview before I was hired, I asked what a successful or effective UX Designer would look like in the role, and the answers were “user research”, “testing”, “validation”, “success metrics”; so, it’s hardly a surprise that I ended up doing 80% UX research (practice and strategy) and 20% UX design there.</p>


<p>At the start of this year, a bunch of things happened at work, which led to some restructuring and my role changed: 80% of what I was hired to do was taken away. And because I’m huge on the U in UX, it wasn’t the right fit anymore so I eventually decided to leave. Actually, I surprised myself, because I’m usually not one to quit that easily, but it was oddly freeing, and it was good timing, really good timing – I was able to spend the next few weeks with my sister and her family, and vacation in Orlando after that! Seeing and being on God’s path is pretty amazing 🙂</p>

				Six months ago, our littlest had an IgE blood test: one nurse took his blood, the other stood by in case he needed to pin him down. I covered my son’s eyes, she took blood; he flinched at the poke, didn’t move until it was done and when asked by the nurse if it hurt, he answered, “nope,” and looked at them as if to say, “what, is it supposed to hurt?” Turns out, he did far better than some adults they’ve seen.


<p>The report came back, and it was negative for milk, which suggested that  his chance of having an anaphylactic / severe allergic reaction to dairy was less than 25%. I was hopeful! After all, he had some accidental encounters with dairy a handful of times without severe reaction, but there’s the rub – his skin didn’t do as well, and reacted with the milk with the skin prick test . And, this is why you can’t rely on a blood test alone; that’s why an allergist has to consider the history of and individual (how they’ve responded to the allergen in the past) with a combination of tells before making a diagnosis.</p>


<p>When he finally weaned this summer, I happily jumped on the dairy bandwagon again – with a grilled cheese sandwich as the dairy product that I wanted to celebrate with first. Sadly, it was a variant of a jalapeno popper that wasn’t as satisfying as a grilled cheese would have been. A few weeks later, I noticed that the skin around my neck was starting to get red, patchy, and quite itchy at times; I’ve only had eczema around my neck once, and it was during my academic years, so I had figured it was stress induced.</p>


<p>Yet, it seemed to get better when I limited my dairy intake, but flared up again when I  threw caution to the wind over the holidays. I suspect it just might be my body responding to the reintroduction to dairy as some foreign matter. The allergist, in brief conversation, asked me if I was allergic to milk as a child. Why yes, I had recently discovered that while I knew my mother didn’t know I was allergic to milk until much later — even though I was vomiting after having any, I didn’t realize that the doctor didn’t suggest this to her until I was almost 3 years old! (that might explain why I don’t like milk now, even though I like many other dairy products). </p>


<p>I expect that if a naturopath confirmed my food sensitivities, she might recommend avoiding the foods that trigger an autoimmune response. Yet, the allergist recommended that if it was only a skin response, that I shouldn’t eliminate it completely, because he had found in his experience that if children cut out the foods in their diet, and then came into exposure with it down the road, the reaction ends up being a lot worse than before. This is what I wanted to hear, I suppose, because that means I can still have dairy – but perhaps in moderation.  My family doctor suspects it’s all related to the chronic skin conditions that I have elsewhere on my body, but I suppose one can never really know; all I know is that the skin is just a visible sign that something is awry with your autoimmune system – it might be your gut, might be something else inside</p>


<p>The allergist has given the green light to proceed with the oral challenge with the littlest next month, but in a hospital setting in case he needs treatment, so here’s to hoping …and praying – God knows what He’s doing!<br></p>

(this point is especially meaningful because feeling like I belong is important to me, and God knew all this time – a good topic for a future reflective post)</li><li>On top of that, j.w has been playing pickleball with the bride’s father for the past few months without realizing the connection.</li><li>I had known that the bride’s family was “Mennonite from Ayr”; I did not connect “Mennonite Bretheren”with “Mennonite”. Upon finding this out, my aunt asked me if we were Mennonite, and I said no, we’re not Mennonite – it was really hard to explain, but I guess she might have understood it better if I made the comparison of going to a Catholic church without actually being Catholic, or a Chinese church without being Chinese.</li>I had expected going to the wedding knowing only my cousins and the family, but it turned out, we knew a table of other guests and had a connection to both sides of the family; what a delight and such a joy to celebrate with and to get to know both sides a bit better! Only God could’ve made this possible, and He’s not done… 🙂 ]]>			</div>

				Another year has flown by and has it been one of growing: <p>We’ve had the joy to watch Little Brother be a part of the family, and influencing his sister to creatively explore boundaries (Bean’s thinking: what? the mattress can be a bouncy castle? and the couch seats can come apart and be a landing mat? Let’s do it!).</p> <p>Language literacy: from broken English at the start of the year to full-on conversations with his sister in English (almost) all the time, which is way too much – but as Bean observed, the parents speak to each other in English all the time as well. He surprised me when he verbally counted to 10 in both French and Spanish as well; I’m also surprised that he manages to get through an hour of weekly Cantonese classes!</p><p>I credit his recognition of numbers from 1-8 to the numbers of the trains, and his colour-recognition also to Thomas. We’ve</p> also seen his keen interest in music and singing (but not others singing while he’s singing), and in storytime and books. I especially cherish the times, when he says sorry and means it (he also smart about saying sorry to get out of trouble) and at meal times, particularly when he is enjoying his food, he asks who made it and thanks the person who did! <p>Motor skills: from falling down stairs to mastering riding a tricycle; from solving puzzles patiently to picking up art activities like colouring (scribbling) and playdough; from playing with his trains – Thomas, to zooming around with Lighting McQueen and his Hot Wheels cars and car wash garage station, and firetrucks; from taking off his clothes by himself to putting on his shirt, jacket (and zipping), socks, and boots by himself.</p> <p>Pretend play and following his sister: it’s really confusing when they’re addressing each other around us as he’s the baby and she’s the mommy/mama. But, it’s so endearing when they get along and act in their assigned roles – him being so forgiving without seeming to mind that she’s bossing him around for the most part. Though he’s a preschooler, he’s truly still the baby when it comes to falling asleep and sleeping independently.</p> <p>This upcoming year will our last with him before he enters school; I think he’ll be ready when September rolls along!</p>]]>			</div>

				When you ask Little Brother how old he is, he holds up two fingers, and confidently says, “Three!” While I find myself correcting him almost every time, mathematically, I suppose he isn’t incorrect.


<p>At the age he is at now, he’s starting to identify colours (or colors, for my American friends). He knows “black” and “wipe” (white), and maybe he knows the others too, but when you ask him what shirt he’s wearing, or what colour Daddy is wearing today, he might respond with “Thomas!”, “Percy!”, or “James!”. Some days, he might mention Emily or Stephen / Rocket too. It just so happens, those are the colours of  Thomas the train and friends; so, I suppose he isn’t incorrect.</p>


<p class="has-background has-very-light-gray-background-color">I’ve come to realize that although Bean doesn’t often show affection towards people, she deeply cares and loves her little brother. This side of her shows when we are trying to threaten him or put him in time out, she pleas that we don’t carry through (“I don’t want him to go to the hospital” or “don’t leave him!”) or wants to follow him into time out and be with him. So, in case you missed it – because I almost did: her favourite colour is no longer green, but currently, “Thomas”; I think his is James – because she has designated the red train in our set for him. He likes trains, so now, she does too.</p>

				I recently re-joined the dairy (and nut) wagon, officially marking the end of a temporary journey in being certain nuts and dairy free. When j.w asked me which food I would try first when I got here, I decided on a grilled cheese sandwich.


<p>Turns out, it was a jalapeno munchie from the Fish Hut. And the next day, I tried adding a tad of cream in my coffee as I enjoyed it before, but the cream ruined it! The coffee the tasted so…well, <em>creamy</em>.</p>


<p>Throughout the week, I’ve been having other things that have dairy in it, such as a piece of Tim Horton’s donuts, shared by co-workers (not worth it), Marble Slab ice cream (sadly, it melted far too quickly), and a Matter of Taste cappuccino. The velvety smooth foam of the cappuccino – that is definitely something I’ve missed; soy or almond milk cappuccinos just aren’t the same. Yet, by the time I got to the bottom of it when it had cooled down, it was again, too <em>creamy. </em>Sigh.</p>


<p>And, yes, pizza with real cheese is so much better than vegan “cheese” – I especially enjoy the stringiness of the melted cheese! I also had my first slice of toasted cheese bread that I had stored in the deep-freezer a few months ago. This also means, I can probably defrost the banana bread (containing milk products) that a church friend brought over from Stone Crock and make a batch of Monk Chocolate hot chocolate too!</p>


<p>The best of it was matcha ice cream in the hojicha milk float from Tsujiri. I switched with j.w because the matcha latte I got tasted too <em>creamy</em><em>.</em></p>

		<p>				for. a. gaming. convention. Yup. I tell people that I had thought we were doing Chicago paired with this (as it’s on my roadtrip list), but it turned out to be only this. And, in hindsight, probably wise that it was only this, as this was a spending vacation, and by the end of it, we ended taking home some new games, some promo packs, enamel pins, and a few litres of local beer.
Gaming seems to have become more popular over the last few years. Case in point: I spent more time at the convention <a href="http://her.happyhippos.ca/2010/08/indianapolis/">than the first time,</a> the US border guard actually plays Magic: The Gathering (he asked what j.w thought about Core 19), and our server at Payne’s in Gas City plays Pokémon GO.

This year, because we were at an airbnb that was almost a 40-minute walk away, we decided we needed to get there between 7-8am to get a spot at the Circle Center Mall garage, which was a few dollars less than neighbouring parking garages. This meant that I woke up too early every day and walked over 20K steps the first two days (when my average is usually between 7-10k) so by the time day 3 hit, I was quite exhausted by 10pm in addition to being tired in the mornings. This also meant that while learning to play Roll for the Galaxy: Ambition (the expansion), I accidentally “rolled” my cup of coffee instead of my cup of dice. Gaaah.


</p><h3 id="firstHeading" class="firstHeading" lang="en">Pre-Gen Con</h3>


I got the most steps on Wednesday, likely from walking through the 100 Acres: The Virginia B. Fairbanks Art and Nature Park, Newfields, walking back to our car from kayaking along the canal, checking out the Stink (a pre-con meetup) to get some freebies and waiting in line for our badges.

I really enjoyed the walk in the park and interacting with the art installations mixed in with nature, like hovering rings and sloped yellow benches, but it was too bad that a few installations seem to have disappeared and the path around the lake was closed due to erosion. There was this one place called “<em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Park_of_Laments" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Park of Laments</a>” </em>and it was truly a fitting title as you had to enter a narrow tunnel surrounded by two walls of rocks to get to an enclosed park area where it was essentially a dead end. A less depressing piece titled, <em>“<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Funky_Bones" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Funky Bones</a>” </em> actually had me humming, “these dry bones, these dry bones…”  (from what lyrics / songs I don’t know, but they’re a reference to Ezekiel 37:1-14).
I’m glad that we finally got to visit the park since it was on a my to-do list from last time, along with visiting the canal. Last time, I saw the surreys for rental on my way to the zoo, but I’m glad my friend (another j.w!) was willing to do tandem kayaking with me instead! I was a tad nervous as it was my first time in a kayak / canoe without a life jacket but when I asked about life jackets, the rental place said it was only 3 ft deep and comes up to the chest – and yes we were fine.

<h3>Food and Drinks</h3>


The food truck food around the convention centre was mediocre at best this year, but here were some unexpected finds:

<li>Bee coffee roasters across the street from the convention.

<li>Tried fresh yellow (or was it blue) oyster mushroom from the 4-minute drive to Wildwood Market from our 1st Airbnb. That market had some neat local food choices so I made dinner on the first night with local ingredients: fungi, yellow cherry tomatoes, and some snow peas.

<li>Rio Grande shared their hot catered food with whomever was there, so we happened to be around for a breakfast and a couple of mid-day / later-evening meals. They had the BEST prime rib – coffee rubbed and marbled and cooked just right with an abundance of (much needed) vegetables and potatoes; this was easily our favourite meal (and a second dinner, after having some bar bites at Weber Grill earlier).</li>

Except he had them all…[/caption]
j.w took a break with me to check out the Indiana State Fair on Friday night, as I had wanted to see the hot air balloon parade, but due to winds, they couldn’t inflate so it was cancelled 🙁  Well, at least we saw a tractor parade, which was different than any parade I’ve seen. We also spent a lot on fair food anyway: a revisit of deep-fried butter (turns out that they have been around for over 20 years), deep-fried bacon (tasted like bacon that spent extra time in the pan, but the seasoning and not being too salty was great!), had a garbage burger again (pulled pork on top of pork patty – and yes, that’s what it’s called), and stumbled into the barn with Indy brews! We tried the mead and the blood orange IPA that was in the competition and we liked the latter so much that we headed straight for <a href="https://www.centerpointbrewing.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Centerpoint Brewing</a> right after. The bartender was super nice and let us sample a bunch (complimentary tasting) before we decidedly bought 2 6-packs of the IPA and a growler of the <a href="https://www.centerpointbrewing.com/beers-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Center Perk</a> (coffee stout). Here’s where he gets extra points: he remembers us on Sunday and welcomes us back, and when he learns our growler exploded in the car (which now smells of coffee and beer), he offers us another on the house [ref] Unfortunately, bad news: the limited run coffee stout was out so we would have to choose another. Sigh[/ref]

</ul><h3>Accommodations</h3>


We decided to go to Gen Con fairly last minute (a few months before) so instead of hotels we went with Airbnb. Usually, if you want nearby accommodations, you go and book it a year before. We did get a chance to see that the Crowne Plaza Union Station had actual rooms in train cars while we were there! They converted an old rail station to a hotel.

We spent the first two nights in a refurbished house that smelled like stale cigarette smoke, with all the basic essentials – the neighbourhood looked more run down though with empty stores and 4 police cruisers and two on the ground in handcuffs just on the corner of our street.  The host had add some thoughtful touches such as leaving a bag of some local coffee (Tinker Coffee Co.), some emergency toiletries, and it was almost 5x cheaper for a much bigger space. Conversely, our last-minute booking during Gen Con days meant premium pricing everywhere – and the host was smart enough to leave town and rent out her unit in addition to the one she normally rents out in the same suite. I loved the stay at the smaller space – the decor, the comfortable linen and beds, the hair and body wash…and even the pool was suitable to use at night!

		<p>				Gen Con: Thursday through Sunday


I started off my first day of Gen Con with two non-gaming mini workshops on the art and method of zentangle; everyone else stormed the exhibit hall when it opened. I had a great time doodling with a purpose! The rest of the day, I strolled through the exhibit hall collecting freebies, browsing the booths, and demoing a couple of short games.
Other than me joining the audience to watch an interview with the puppeteer and voice of Big Bird and Oscar the Grouch (who knew that they were played by the same person!) and his wife [ref] – there was an entire puppet stream / track at this convention, and the puppeteer and voice for Kermit the frog and Ernie (both played by the same person) was also there which I missed! [/ref], for the next couple of days, j.w and I spent most of our time together to look around the hall and demo games (at the hall and CGE/Rio Grande rooms); I found myself playing more games when with another person around than on my own.

We stopped for a bit to see the cosplay contest for the first time as we missed out on the parade as our True Dungeon game took longer than expected – wow, some people are truly dedicated at hand making their costume!


<h3>Games</h3>




<h4>Notes for next time</h4>




<ul><li>the C n C booth resells Rio Grande games; you can bargain with them.</li>


    

<li>Cool stuff inc has a dings and dents (or last stock) shelf that they restock throughout the convention. You can also use the $2 off coupon in the coupon book with these games.</li>


</ul><h4>I would consider buying or playing again</h4>

<ul><li><a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/257527/trapwords" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Trapwords</strong></a> (coming out in the Fall sometime) – advanced taboo, best played with people you know</li>


    

<li><strong><a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgameexpansion/233891/ticket-ride-map-collection-volume-6-france-old-wes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ticket to Ride: France</a></strong>: the tracks aren’t colored ahead of time, so you use one action to assign a color <i>but</i> your opponents could claim it before you do!</li>


    

<li><strong>Roll for the Galaxy: Ambition</strong>: extra cards and goals to complete. I regret not picking this one up at $23 – $2 at the dents and dings shelf at Cool Stuff Inc. because I wasn’t sure how it would play and didn’t know its retail price (later found out it sold elsewhere at the convention for $40). If they reminded me of the $2 off coupon, I would’ve picked it up. Though, pro-tip, don’t do as I did: don’t play and drink for you might roll your drink cup (filled with coffee in my case) instead of your dice cup. Though now that I know Amazon.com has it for $24, thanks to someone telling me about <a href="http://boardgameprices.com">boardgameprices.com</a> at the consignment store, I don’t feel as regretful.</li>


    

<li><strong>King Domino: Age of Giants</strong> (expansion)</li>


    

<li><strong>drop it</strong>: quick game to play, can play with kids, but hard to master, but would only get it if it was on sale, as the sticker price was $30 USD</li>


    

<li><strong>Cities of Splendor</strong>: adds a bunch of expansion games to Splendor, but would only buy this if we get a copy of Splendor. We’ve been playing Splendor on our phones / tablet after a friend taught us how to play, but the feel of the game is nice</li>


    

<li><strong>Word slam</strong>: A team vs. team game where you use existing word cards to try to and get your teammates to guess the correct word without using any gestures or your voice. It seemed to get a bit repetitive after a few rounds, but I like word games, so I’d be willing to give this one another try.</li>


</ul><h4>Did not get a chance to try</h4>




<ul><li><strong>Queen Domino</strong></li>


    

<li><strong>King Domino: Age of Giants</strong> (expansion)</li>


    

<li><strong>Terraforming Mars</strong>: I heard it has a Race for the Galaxy feel to it!</li>


    

<li><strong><a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/244330/scarabya" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Scarabya</a></strong><a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/244330/scarabya" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> – by Blue Orange, the same publisher and designer of King Domino.</a> I did meet the game designer in person, and it was sort of interesting to see that everyone at the booth was from France except for one American, even though they have an office in Silicon Valley.</li>


    

<li><strong>trash pandas</strong>: I only found this intriguing because I like the art of Sushi Go and the others at the Gamewright booth like this one looked cute, and was sold out on the first day.</li>


</ul><h4>Games I tried that I probably wouldn’t pay money for</h4>




<ul><li><strong>Catan VR</strong> (needs an Oculus set first)</li>


    

<li><strong>Small World: Sky Island</strong> (too many pieces! would be more fun to play on a tablet or smartphone)</li>


    

<li>Other expansions of Dominion (too many cards! but fun to play anyway)</li>


    

<li>Escape-room type card games. I feel like these are one-time plays and thus a waste of resources</li>


    

<li><a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/141791/pinata" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Pinata</strong></a>: a two-player game that seems kid-friendly but gets really repetitive quickly (maybe that’s why it’s perfect for a mother-daughter game); the consignment store had it for $12</li>


    

<li><strong>Chicken Cha Cha Cha</strong>: relies on a lot of memory – great for a younger audience</li>


    

<li><strong>Codenames: Duet</strong> – is a fun game but the group game seems more fun</li>


    

<li><strong>True Dungeon</strong> (TD): when j.w played it the first time, he came home raving about it. I think with the rise of escape rooms, I’d rather spend my money there (works out to be around the same price per hour). TD was a RPG/D&D+Escape room hybrid: you’re in the dark going from space to space with divider walls draped with fabric to match the theme to separate the rooms; there’s a dungeon/game master in each room that yells out scenarios and penalties and then some random actors dressed up in themed costumes. I randomly died in the middle of the game (turned into stone after a low die roll), which mean I couldn’t participate in 3 out of 6 or 7 rooms, so I feel like I got ripped off somewhat.I felt like there was little to no onboarding for new players (had no idea what happened, and when to dock myself life). At the beginning, we spent a considerable time trying to figure out what our given random tokens meant and how to suit up our character by trading our tokens with others as each one had a special ability or armour/weapon. I wish they explained it better that certain tokens are more valuable than others, such as the purple ones, which are ultra rare (1 in every 100 packs), so you don’t trade them away. Thankfully, j.w had played before so he pocketed the purple one that I had opened (instead of giving or trading it away) and later found out that it sold for $75, but the buy price was $35, so I guess we got back most of my game. At least I contributed to solving a puzzle fairly quickly before our time was up.</li>


</ul><h4>Games we bought</h4>

<ol><li><strong><a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/98229/pictomania" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pictomania</a></strong>, newest edition (surprised that it was j.w who wanted a copy because it’s a group game and you have to draw!) – a hybrid of pictionary and speed where everyone in the game participates at the same time.</li>


    

<li><strong><a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/28620/phoenicia" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Phoenicia</a></strong> – by the same designer as Race for the Galaxy. Hadn’t heard of it – only picked up because it was $10 at the consignment store [ref] future note to self: every day a board game stays at the consignment store, it drops in price[/ref]</li>


    

<li><strong>Pressure Cooker</strong> – from Rio Grande, looks like Overcooked and for $10, it’s worth the try
[caption id="" align="alignright" width="680"]<img class="size-medium" src="https://geekandsundry.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/everdell.png" width="680" height="582"> Image from <a href="https://geekandsundry.com/build-your-new-home-with-critters-and-cards-in-everdell/">https://geekandsundry.com/build-your-new-home-with-critters-and-cards-in-everdell/</a>[/caption]</li>


    

<li><a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/199792/everdell" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Everdell</strong></a> – definitely my favourite game from our purchases. I hadn’t heard of this kickstarter game until we passed by the booth on the last day. The artwork was what drew me in first as it reminded me of why I read some graphic novels, then phrases like tableau building, worker resource placement, Race for the Galaxy meets 7 Wonders / Agricola were the right words to hear. This was a game I was willing to pay a lot of money for! The designer, James Wilson, and his wife was there explaining the game and signing the collector’s edition. I learned that they’re from Idaho and Gen Con was their first big-city experience. He does embroidery printing as his day job, and that he’s worked on this game for over 5 years now. They had hoped to sell 100 copies at this convention, but they had sold over 1000 copies by Sunday morning! (so far, I have yet to win a game though 🙁 )</li>


    

<li><strong>Race for the Galaxy: Xeno Wars</strong> – turns out we already have this expansion, but we hadn’t gotten around to playing with the extra pieces yet, so I didn’t recognize the cards (but found the box to be very familiar – and that was why)</li>


    

<li><strong>Robits</strong> – a kid-friendly $3 game for $1 because we had a $2 off coupon</li>


</ol>

		<p>				the government also gave extra funding to daycare centres, so that parents end up saving a few dollars a day! So lesson is, do your research when comparing home daycare and daycare centres. I’m sad that they didn’t extend it to licensed home childcare providers, since the region keeps trying to recruit people to either open up a licensed home daycare <em>or</em> send their children into licensed home daycare.


</p><hr>
When we were looking for child care late last year, we signed up for the region’s “OneList” – which is essentially a one-stop shop for licensed childcare options. At the time, I had place my child’s name into home child-care providers in addition to a waitlist of daycare centres close by. Well, 6 months later, a few spots opened up in the daycare centres and initially, it seemed like the cost was between $10-15 more a day to have a child in a daycare centre. When we visited one, I felt like it was pretty chaotic (and overwhelming), with 1 adult to 8 kids in a pretty tight space. I had pretty much written off that option until a recent visit to another daycare centre changed my mind because:


<ol><li>Even though they both belonged to the same organization, the space felt so much more open, with a big room and high ceilings and a shaded outdoor natural area for play. And, because this daycare centre isn’t attached to a school, you don’t get school aged kids going, which makes it seem less crazy, maybe?</li>


    

<li>This daycare centre doesn’t bill for stat holidays, Christmas week, and you get an additional two weeks unbilled. Home daycares bill year round, unless the caregiver cannot provide care for that day.</li>


    

<li>With the bonus unbilled days and the extra funding from the government that brought daycare costs down by a couple of dollars a day, it seems like it’s cheaper to send my child to one day of daycare than to keep him in home childcare full-time! (numbers below are approximate)</li>

While the cost differential isn’t very significant per year for us (though every dollar might count for a family with a tighter budget), we made the switch part-time as we felt our child might benefit from going to a more “school-like” program (closer to the kindergarten learning model) since he’ll be going to school (far too) soon. However, I’m not ready to give up <a href="https://www.sapcrc.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the PCRC</a> and our caregiver yet, so hopefully this will work out.]]>

Because the resort had a really kid-friendly pools / water play area and some decent free activities to do in the mornings (like kinetic sand play), the kids spent non<span style="font-size: 1rem; background-color: transparent;">-rainy times in the pool; I even found the water-slide quite safe for non-swimmers like myself!</span>

A social commentary on what we’re seeing more and more: the couple on the left were interacting with their phones while enjoying their drinks instead of chatting with each other[/caption]
And when they were out of the pool, we attempted to play mini-golf but didn’t actually get through a game because of the poor weather. The resort also had a nice little gated play structure for kids to play on as well, which was under utilized and therefore great when Bean went on to play while her brother was napping back in the room.
One unexpected activity that everyone took part in at around 830 AM in the morning was the false fire alarm, so everyone evacuated with bed head and sleepy eyes. Thankfully, it happened at 830 and not 3AM in the morning, and it wasn’t raining.

Before we left, our friend told us about a family membership at a science centre in BC with reciprocal memberships in Canada and around the world that you could buy online – and for 3 years, it didn’t even cost as much as 1 year at our local museum (which isn’t as great as the ones we’ve explored so far).  The caveat is that you can’t use it within 90 mile radius of your address and within 90 miles around the centre you bought it from, which means we can still visit Science World but not the Toronto Science Centre or London Children’s Museum with this membership. Seeing that we will likely make a visit to BC and Washington State in the next 3 years, we will definitely try to make sure to use this membership to visit Science World and the flight museum and the children’s museum in Everett!
Anyway, we used this newly bought membership at Orlando Science Center and drove a little ways out (to sunnier and warmer weather) to Tampa Children’s Museum and spent two afternoons indoors, in air conditioning and sheltered by the rain. The kids seemed to have a great time, and I enjoyed going through the two places as well – my favourites were seeing the glee at the silk vacuüm tube in the Science Center and the sand sensory table (made possible by a kinect and a projector!) and the mesh climber at the Children’s Museum.


<h3>Shopping areas</h3>

We also spent some time at the Florida Mall play spaces and walking around and taking the short ferry taxi around Disney Springs (and digging in the dino pit at T-Rex Cafe). For date night, j.w and I went back to Disney Springs to try a VR experience where you walk from room to room immersed in a Star Wars shooting adventure with Oculus packs. It was $30 for about 30 minutes, which I feel is a little steep but I think it was worth the experience. This time, I stopped in at Basin because I read online that you could get soap ends at a discount, and while they aren’t completely natural (though they do have a natural line), the soap bars look too cool and smell edible – they remind of Fimo tubes encased in glycerin; the Mickey ear silhouettes looked the most fitting!


<h3>Food</h3>




<h4>Repeats</h4>


We went back to the Southern BBQ place at Disney Springs, as well as Q’nenans. To my surprise, the FoH manager recognized us and welcomed us back! And then they threw in some chicken avocado mix when we just ordered the bread on the side; talk about excellent customer service! We also returned to Sweet Tomatoes twice, as the kids seemed to eat well there and the prices are very reasonable, especially with the buy $50 get $10 promo combined with a 25% off coupon – we found out that the prices actually vary depending on location, and the one in Tampa seems quieter and even cheaper than the one in Orlando (~$12 for soup-salad bar dinner).
This time, at Disney Springs, I found a allergen-friendly bakery, but I forgot that I usually find the texture of gluten-free baked goods to be a bit off. Sadly, I also found their loaf cake / tea cake to be overly sweet and not moist enough.


<h4>Fish</h4>

We also tried sushi on a belt at Florida Mall [ref] – this brought me back to high school or early university days when we went to eat at Metrotown / Metropolis which had a restaurant with this concept; it didn’t seem to stick around for very long [/ref], which the kids loved, and the pricing wasn’t too bad for the quality; you just had to know what to order so you wouldn’t be paying too much in the end. On the last day, we also went to a really good poke bowl place, with huge portions for a really reasonable price; it outshines any poke bowl places I’ve had outside of Hawaii so far.


<h4>And more…</h4>

j.w’s coworker recommended an Asian fusion burritos place, which she said was “life-changing” but I found it super slow (he explained as I was paying that a cook had walked out mid-shift) and it was quite salty, so it’s not on my list of returns. However, j.w’s cousin’s recommendation of Tasty Wok on Imperial / Asian street was quite authentic, despite the “steam table concept” name. Speaking of “steamed table” / hot foods table, in Buffalo, we stopped at Wegmans for dinner, and their battered fish was really crispy and just really good, except when I went back to get more, they were closing their food offering and had taken any left away 🙁 What was really nice was that this Wegmans had a jazz trio playing and a relatively large kids’ play area / corner so you could enjoy your food with live music and watch your kids playing, all for free [ref] plus they also stocked free diapers for emergencies including pampers pull-ups in their washrooms[/ref]!
