								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				Among the many neat themes, tools, and plug-ins that WordPress offers, they sent me an &#8220;annual report&#8221; of what happened with my blog in 2013.<br />
<a href="http://jetpack.me/annual-report/47004674/2013/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-3747" alt="annualreport13" src="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/annualreport13-252x300.png" width="252" height="300" /></a><br />
After scrolling through everything, here&#8217;s what caught my eye:</p>
<ol>
<li>Facebook is my top referer (through sharing individual posts to my friends on Facebook)</li>
<li>I&#8217;m not sure if I&#8217;ve discouraged search engines to index my site since the start, but it&#8217;s somewhat strange to see that the top search referral is, &#8220;ntcbc deacon administrative leave&#8221; especially because I don&#8217;t have a post about that. And because I see it now, I guess there was an incident that must have been a big deal (bigger than I thought)</li>
<li>If we counted my top fans from commenters alone, Lawrence gets the award. But yes, I know that there are lurkers among you as well, so thanks <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="ðŸ™‚" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></li>
