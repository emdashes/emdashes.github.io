								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				<![CDATA[If you had suggested me to take two kids on a plane, by myself, I would have looked at you as if you were crazy, though I still might. But here I am, back from a trip to Vancouver and lived to tell that not only did we all survive, no crying tears were shed on the plane - and those of you who know our littlest, you probably remember that when he is left by himself for any period especially in an unfamiliar environment with unfamiliar faces, he starts to wail in no time, <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew+19%3A26&amp;version=ESV" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">but with God, <em><strong>all</strong></em> things are possible</a>!


<h3>Last minute trip</h3>


A few weeks ago, j.w found out that his company was sending him to Vegas. The initial plan was that we leave Bean with the grandparents for a few days while taking the baby with us. Except Vegas was 45C, feeling like 50C outside, and it isn&#8217;t exactly the most baby-friendly place. Plus, <a href="http://her.happyhippos.ca/2009/01/vegas/">I&#8217;ve been to Vegas before</a> and decided that being there once was enough.  So that left me with the option of staying home with the kids, in Toronto with the kids, or&#8230;I could pay an extra ticket and take all the kids with me to visit family in Vancouver; after all, Bean has been asking about when she could visit her cousin for months now &#8211; plus, I could help with kid-sitting since my mom&#8217;s sprained ankle wasn&#8217;t much better so she couldn&#8217;t take my sister&#8217;s kids. Turns out, my brother-in-law&#8217;s brother (does that make him brother-in-law too?) &#8211; who has no kids &#8211; was really awesome with the kids; they all loved him, and by the end of it, my crying boy loved him and Bean even chose him to drop us off at the airport &#8211;  over her aunt and grandma!  I could even leave him with 4 kids while I did dishes &#8211; made me think that maybe that&#8217;s what having an au pair feels like. We both concluded that <strong>two adults watching four kids is so much easier </strong>than one adult watching two, especially with the girls and boys being so close in age &#8211; the girls often went off giggling and up to no good, while the boys were okay in each others&#8217; company, even though they didn&#8217;t really play together much &#8211; other than around the train set. We also talked about how having more children at a home daycare is better because of this and you get paid more. Sleep was probably the biggest challenge, with him waking up at 5-6am the first few mornings, and having them sleep in on the two days that count: for church and the day of departure. Thankfully, with the two girls sleeping in one room, I didn&#8217;t really have to be with her although I felt bad that I often neglected her to try to put the youngest to sleep. My admiration for single parents have increased tenfold, especially if they don&#8217;t have any other family support around them to deal with sleep time, meals, meltdowns, and accidents. Trips out west generally feel really short even if it is longer than two weeks, but it seemed that 10 days was good enough this time &#8211; despite missed connections with old friends (we tried!); by the end, I felt I needed another vacation after this one.


<h3>On the plane</h3>


Speaking of departure, there&#8217;s nothing like hearing your name on the intercom at the airport along after the generic &#8220;final boarding call for flight xxxx  to Abbotsford; paging passengers L and W&#8221; that gets your legs going &#8211; while towing a preschooler in the car seat that&#8217;s strapped around the carry-on suitcase [ref]thanks to an idea from the internet &#8211; I saved $30 and used a non-weight tested luggage strap, carabiner and keychain ring, and the car seat tether instead &#8211; probably would be safer if I had used a weight-tested carabiner and O-ring instead [/ref] and carrying the baby in the ergo &#8211; and feeling sweaty by the time you settle into your seat on the plane. Thankfully, we were at the end of the second moving sidewalk already when I heard my name so it wasn&#8217;t too far for me to sprint there and wave, &#8220;we&#8217;re here &#8211; wait for me!&#8221;.
I don&#8217;t know what happened to the time, but we left church late, met with some traffic on the road, and of course, everything just takes longer with kids; thankfully, I had no luggage to check-in (another great thing about having cousins close in age and size). But by the time we were through the family line in security, I looked at one of the screens and noticed that there was only 15 mins left until departure so instead of taking the friendly security officer&#8217;s advice to wait for a golf cart (I did go there to see if a cart was around). Actually, everyone was super kind at security and on my flight &#8211; they let me take the baby through in the ergo and didn&#8217;t even scan it, and perhaps I was last on board, but they offered to take my (heavy 25lb+) suitcase and ended up stowing it overhead up front (I told them I didn&#8217;t need anything in it, so I would also be okay if they decided to check it) and carrying my car seat into our row, while I took care of the kids and the backpack. As we were settling into our row, one of the flight attendants strongly suggested to the passenger in our row to move to another row &#8211; back 10 rows! She politely declined, saying that she was fine, but with some prompting from the flight attendant saying that it would give us some wiggle room and that she wouldn&#8217;t be sitting beside anyone, she finally agreed, and I thanked her with relief. Had I known that there were empty rows, I would&#8217;ve volunteered to go back, but I had asked if it was a full flight, and the answer I got was that there were only a few seats here and there. So we got a whole row to ourselves, with was great, as it allowed the kids to spread out and take turns in the car seat and the other seat.

Unfortunately, Bean didn&#8217;t sleep at all (thus missing her nap) and little brother only got in a 30 minute nap at most both on the flight there and back. I do celebrate mini-successes though: on the first flight, I  did manage to transfer him into the car seat so that I could take her to the washroom. The second time she had to go, I picked a child-friendly show I had previously downloaded from Netflix on the iPad and gave him some snacks to munch on; alas, when I had to go the third time, he didn&#8217;t like it, so I took him with me. On the way back, he didn&#8217;t complain at all! Snacks (apple chips, <a href="https://broghies.com/whats-a-broghie/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">puffed rice crackers</a>, and baby food pouches, and the plane&#8217;s apple juice diluted with water) and new toys / activities (stickers, coloring, mini puzzles) kept them sane, but what worked on the 5 hr flight there didn&#8217;t work for the flight back &#8211; I only needed to take out 3 activities (1 for the boy) and the snacks for the short 3.5 hr flight back (wow, that&#8217;s some tail wind!), perhaps because the Dreamliner had the in-flight entertainment console (minus the sound &#8211; didn&#8217;t bother with earbuds), and the really cool shade button that adjusts the brightness and darkness of the passenger window pane. While we only got two seats to share among the three of us, it seemed more spacious than the Air Canada Rouge plane to Abbotsford &#8211; roomy enough for the boy to nap on my lap (again, for less than 30 minutes because he woke up upon transfer when Bean needed to use the lavatories) and for him to stand and sit on the floor in front of my seat.

<h3>Highlights</h3>


This trip felt very different because it was more about spending time with my sister&#8217;s family than seeing friends, trying new places, or going out. We did go out &#8211; often fitting the kids in 4 car seats in my sister&#8217;s Rondo + 2 adults in front, but it was to do kid-friendly activities, which were:


<ul>

[caption id="" align="alignright" width="240"]<a title="2017-07-29_01-30-24" href="https://www.flickr.com/gp/aimeili/M67LmW" data-flickr-embed="true"><img src="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4323/36068502752_7f7dff4a48_n.jpg" alt="Pushing a $30 cart at ikea" width="240" height="320" /></a> Folks don&#8217;t seem to bat an eye when kids take the things on the showroom floor and use them for a bit&#8230;[/caption]
<script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script><strong>A visit to Ikea</strong> for play and lunch: this happens regularly in my sister&#8217;s family, but Bean was finally tall enough to play in the ball room so it was her first time; we took the boys to the unsupervised kids area in the showroom to play. At lunch, one of the staff pointed out the computer that was near the cash that lists all the ingredients in their food &#8211; the fish and chips were not safe (contains dairy), but the chicken fingers were safe so I got a kids meal instead with fries.</li>


    

<li><a href="http://www.coquitlam.ca/parks-recreation-and-culture/sport-and-recreation/dropins.aspx#Aquatics" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>$1 swim</strong> at the local community centre</a>: on Tuesdays and Thursdays, it&#8217;s only $1 a person, and the warm pool and communal change room is very large (with private changing stalls and showers in the latter) and you have a lot of accessories to use like life-jackets, floating boards, toys, and duck boats, plus you only need a quarter to lock up your stuff in the lockers AND you get your money back when you open it again. Don&#8217;t bring a water camera into the pool though, they don&#8217;t allow it. The littlest in our group ended up falling asleep on a duck boat when my sister took the two girls to shower.</li>


    

<li><strong>A meal at Red Robin</strong> meant you had unlimited sides &#8211; and they make the birthday girl stand up in her (high) chair when they sing their birthday song. I like independent restaurants but I have discovered that chain restaurants, like Red Robin, tend to be much better at providing ingredients / allergen information for each menu item. By the way, if you have the app, if you end up earning the 10th burger free on your visit, it will automatically trump any other promotion you may be offered, including 20% off your bill. Each kid also gets to take a balloon home where it is played with for days after.</li>

<script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script><strong>A day trip to ride the</strong> <strong>bus, Skytrain and Seabus</strong>: this in particular brings up memories of my aunt taking me to do this as a child; we didn&#8217;t use public transportation as a means to go somewhere, we just used it for the ride. The kids seemed to enjoy it as much as I did way back when. This time, I got to see and use the (finally done) Compass system for the first time, and going on a Saturday meant that everything was one-zone fare &#8211; and we managed to make all our connections before the time was up each way! There&#8217;s a small but free twirly slide into a pit of balls at Lonsdale Quay, but I forgot socks for my kids, so I took them to see the coin rides instead. I didn&#8217;t have money, but the $1 double decker London bus ride would&#8217;ve been the best value as it could&#8217;ve easily fit 4 kids in it &#8211; plus there&#8217;s a TV screen inside that acts like a window. Splurged on some local peaches and <a href="http://www.coconama.com/learn/nutrition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">coconama chocolate</a> because they had some nut and dairy-free versions (I&#8217;ve sampled some before but I can&#8217;t remember where &#8211; perhaps at the Handmade Show at the PNE). We were treated to some live music by a very talented young boy while we had our lunch, and I was surprised that my son ate an entire dynamite roll for lunch.</li>

<script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script><strong>A visit to Science World</strong>: they have added a relatively enclosed section [ref]with a staff member at the entrance monitoring who goes in/comes out &#8211; hoping to keep stray kids inside I think[/ref] dedicated for 0-5 year olds, which was amazing; they could have easily spent their entire day in this gallery &#8211; it had a climbing structure (no slide, but I&#8217;d recommend bringing socks), sensory play areas like water features, giant lite brite panel, kaleidoscope, balls, foam building blocks and plastic pipes, and a scoop-and-dump oatmeal-like area. The girls didn&#8217;t care for most of the shows, but we all enjoyed the bubble show on the main stage. The best part is that my sister found a <a href="https://www.scienceworld.ca/chinese-coupon-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2-for-1 admission promotion</a> posted on their site for those that can read Chinese. Odd, but we used it!</li>

<script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script><strong>Blueberry picking</strong>: I&#8217;ve picked strawberries, raspberries, and blackberries but I don&#8217;t recall picking blueberries before &#8211; they just fall off the tree in clusters when you give it a tug! Thankfully the kids didn&#8217;t really notice the long detour and traffic until closer to the end of our drive.</li>


    

<li><strong>Rocky Point:</strong> unlimited chips with kids fish and chips meal at <a href="http://www.pajos.com/locations/pajos-at-rocky-point-park-port-moody/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pajo&#8217;s</a>, my chance to try the <a href="http://www.tacofino.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tacofino</a> food truck at last (the fish burrito though big and great in value, was slightly disappointing as the fish didn&#8217;t stand out &#8211; should have done two fish tacos instead)  &#8211; happy to find out that their batter is vegan, and sorbet from Rocky Point ice creamery (though their ice cream is really the way to go) while the kids had a splash at the splash pad and played on the playground for a bit before heading home. Bought some <a href="http://jerkstore.ca/products/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">locally made beef jerky</a> at the pop-up market as it&#8217;s the first time I&#8217;ve seen jerky without any garlic or onions!</li>


</ul>

On the other days, the kids were happy to play in the yard with bubble guns and on the make-shift slide that their uncle made; the water table made its first appearance outside, and was actually filled with water (that I had forgotten was gifted to Bean when she was born &#8211; but was then re-gifted because there was no way would we lug a table back). So thankful that the weather was really good during the time we were there &#8211; not too wet and neither too hot nor too cold!  Now, I&#8217;m looking forward to when my sister and her two come to us in September &#8211; she decided to brave the flights too! I am hoping it will still be warm enough to try water beads with them and sidewalk chalk fun then, and maybe even the mini parachute from Amazon Prime Day.]]&gt;		</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				<![CDATA[Wow. Having just returned&nbsp;from the Western Caribbean/Florida and trying to write a recap,&nbsp;I come across this post sitting in my draft. It looks like I wrote down some notes, but never finished it, and I'm not sure if I ever will, so let's expand on some memories and post it now.


<hr />
The decision to visit during the summer, during peak&nbsp;travel period wasn&#8217;t on the table but we did&nbsp;have vague plans to visit sometime to meet my sister&#8217;s baby&nbsp;and for the rest of my family to meet ours. As it turned out, my aunt was getting remarried and invited everyone to their banquet reception and the timing worked, so we redeemed aeroplan points for one way, and bought tickets back after school started so the prices were much better[ref]thankfully, we didn&#8217;t have to modify travel plans as&nbsp;some extended family members had[/ref]. &nbsp;At the wedding is where I get a 3-minute lesson from a cousin on whiskey-tasting 101: taking a sip straight up, then sucking in one breath of air after a sip, and finally with 1 drop of ice in the shot before taking a sip &#8211; each one delivering a different profile / depth.
We all managed to get through the plane rides without too many tears. Bean sat in a car seat, which&nbsp;I much preferred her to be in than in a seat with just a lap belt; the height also allowed her to look out the window. She was happy to watch TV in silence (but no naps), and on the way back, we survived without having a seat back entertainment system &#8211; it also seems that the flight from YXX-Abbotsford is shorter by an hour! The baby was sure different from when Bean was his age &#8211; I couldn&#8217;t nurse him to sleep and keep him asleep; j.w&nbsp;had to help / intervene.

Warm sunny weather welcomed us at the start of our vacation, which made the trip to the&nbsp;Sea to Sky Summit very worthwhile, as it was warm and skies were clear so you could see the views&nbsp;without having to hike up the Chief&nbsp;(photo: that&#8217;s neither me nor Bean). We then visited (enriched and encouraged by) our friends in Woodinville, as we traditionally do every time we&#8217;re out there, and every time, we&#8217;re reluctant to leave.
Alas, the warm weather did not last, but held up enough so that when my dad&#8217;s car had a flat tire followed by a dead battery, I could take the baby out to the side of the road and wait &nbsp;&#8211; though we discovered that more people stopped because they saw me and the baby than when it was just j.w alone. And we all got sick, to the point where Bean developed hives and passed it to her cousin, and where I coughed so much coughed so much that the whole campsite heard me moan (dying cow?) in my sleep. We chickened out on the first day we were to set up camp (as it was damp and soggy and wouldn&#8217;t have helped my cold), and ended up joining our friends for 2 nights&nbsp;instead of 3. As it happens, we don&#8217;t generally hang out with too many families with young kids especially not all at once, so it took some time to get used to every child calling &#8220;mama, mama&#8221; and not wonder if it was Bean.

Bean and her cousin had a blast together, despite some tears throughout. We ended up staying at their place for the duration of our trip, so that the cousins could spend extended time together, and because my mom didn&#8217;t want our sickly germs prior to their cruise trip two weeks later [ref]to the point where I think I only saw her 3 times during our entire 3 weeks there &#8211; she probably figured she&#8217;d see us upon the end of their cruise anyway[/ref]. We visited the PNE &#8211; I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve been there since high school (the year I entered in some art contest, where my friend, Marie won!- and I took honourable mention). Since it poured, we stayed covered in the farm / agriculture area, where the kids get to go through stations and collect a treat at the end. I discovered that Bean was either afraid or didn&#8217;t like the (plastic) fish in her bucket as she would bury it at the bottom or not want to touch anything touching it.&nbsp;A momma pig looked happy nursing her many piglets, which made me think of the bond&nbsp;between breastfeeding mothers and babies and how it seemingly universal it is (though I wonder if they get latch problems too).
Whether coincidentally or not, it seems that&nbsp;every time we visit my &#8220;home&#8221; church, major leadership changes happen: a pastor resigns or a new pastor comes on board; this time, they introduced a Chinese pastor &nbsp;and another&nbsp;English pastor announced his leave. In spite of the news, we both felt refreshed, as we were actually able to sit and listen to two sermons in a row, in its entirety without being interrupted by a baby (in the nursery) or a toddler (with her cousin and/or my sister in the toddler program). Furthermore, it was a series on marriage; a rare sermon topic at our church, likely because our demographics is mainly students. I don&#8217;t remember what it was about, except that we don&#8217;t pray as a married couple enough &#8211; but I&#8217;m guilty of not spending enough time with God one-on-one, so that would be a good place to start.&nbsp;
During our visit, j.w started 3 months of parental leave; I was elated[ref]While it would have been incredible had he chosen to taken all 37 weeks &#8211; after all, it&#8217;s not often that one gets such an opportunity&nbsp;&#8211; he only wanted to take&nbsp;one month of absence from work for family bonding. I get it &#8211; I&#8217;ve seen the how (terribly) mothers are treated when they come back to work after a year of maternity leave &#8211; to a new team, new leadership, into a new assigned role and (worse) desk, and being away for less time should prevent that from happening; he also fears knowledge loss. &nbsp;However,&nbsp;we managed to negotiate it to three in exchange that I would watch&nbsp;Star Wars: the Force Awakens with him[/ref]. &nbsp;His parental leave began in the middle into&nbsp;our trip, and would end with another trip (sandwiching a road trip with friends midway).
Bebe turned 9 months while we were visiting:


<ul>
    

<li>this was the&nbsp;start of self-feeding / baby-led weaning; he pursed his lips and refused any pureed food; instead, he took to ribs and other chunky food</li>


    

<li>we found out that not all kiddie toilet seats are created equal, and had to order one from Amazon, where the curved seat prevented him from arching his back every time we put him on, which affected his bowel movements</li>


    

<li>bum shifting became a means for mobility</li>


</ul>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				<![CDATA[We've been back for about an equal amount of time that we've been away so this post is overdue!


<h3>Returning (to my childhood) home</h3>


I hadn&#8217;t been back for an extended period for a decade so I was looking forward to spending time with friends we don&#8217;t see when we go back and seeing family more often than when we usually do when we go back (which is significant when you realize people, like your parents especially, are a decade older!). Yet, it wasn&#8217;t long before we got into a regular routine (including baby getting sick every 2 weeks and her sleeping-in) and my ambitions to bring babe to more activities resulted in only one visit to the library story time and song program, two visits to <a href="http://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/topic.page?id=F652EE0BCB224DC4A51BE9765B50817D&amp;title=StrongStart%20BC" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">StrongStart</a>, a visit or two to each indoor play space (Guildford Recreation Centre (1), Brentwood (1), Coquitlam Centre (2), and Lougheed Mall (1)), and one-time visits with friends and extended family we don&#8217;t normally see on our short visits. Towards the end of the trip, I realized that in my procrastination (laziness or perception that everything is so far), I didn&#8217;t end up seeing everyone we wanted &#8211; at first, the thinking was, &#8220;Oh, we have all this time&#8230;&#8221; but then by the last week or so, it became a scramble to fit everyone we wanted to see into our schedule and we had to miss some people.&nbsp; But, this real-life lesson hit home for me when it comes to our spiritual state: we often tend to put God off in our lives, thinking that there&#8217;s so much time in our lives to think about that until it&#8217;s too late.
What really struck me as being strange, is that I didn&#8217;t have a strong desire to go snowshoeing this time &#8211; which seems to reflect how I felt about snow activities growing up; it was not until I moved away and returned home that I wanted to snowboard and snowshoe (and ice skate). I&#8217;m not sure if it was because we acclimatized to the warmer weather that I didn&#8217;t really want to venture into the cold, whereas coming from cold makes the mountain weather more tolerable.
Little Bean hit many milestones while there including walking and saying &#8220;Daddy!&#8221; for the first time, and while it took some time for her to be herself again (after being intimidated by new faces and places), I was happy to see that she found friends more her age to play with, especially at church, and that her separation anxiety seemed to taper off, which meant she was okay in the church nursery &#8211; even to the point where mommy and her friend was able to get a smoothie sans toddler in tow!


<h3>Returning (to this family&#8217;s) home</h3>


Just as it took her almost a month to adapt to her surroundings while she was away, she also seemed to feel less at ease to freely roam and explore back at home when we returned, and although the first few times back at church meant she was more clingy, she&#8217;s now back to herself and seems more open to meeting new faces and spending time with people without her parents always by her side. While I do miss the daily option to go to a free program at a local school for her, a childcare program at church, the number of free indoor play spaces, and her same-age friend and her cousin, it&#8217;s good to be back&nbsp; &#8211; and we can work on finding things to do here and getting to know other children here.
Upon our return, I learned a few things:


<ul>
    

<li>Buzz Lightyear somehow managed to get two hours ahead! (my side table alarm clock which seems to never be on time so I stopped resetting it every so often)</li>


    

<li>If you don&#8217;t want your toys and other things to be covered in dust, especially when you&#8217;re renovating, put them away or make sure they&#8217;re covered</li>


    

<li>And in terms of milestones, I stopped counting. Except that at 17 months, she willfully disobeyed, which when it happened, I thought hashtag <em>#originalsin</em> and it became another spiritual lesson: we teach our children to do many things, but we don&#8217;t need to teach them to give you a look that says they&#8217;re going to test the boundaries and then go about doing what you instructed them not to do, just as God often tells us things for our own good but we don&#8217;t listen and do the complete opposite.</li>


</ul>

				<![CDATA[]]>		]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				<![CDATA[My grandfather recently celebrated his 90th birthday. I can't imagine being around for so long and living so independently like they are still. So much must have changed in nine decades: he would have lived through the effects of a World War with the Japanese occupation, seen the rise of technology (including explorations in space such as man on the moon) &mdash; though they have yet to adopt the Internet, and lived to greet at least three generations.&nbsp; If those in my generation lived that long, we would remember the fall of Pluto as a planet (maybe man on Mars), the rise of the Internet and wireless communication, and while no war has become World War III yet, "terrorists" and wars are still everywhere.
I've taken some steps down memory lane while here, and it's slightly disorienting when the things you remember are still somewhat there but also somewhat changed; it's definitely a reminder that time doesn't stand still or wait for you to come back:


<ul>
    

<li>The neighbourhood of my childhood has changed from two storey houses to a mix of houses with the same exteriors (perhaps somewhat updated inside like ours), small multi-storey condo townhouses, and demolished-and-rebuilt homes with forceful grandeur that feel somewhat out-of-place with the neighbouring smaller, original houses and the existing above-ground wiring on the street.</li>


    

<li>Because of the new condo developments, streets have either become wider or have even seemingly appeared out of nowhere (where the house with the pet goat once stood)</li>


    

<li>The elementary school of my youth and my dreams,&nbsp; has the same layout but updated and expanded (thus shrinking the play area and the awesome wooden fort structures have been replaced with plastic). I look at my itty bitty self on the wall in the school photos and the faint lines left behind that hint at the doors of the past, but stark reality hits me that I am now the parent and no longer a student when a child care worker wonders if I&#8217;m lost, <em>ma&#8217;am</em> (yes, I don&#8217;t recognize this new wing!) and when I ask the office staff about whether any teachers are still around as I recognize one or two names on their staff list, they are quick to laugh and say that they&#8217;re probably retired by now. Today, the <a href="https://www.surreyschools.ca/PreschoolEducation/StrongStart/Pages/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">StrongStart</a> classroom (an early years program that helps children become familiar with a school setting particularly their local school and prepare them for kindergarten and beyond, which as a parent I think is an amazing initiative) was once where I spent Grade 3 (though it&#8217;s been changed to accommodate the program and the renovations). Ah, the circle of life.</li>


    

<li>At <a title="Memories of the Spot" href="http://her.happyhippos.ca/2010/07/memories-of-the-spot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">White Spot</a>, burgers don&#8217;t taste as good as I remember; the buns are chewy and stick to the top of my mouth. My father says that it&#8217;s because they used to bake them in-house and now they just outsource them. While the drive-in is still available at the Guildford location, they renovated too, but the service isn&#8217;t for the better. We sat there after we were done waiting for someone to come collect our dishes and ask if we wanted any dessert (we did), but no one came. Sadly, we had to flag down someone for the bill and skipped the dessert.</li>


</ul>


But really, aging is a part of life and change is necessary, because if things were stagnant and didn&#8217;t change, it might become like the completed <a href="http://www.biv.com/article/2014/11/prime-surrey-commercial-property-sits-empty-16-yea/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">commercial building that still sits empty after 16 years</a> (&#8230;was a manure mushroom farm before that&#8230;)]]&gt;		</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				<![CDATA[We're back from our first family vacation on our own, and what a memorable way to start paternity leave / duo parental leave!&nbsp; For those who have doubts about traveling with an infant, I can now say that traveling with a 10-month old is perfectly doable, as long as your schedule and activities are a bit flexible. When we were deciding on destination options after narrowing it down to a week-long cruise, we opted out of Europe because it would mean more walking around and the Caribbean because of the time of the year, so we chose to visit Alaska instead.
My husband opted to take one month parental leave, which I am very thankful for, as we got a chance to bond as a family, with the first half in Alaska and Vancouver and the last week and a bit hanging out at home. I felt very spoiled to not have to cook (except for cooking wild sockeye for dinner one time, which we thoroughly enjoyed), clean, or do housework while on vacation and for the first time in a very long time, we had enough sleep, retiring early in the evenings and napping when the little one napped during the days at sea.


<h3>Celebrity Millennium</h3>


[caption id="attachment_4027" align="alignnone" width="640"]<img class="size-large wp-image-4027" src="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/IMG_0274-1024x682.jpg" alt="Celebrity Millennium at Icy Strait Point on a rainy day" height="426" width="640"/> Celebrity Millennium at Icy Strait Point on a rainy day[/caption]
Initially, I had wanted to cruise with Holland America, after hearing so much good reviews with them, but we ended up settling with Celebrity Cruises instead. Even after we booked, our travel agent managed to find a better deal: Little Bean cruised for free, plus we got a stateroom upgrade for the same price! Seeing that we would be limited to our cabin when Little Bean was sleeping, we paid a premium for a balcony so that we could sit outside and read or appreciate the view despite the chilly weather &#8211; though of course, after staying in a balcony stateroom from our honeymoon, we haven&#8217;t been able to downgrade again.
This line was also an upgrade to the other cruise lines we have traveled with in the past, and despite my initial reservations about them being owned by Royal Caribbean (which we had negative experiences with on our previous cruise), we were very happy with our experience overall.&nbsp;Aside from the glitches at the beginning with a non-functional stateroom fridge and missing baby food (yes, you can pre-order baby food jars beforehand at no extra charge!), this one seemed less in-your-face cheesy, the decor less tacky, people were more orderly (less chaos on the &#8220;shopping nights&#8221;), and the food quality and execution to be better (the pastries and desserts at the café were a highlight, especially the almond croissants). Service seemed less forced, but wasn&#8217;t absent either; dining room staff went above and beyond to switch us from set time dining (and shared table) to our own table flexible dining times, and our server brought Little Bean her own plate of food that wasn&#8217;t even on the menu (avocado, watermelon, and other melon cubes) even though we always had a jar of baby food with us. We were pleasantly surprised that we got a complimentary tour of the kitchen galley, unlike other cruise lines, and learned just how vast the kitchens are and how much is made from scratch (including the lovely pastries and desserts)! I also appreciated that the activities they offered on board went beyond activities like basic ballroom or napkin folding, like basic watercolours, and that you could borrow toys from the children&#8217;s area for the duration of the cruise. Furthermore, if your wee one spent any time in the children&#8217;s area, playing with any of the toys, they took care to disinfect it at the end of the day (provided the parent tossed it into the used-toys bin).
Okay, so the targeted demographics on this cruise line is definitely not your Disney or Royal Caribbean Oasis/Allure of the Seas ships; there are no rock-climbing walls, water slides, zip-lines, carousels, costumed characters, or cinematic theatre under the stars (the latter mayhaps because of the chilly weather, seeing that the outdoor pool was also closed). But, the performances, though not Broadway, were solid; j.w was impressed that the lead performers could both sing and dance at the same time. With the limited options for evening activities, that meant that we could retire early without feeling that I missed too much. I was certainly surprised to learn that this cruise was the first cruise for many of the older folks we met!
Little Bean made new friends quickly: Maria, the host at the dining room, the Metropolitan; Azem, the assistant Maitre&#8217;D (who just adores babies, and even introduced her to his fiancée over from the Q&#8217;Sine to meet her on the last night, which I thought was the sweetest thing); and little Emma, daughter of a God-fearing&nbsp; father who serves in the Air Force, and whose Christian mother shared about her struggles with transitioning to a stay-at-home-mom.


<h3>The Weather</h3>


[caption id="" align="alignnone" width="640"]<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/aimeili/14299623020/"><img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2896/14299623020_8a36595a36_z.jpg" alt="" height="480" width="640"/></a> A rainy day at Icy Strait Point[/caption]
Although we had hoped for sunshine and warm weather (which they had a week before our sailing as we heard from one of j.w&#8217;s former pastors that he randomly bumped into at the Anchorage airport),&nbsp; the clouds and rain followed us for the most part, but it didn&#8217;t deter us from seeing the sights; in fact, I think because of it, we met less people along the way. God kept us dry for the most part though and gave us sunshine in patches, which meant staying cool and having more dramatic photos; the day it poured, we were either watching whales from our balcony, or driving along the Skagway highway (we had a different view on the way back, when it cleared up!). The $8 stroller cover also kept our little one dry. Plus, we had almost a week of sunshine and warmth in Vancouver!
The inclement weather may have been the reason for the rocky waters during the first two days from Seward to Juneau; I just ended up sleeping early when I started to feel it in the claustrophobic washroom in our stateroom. Turned out that many others fared worse &#8211; the mom we made friends with had to skip the rest of her dinner, and one of the shows had to be postponed to another day.
So, what did we see in Alaska?


<h3>Alaska &#8211; Glaciers</h3>


When we first chose Alaska, I had doubts with the destination choice as my mother didn&#8217;t seem to like the itinerary when they went a decade ago; she had found the ports relatively uninteresting. However, she did say her favourite part was visiting Hubbard Glacier, so we made sure that was included in our itinerary. Ironically, I was actually disappointed with it the most, perhaps because I was expecting a grandeur that my mother had described. Sadly, perhaps it is because of the environmental impact and decay over the last decade or because of the poor weather, but we didn&#8217;t get as close to the glacier as expected and it looked much smaller and less majestic than the photos that my parents had of it when we compared photos later. Fortunately, we managed to see a few other glaciers as well, including Trail Glacier as seen from the train trip from Anchorage to Seward, Exit Glacier in Seward, which you can almost touch when you walk right up to it, and Mendenhall Glacier in Juneau.

<h3>Alaska &#8211; Wildlife</h3>


Oddly enough, one of my favourite ports was Icy Strait Point, a fishing village that is close to Hoonah that&#8217;s really only dedicated to cruise ship traffic. The sights to see around the port didn&#8217;t seem all that terrific, especially on a rainy day, but we were rewarded with views of whales along the shoreline <em>and</em> from our balcony. We returned to the ship much earlier than the sailing time, but we had great views of pods of fin whales despite the rain. Apparently on the port side, those in the buffet dining room and on a kayak excursion had a treat; they saw with 6 whales playing together, whereas we, on the starboard side, saw 3 at a time.

We also saw many bald eagles flying about throughout our trip, notably in Icy Strait Point and in Juneau (the capital city of Alaska, where no roads lead out of Juneau; you can only arrive via air or sea). Most of the other wildlife we encountered was during our 5 hour train ride from Anchorage to Seward: a family of grizzlies, a black bear, mountain sheep, and young caribou dashing across the pond. The one other &#8220;wildlife&#8221; we came across was a family of slugs in Ketchikan, which I found amusing that people were grossed out over them on Facebook, but perhaps I grew up seeing slugs everywhere that it merely served as a reminder of the West Coast climate.

*Hubbard Glacier and Inside Passage was just a cruising day / day &#8220;at sea&#8221;


<h4>Anchorage</h4>


[caption id="" align="alignright" width="172"]<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/aimeili/14711863121/"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3915/14711863121_b3f34fc6ae_m.jpg" alt="" height="240" width="172"/></a> Alaska Railroad on tilt-shift / toy-mode[/caption]
Anchorage, the closest airport to our departure port is 5 hours away by rail, which was one of the most rewarding trips by train I&#8217;ve taken &#8211; with incredible views of wildlife, glaciers, and other scenery. Because we travelled on a day that didn&#8217;t have too many passengers, we were able to sit in the bubble car for the majority of it instead of our assigned seats. For the city with an international airport, I was surprised how small it seemed; the Grand Anchorage hotel looked to be further from the train station on the map, but it was just a 5 minute walk away.


<h4>Seward</h4>


Seward was a much quainter town, and I ended up really loving our stay at <a href="http://sauerdoughlodging.com/the-sleeper/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sauerdough Lodging</a>, aside from the pack n&#8217; play looking very dirty, the layout of the place was perfect for us: the futon couch happened to be on an incline, they had a lounging chair perfect for nursing, and the kitchen was separated enough for us to cook (the fresh wild sockeye salmon) and enjoy our meal while the little one slept; that night was one of the few nights that we stayed up late enough to see the skies get dark (after 10pm). They were also the folks who told us about the free shuttle that Seward offers.

Bob may be your uncle, but our BOB really pulled through for us, especially on our hike to Exit Glacier. We decided to buy one right before our trip, and I had enough fitness credits left to claim it on my work benefits insurance plan. We took it with us and it really served us well; I found that it was easier to maneuver and that it felt lighter than our 10lb Peg Perego Aria even though it is a 25lb stroller, and Little Bean seemed quite comfortable in it.

<h4>Juneau</h4>


We rented a car for the day ($30ish) and drove to see Mendenhall Glacier and the falls, and also visited Alaskan Brewing Company, which offered 4-5 generous glasses of samples of their beers, but sadly, I don&#8217;t drink that much alcohol. We lugged a case back with us (choosing to put the case in the stroller over the baby and carrying her instead since she was lighter), but we had too much stuff to bring back from Vancouver so we had to leave a few in BC for now.

<h4>Skagway</h4>


Instead of taking the $200+ White Pass Yukon rail excursion, we opted to rent a car for $80/day and drove a similar scenic route.&nbsp; Now, I can say that I&#8217;ve been to all the provinces, except Manitoba and one territory! Even though we put in hundreds of kilometres on the car in terms of mileage, the drives were quite leisurely &#8211; along the mountain roads and every so often, you&#8217;d be rewarded with a view along the pull outs. Memorable stops include Fraser, BC (one of the most hassle-free border crossings ever), the Yukon sign, Carcross (desert dunes and for lunch), and Emerald Lake &#8211; the color of the water living up to its name.

<h4>Icy Strait Point</h4>


Unless you do a kayak excursion or you happen upon some whales (as mentioned above and as shown below), there doesn&#8217;t seem to be much to see at this stop.
[caption id="" align="alignnone" width="525"] Open mouths of fin whales, as seen from our balcony[/caption]


<h4>Ketchikan</h4>


Although one of Ketchikan&#8217;s signs says that they get a lot of rain, we actually saw sunshine at this port. Being the Chinese that we are, we made good use of the $4 fee to use the funicular for a 60-second ride up to the hotel by taking it up a few times, and then hiking down two different short trails. Though on our last hike, we walked up the stairs in the middle of a &#8220;street&#8221; (the street IS the stairway) and took it down. Creek Street is probably the most unique area, and according to repeat cruisers, you can practically wade through the salmon that swims upstream there if you come at the right time (later in August?). We also found an extensive outdoors (thinking shoes and outer wear gear) store near the port, which had some good deals as well.


<h4>Vancouver</h4>


[caption id="" align="alignnone" width="500"]<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/aimeili/14455214004/"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5502/14455214004_b2bf5a951a.jpg" alt="" height="333" width="500"/></a> Downtown Vancouver, in the distance[/caption]
Well, what did we do in Vancouver? We ate a lot, as usual, and visited our friends in the Seattle area again. I really enjoyed the duck confit at the French restaurant that my sister told us about, Café Salade de Fruits &#8211; great value: good prices, portions, and taste.


<h2>Milestones</h2>


Little Bean sprouted a number of teeth (2-3?) while on vacation, but it didn&#8217;t seem to bother her all that much except for the week leading up to them poking out. She also got better at standing supported, especially for long periods of time while playing on the activity table (we found it to be very good for her development so we ended up getting a similar one once we got back!)
In the category of food, we&nbsp; discovered that she uses her pincer grip without any problems (using her forefinger and thumb to pick up food like avocado and watermelon bits), and likes to feed other people her food too. Like her mommy, she seems to love bread &#8211; this discovery was purely accidental; our table for 2 was small, so the dishes are often close to her high chair. When the basket was put down on the table, her hand reached out and grabbed a small loaf bun and quickly stuffed it in her mouth. She showed us that she could &#8220;clap&#8221; (applaud) and point at things which captivate her attention. Towards the end of the trip, it looked like she managed to sip from a sippy cup, but she drank water from a cup directly with much less effort, though the way she does is still like how she suckles. We were also very surprised that she seemed to know that certain things were not food, like when she played with sand for the very first time &#8211; she didn&#8217;t try to put any of it into her mouth!


<hr />
PS. Finally got around to posting about our trip. Month 11 has flown by too quickly, with the highlight being a visit from my sister and niece. Oh, and happy birthday, Prince George!]]&gt;		</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				<![CDATA[Even though we're not even halfway through month seven yet, it hasn't been without its joys and challenges.


<h3>Firsts</h3>


Little Bean had her first airplane adventure! It* almost seems coordinated that all the babies and toddlers were situated close together on the first flight. Great for isolating noise, but I&#8217;m sure it wasn&#8217;t fun for the non-parents in our immediate vicinity. Perhaps it was a combination of late flying, teething, and ear pressure, but the second leg resulted in a more cranky (and thus, crying) baby than the first. We tried baby Tylenol on the return trip, and perhaps that, in addition to daytime flying, resulted in a calmer and happier baby, who even smiled at fellow passengers and interacted with them (so yes, we drugged our child; my mother told us she used to use Dimetapp on us&#8230;)
We also discovered that she really likes babies, in addition to other young&#8217;uns and adults. While her first visit to the church nursery was met with tears (and thus, an early pick up and nap in the <a href="http://www.mamankangourou.com/en/product/asiatik--mei-tai-type" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mamankangarou</a>**), she would actively want to touch her baby cousin and play with her newfound friends (including those in Seattle, a first US visit for her)! Just showing her baby cousin perked her up right away from being grumpy (resulted from&nbsp; being woken up early to catch our return flight home); she even started socializing with the toddler behind us on our flight home.&nbsp; A fun afternoon for the mommies (chatting and taking photos) and her first playdate with her newfound friend led me to discover that she&#8217;s ready for the &#8220;walker-turned-exersaucer-that-has-no-saucer-or-wheels&#8221; contraption as well (a quick Google search tells me that the Baby Einstein brand calls it the &#8220;Musical Motion Activity Jumper&#8221;). This I will miss dearly: the opportunity to watch her grow up with her cousin and the children of my friends back home.
Other milestones:


<ul>
    

<li>While her bite was a tad sharp last month, the first tooth on her bottom left is finally poking through</li>


    

<li>I didn&#8217;t realize she has been able to sit without support until I saw a photo on Facebook of her playing with a giant banana. This wasn&#8217;t the case just a week earlier at her playdate&#8230;!</li>


    

<li>Sleep (and its challenges): We managed to wean her from being swaddled at night while she slept in a pack n&#8217; play bassinet. However, she tended to scooch over to the edge every time and mash her face against the mesh or bury it in the crib sheet. I suspect that&#8217;s because she likes her face / lip against something, which is in line to what she does in her car seat as well. This has not translated well when transitioning her back into the crib &#8211; my theory is that it&#8217;s too &#8220;open&#8221; and she doesn&#8217;t like it. On a related note, a friend asked me what was one of the biggest lessons I learned as a new parent, and I had to say do whatever it takes for your baby to sleep. A doula gave me one advice that worked wonders: find out and remove the stimulus/stimuli that prevents her from sleeping and she may have an easier time of sleep even on the go! (answer: visual stimuli)</li>


    

<li>The day after we returned, she developed a 1-day fever; it was sad times almost all day for all &#8211; even the digital thermometer had a sad face. We are so happy to see the happy Little Bean again</li>


    

<li>(not really 7 month related, but&#8230;) apparently vomit happens a lot to many babies, at least that&#8217;s what the friendly sales lady at a local baby store said. She was surprised to learn that it was Little Bean&#8217;s first time, at the tail end of her 6 months. We were just thankful that nothing landed on the demo glider that Daddy was sitting in</li>


</ul>




<hr />
*The &#8220;It&#8221; at the beginning of the sentence greatly bothers me because it&#8217;s an ambiguous referent, but I haven&#8217;t found a better way to rephrase it
** The stretchy&nbsp; meitai carrier was the best $21 spent on a baby item by the way. Though, we tried the travel / performance ergo baby that my sister has: it&#8217;s super comfy and convenient &#8211; which is probably worth the investment especially for treks like snowshoeing (her first time with us as well on this trip!), though it costed 3x more. We have an older, original ergobaby carrier hand-me-down, but I&#8217;m questioning its authenticity at the moment.]]&gt;		</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				<![CDATA[A friend asked me what to do in Vancouver with only a day, while staying near the Waterfront in June without a vehicle. I don't spend too much time downtown when I'm home, but here are some ideas (of course, many of them involving food) - those in bold are my favourites:
<strong>Food &amp; Drink</strong>


<ul>
	

<li><a title="Food truck hours" href="http://streetfoodapp.com/vancouver" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Food trucks/stands</a>, like Tacofino (have not been) or Japadog (been to the store)</li>


	

<li><strong>Gelato at <a title="Gelato" href="http://www.bellagelateria.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bella Gelateria</a></strong></li>


	

<li>Lunch time? I hear that <a href="http://meatandbread.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Meat+Bread</a> is good too, especially for the porchetta sandwiches!</li>


	

<li>Want a local drink? Stop by <a title="Beer" href="http://steamworks.com/brew-pub" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steamworks</a> in Gastown (close by &#8211; their home brew root beer is used to be a nice alternative to alcohol if you&#8217;re not really a drinker) or <a title="More beer" href="http://gib.ca/about/tours-tastings/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Granville Island Brewery</a>, maybe?</li>


	

<li>Seafood: Joe Forte&#8217;s, if you&#8217;re not on a budget ($$$) &#8211; per J.w&#8217;s recommendation. Especially the miso black cod he would say; fresh catch of the day features at <a title="Dinner menu" href="http://www.vancouverdine.com/sandbar/menus/dinner" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sandbar</a> at Granville Island (or happy hour mussel+fries+beer $12 special), ramen at either Kintaro (get the medium to fatty broth <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f609.png" alt="😉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> ), Santouku (though that&#8217;s available inToronto now too), izayaka at Guu (also in Toronto) or Kingyo (also in Toronto &#8211; haven&#8217;t been to either location), and here&#8217;s a tweet dedicated to sushi:</li>


</ul>




<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">@<a href="https://twitter.com/tableformaple">tableformaple</a> DT:Miku ($$$: <a title="http://flic.kr/p/5ZikAS" href="http://t.co/OybP3ljSpG">flic.kr/p/5ZikAS</a>), notbeen: Minami/Tojos, Kits:Hitoe ($$/Jp), Bby:SushiTown ($/Kor), Coq:SushiCali ($/Ko)
— Emily (@bptweets) <a href="https://twitter.com/bptweets/status/329579523421126658">May 1, 2013</a></blockquote>


<strong>By foot or Skytrain
</strong>


<ul>
	

<li><strong>Rent a bicycle on Denman and take it for a ride around the Stanley Park seawall</strong> (if pressed for time, this is what I would do first)</li>


	

<li>Take the seabus over to North Vancouver&#8217;s Lonsdale Quay and browse the market</li>


	

<li><strong>Take the Rainbow (Aquabus?) ferry to Granville Island from False Creek, and walk around Granville Island</strong> (shopping &#8211; see below, or touring around the Emily Carr Art Gallery), have a bite or a drink or two (like Sandbar  &#8211; see above), or even catch a comedy show at the theatre</li>


	

<li>Visit the Science Center or Vancouver Aquarium if you like to see fishies and science exhibits (more family friendly)</li>


	

<li>Shopping (boutiques or shops): Robson and Granville Streets, take the skytrain to Richmond and shop at the Asian malls (like Aberdeen &#8211; get a 8juice there as well from the food court, or a &#8220;snowflake ice&#8221; dessert), Granville Island (and its market)</li>


	

<li>Walk along the beach at English Bay</li>


	

<li>Visit the Vancouver Art Gallery or <a title="1/2 price tickets" href="http://www.ticketstonight.ca/half-price-tickets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">catch a show at half price</a></li>


</ul>


<strong>By Bus</strong>


<ul>
	

<li>Queen Elizabeth Park</li>


	

<li>Kits Beach / Jericho Beach / Kitslano</li>


	

<li>UBC campus (if you like academia settings with mountains and water in the background)</li>


	

<li>Grouse Mountain (and the Grouse Grind if you like walking up steps up a mountain &#8211; it&#8217;s much more scenic than the CN Tower climb I&#8217;d imagine, but I actually find it quite mundane). Lynn Canyon in North Vancouver (with a free suspension bridge &#8211; skip Capilano if you&#8217;re on a money-saving trip)</li>


	

<li>Kitslano / Kerrisdale (if you do, then get some Japanese food at Hitoe and french pastries and coffee at <strong>La Foubourg</strong>, and high tea /scones at the Secret Garden Tea Company, visit Rocky Mountain Soap for all natural soap / body products from the West Coast)</li>


</ul>


You may wish to avoid East Hastings near Gastown if you&#8217;re walking, especially at night; it&#8217;s generally safe but if you&#8217;re unfamiliar with the area, it can be an eye-opener.
<em>If you had a car, I&#8217;d definitely suggest a hike up the Chief in Squamish, but I guess that&#8217;s for another day <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></em>
Any other suggestions for someone without a car?]]&gt;		</p>

<p>
I found a deal on the <a href="http://www.redflagdeals.com" target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer">Redflagdeals&#8217;</a> forum the day before I met up w Tunger for lunch and games time at his workplace. For $4.95, we each had this huge plate of calamari (mmmm, lightly battered!) and when i got home, my mom wanted to try it that night for dinner! Well, I declined so they didn&#8217;t go, but the next day, my sister and her friends all went to eat there and so do the rest of my family (at different tables). I stuck with calamari b/c the chicken and the lamb looked/tasted really dry. Their business strategy worked pretty well; although tables were empty and available (ie. seats were left), they made people stand outside the door (to look like they were very busy and because the restaurant doesn&#8217;t have too much waiting space), they only served you and sat you down when they could handle you (instead of sitting you down and making you wait for eons).</p>




<p>After BBT, we hit <a href="http://www.ncix.com" target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer">NCIX</a> to pick up two online orders, to which I formulated a theory. When a girl enters a lingerie shop, for example, like La Senza (which I have been only once to buy a &#8220;gift&#8221; for a guy) with a guy, the sales girl will likely ask the girl shopper if they could help her first, instead of addressing the guy. Perhaps at NCIX, it works the reverse. Maybe because Tunger is very tall and approachable(?), but I theorize that because he&#8217;s a guy, he gets service first. I suppose in most cases, it may be true that the girl is the accessory since every time I&#8217;ve been there, the girls are either a) kids, b) girlfriends, or c) wives. Thus, it may make sense that the sales guy would asked him, &#8220;May I help you?&#8221; without realising that he was the accessory; he wasn&#8217;t the one purchasing from them.</p>




<p>
Speaking of NCIX, all of the deals I bought from them so far were all under $10 until this time &#8211; to which they photocopied my ID and made me sign a credit card receipt. Did I ever mention about the time I bought an internal 6-in-1 media card reader for 0.99$? It was for a specific motherboard only and it needed an extra 3.5in internal bay, but because I had neither, I downloaded some modified drivers, and took out my two usb ports from the front of my case (image i)and just used the usb slot (so now it&#8217;s a permanently fixed external reader card reader :P) (ii) to connect it and now it works beautifully (tho my computer now looks rather ghetto/modded)! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>




<p>Oh, I also put up the Jasmine-flavoured Crest toothpaste that my parents bought in HK (iii) (just cuz i thought that was rather different):</p>

<p>PS. If you want anything from Toronto/Loo or Vancouver before I fly, please let me know and I&#8217;ll see what I can do :).</p>

The more time I spend here, the less time I spend <i>here</i>.  And, the more I have to thank God for &#8211; renewed and new friendships, answered prayers, opportunities to witness and seeing Him at work (double-meaning intended) as a result! I&#8217;ve deliberately tried to avoid summing up my daily happenings as working life can get pretty routine and boring, but special occasions do give my life some colour.</p>




<p>
Thanks to those who sent me birthday greetings! =) Although the actual day was quite normal, the days surrounding it has certainly been special and quite memorable including mailed packages (<a href="http://eyesi.blogspot.com/2004/06/bouquet-of-flowers.html" target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer">see photo for example</a>) and dinner coupled with an evening on the beach &#8211; feeling the warm sea breeze brush past my shoulders, hearing the silver waters brush against the rocky shores, watching the bonfires of students, and seeing the twinkling stars in the night sky. Ahh, so this is what Vancouver has to offer! =)
</p>




<p>
I sure am looking forward to the rest of this summer if this is only a taste of what&#8217;s to come! 30C forecasted for this weekend and early next week; I can&#8217;t wait! =) Do visit if you get a chance &#8211; I&#8217;ll be seeing my dear Vonnekins this weekend hopefully (boy, speaking to her on the phone was such a challenge, whereas it would seem almost natural in &#8216;loo &#8211; *sigh*, I need more Cantonese-speaking friends here!).
</p>

Incident #328. Well, not really, but I&#8217;ve lost count how ghetto my neighbourhood is &#8211; yes, we have prostitutes standing on the corner two blocks down every morning (don&#8217;t know why it&#8217;d be morning, but they&#8217;re apparently diff girls everytime). I guess it doesn&#8217;t help that this city, with a population of 350,000 is the second largest in this area, outside of Vancouver. I thank God that He was definitely watching over my sister last night, and it sure hits close to home because it literally did happen close to home (within 5 houses down), to a family member, and it could&#8217;ve turned ugly if my sister didn&#8217;t lock her doors. By His grace, it was not me that was driving yesterday evening around 6:00 pm, for I am not in the habit of locking my car doors (I either forget or just don&#8217;t), even though my mother always reminds me.
</p>



<p>
<b>To my friends who drive near my neighbourhood: lock <i>ALL</i> your doors, <i>always</i>.</b>
</p>




<p>
Anyhow, my sister was driving alone and stopped at the stop sign waiting to turn onto the main street. Some caucasian guy steps out from the shadows and knocks on the passenger window, trying to say something to her. But, of course, my sister&#8217;s smart enough to ignore him. So then, he goes on to try to pull the passenger door open, but because my sister is more sensible than I am, she remembered to lock the door before she left the driveway. She almost honked the horn, but then I think God sent a guardian angel on time, and another car pulled out from another street and the guy ran away! I can&#8217;t believe she didn&#8217;t call 9-1-1. Aiiiieeee&#8230;.I&#8217;d be traumatized for the rest of my life if I was in her position; I&#8217;m already quite emotionally shaken over this close call&#8230;.at least I hope to remember to lock my doors when I&#8217;m in the car now!</p>
