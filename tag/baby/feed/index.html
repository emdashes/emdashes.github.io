								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				When we were expecting our first, we were graciously lent a BabyBjörn&nbsp;carrier, where the baby could be carried facing out or in. We didn&#8217;t know much about babywearing, and Bean didn&#8217;t really take to the BabyBjörn; I did eventually come across a <a href="https://skeptoid.com/blog/2013/01/25/will-the-babybjorn-endanger-your-infants-health/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">controversial warning</a> to watch out for &#8220;crotch-danglers&#8221; (ie. instead of dangling by their legs, that they&#8217;re supported by a seat or their legs are in a M / froggy style so that they&#8217;re not contributing to <a href="http://www.ikea.com/ca/en/catalog/products/20327709/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hip dysplasia)</a>, so we returned it, since she didn&#8217;t seem to take to it anyway and because I didn&#8217;t want to risk making her <a href="http://hipdysplasia.org/developmental-dysplasia-of-the-hip/infant-signs-and-symptoms/hip-click/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hip-clicks</a> any worse.<br />
Thankfully, that wasn&#8217;t the end of babywearing: a $21 <a href="http://www.mamankangourou.com/en/product/asiatik--mei-tai-type" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hybrid mei dai / stretchy wrap by MamanKangourou</a>&nbsp;seemed to be a good find which ended up working really well for us when she was smaller[ref]minor complaint are the long straps[/ref] &#8211; at that point, I had no idea what the carries were (mei dai / stretchy wrap?) and had never heard of the company, but I enjoyed its coziness / snugglies, the extra neck support, and she enjoyed napping in it especially during Sunday church service, and when she was big enough to fit in a suspected fake[ref]which the company refused to confirm because it wasn&#8217;t purchased from the retailer vs. Sophie the Giraffe&#8217;s company who confirmed that a hand-me-down one was old, but authentic[/ref] ergo hand-me-down without the infant insert, she liked to be carried in that as well &#8211; even into toddlerhood. A friend allow loaned us a linen Sakura Bloom ring sling, but I didn&#8217;t have the heart to use it all that much because of its cost!<br />
Baby #2 might have been neglected in some things for better or worse (#secondbaby), but this time around, I looked into getting a ring sling that wasn&#8217;t crazy expensive and found one on Etsy for $40 after not being able to source any local handmade ones. When it came, it wasn&#8217;t as soft as I expected so it was harder to adjust, but with the help of my chiropractor, she showed me how to use it so that it&#8217;s comfortable for baby or toddler and me; maybe it wasn&#8217;t broken in yet, but now I know that the sling is probably made of duck cloth (one-sided print).<br />
Enter the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/DIYBabywearing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DIY Babywearing</a> Facebook group. I don&#8217;t know how I ended up on there, but I&#8217;ve learned a lot from this community, with one successfully completed project: an Ikea <a href="http://www.ikea.com/ca/en/catalog/products/20327709/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stilfull</a> tablecloth converted to two soft no-sew (but hemmed) ring slings! Had I known about how easy and inexpensive it is to make your own wrap/carrier, I would have done it from the start, and used $15 instead of paying $40 for one. I&#8217;m likely at a <a href="http://wiki.babywearingdiy.com/do/view/Main/WrapCarries" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">base size 5</a> so I can use the Stilfull tablecloth length for size 2 carries and under when I don&#8217;t want to use the rings, including the following front/hip carries:<br />

<p>By the way, I got my weight-tested rings from <a href="http://babywearings.ca" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">babywearings.ca</a>, a partnered Canadian reseller of <a href="http://slingrings.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">slingrings.com</a>, which is pretty much the go-to place to get babywearing rings. They&#8217;re good because of their weight and because they aren&#8217;t welded together so they won&#8217;t risk tearing the fabric or irritating the baby &#8211; my baby used to like gnawing at the rings or sleeping against them. <strong>Currently, they have a 40% off sale too (Code: NovaScotia)</strong>, so it could be anywhere from $4.2 &#8211; $6 for a pair! I found the large rings made the Stilfull fabric easier to adjust, but also less grippy, so a pair of medium rings would probably work better once you&#8217;re used to how it feels.		</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				And, I hope it will be our last, and I hope this will the first and last time I have to call 911 for an emergency response. Come to think of it, that was his first time at a hospital too, since he was <a href="http://her.happyhippos.ca/2015/12/its-another-baby/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">born at home</a>.<br />
A couple of evenings ago, our little one had a <a href="http://kidshealth.org/en/parents/febrile.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">febrile seizure</a>. I didn&#8217;t know that was the name of it at the time, but I had two fleeting thoughts: &#8211; what was it that I read about seizures in young children during illness &#8211; was this it or something else? and &#8211; I hope I don&#8217;t have to ask for our hand-me-down baby clothes back. During the episode, I felt so helpless watching his limbs twitch, his eyes roll back repeatedly, and his lips turn blue. Shortly after we laid him down on the floor, during the call with dispatch, the seizure stopped but his eyes looked glassy, his gaze off in the distance; he fell asleep despite us talking to him and he didn&#8217;t even notice his sister jumping to get his attention. I cheered inside every time his chest rose up and then down, confirming that he was still breathing.<br />
And for those wondering:</p>
<h3>What was the ambulance ride like?</h3>
<p>The inside of an ambulance is surprisingly spacious, with ample room to seat at least 5 passengers with seat belts, and there&#8217;s a <a href="http://www.fernoems.com/en/search-results/pedi-mate.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">child-restraint system</a> for ambulance cots! Though, with rather limited windows and with the small view whizzing by when I tried to look out to see whether we were, I found myself getting a bit motion sick. We were the first call on their shift. As the ambulance door closed, I could only offer a weak smile to the neighbour who walked out to see what was going on (I found out later, they asked j.w if everything was okay and invited them over and offered to babysit if needed). If the $45 ambulance bill is not covered by OHIP or extended health, it&#8217;s a fairly reasonable cost: $755 cheaper than having a fire truck come on scene, and $35 cheaper than for one in our area in BC.</p>
<h3>What happened at the hospital?</h3>
<p>We were placed in our own room with a bed to rest on in the acute care department of the emergency ward  &#8211; I guess that&#8217;s one advantage of arriving via ambulance: <a href="http://www.grhosp.on.ca/care/services-departments/emergency/current-emergency-wait" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">you don&#8217;t have to sit in the waiting area</a> and deal with triage directly. His temperature was noted at 38.8C (which isn&#8217;t the highest it&#8217;s been). One of the paramedics instructed me to put him on the bed and wanted me to stand or sit in the chair, but thankfully, the nurses let me pick him up, which calmed him down (and kept him from falling off the bed!). For the most part, he wasn&#8217;t too miserable &#8211; I mean, you&#8217;d feel uncomfortable and probably want to cry too if they poked you, put you in some confining <a href="http://www.piggostat.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">x-ray contraption</a>, and put a catheter in you. The blood work showed low bicarbonate which may be related to his crazy <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f4a9.png" alt="💩" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> episodes in the past couple of days (diarrhea, the doctor thinks), and chest X-rays suggest something viral in the chest, possibly early pneumonia, which might have been from his cold a couple weeks back and could explain the wet cough they overheard. The doctor consulted the pediatrician and decided that no antibiotics were needed at this time since he&#8217;s still himself, for the most part anyway (thankfully because antibiotics can cause a bunch of side effects including yeast infection in the diaper area &#8211; but I&#8217;ve supplemented with probiotics anyway since he had diarrhea). Pee dip test came out clear. Overall, we had a nice mother-son bonding time once I was given the okay to pick him up and hold him.<br />
Despite us having to wait 5 hours for tests and results to come back, and with little updates unless I asked, towards the end of the evening, a nurse held my son while she faced the other way in the washroom so I could relieve my relatively full bladder, and even gave me a sandwich, some juice, and some fruit for us to eat, when I asked where I could buy some food to fill our rather empty stomachs (the little guy promptly fell asleep once he satisfied his hunger)[ref]this episode happened just as we were sitting down to eat dinner so we missed it[/ref].<br />
Towards the later parts of the evening, one distressed and very vocal fellow ended up in the same ward as us. One of the nurses told me that on weekends/Saturdays especially, and during later parts of the night, they often see people who don&#8217;t know where they are, or are elsewhere mentally because they&#8217;re either drunk or on way too much drugs, and sadly, the many of the latter are young people.<br />
PT took us home as it was late by the time we left and j.w had stayed home with Bean. Since then, DS has symptoms of a cold in addition to the fever, which comes and goes.<br />
Overall, I am very pleased with the response rate and care that we received the other night by Grand River hospital and by the paramedics.</p>
<h3>What are we to watch for now?</h3>
<p>The doctor instructed me to bring him back if he had another seizure within 24 hours, if we see him have any difficulty breathing, or if the fever doesn&#8217;t dissipate within 5 days. I was also advised to make a follow-up appointment with our family doctor the next week. If we notice less wet diapers, she suggested 1:1 apple juice to water ratio as a cheaper and tastier but equally effective alternative to pedialyte.</p>
<h3>Will it happen again? Does it affect their development? Will they get epilepsy?</h3>
<p>Sadly, the chances of another febrile seizure happening in the future is 1 in 3 (33%) now that he has had one. Both the internet and the doctor tells me that it&#8217;s fairly common in young children in response to a fever past 38C and it doesn&#8217;t seem to harm them. Our relatively laid-back child now has both allergy and febrile seizure risks (to balance out his easy-going nature?).  His chance of developing epilepsy according to the doctor is double, moving from 1% to 2%, which is still quite low: it won&#8217;t happen 98% of the time.</p>
<h3>What happened before all this started?</h3>
<p>Before the seizure, he seemed like his usual self, though he has seemed sad after every time he soiled his diaper for the past day or so (every one was was poopy) especially when I asked him about it, and he vomited once while crying on the toilet (I thought it was from crying, not from being sick). He hadn&#8217;t quite shaken his cough from a couple weeks back, but it didn&#8217;t seem to bother him and it was only on occasion, so I thought it was just residual coughing. He was maybe a touch warmer than usual, but I&#8217;m usually able to tell if he has a fever just by feel, so I&#8217;m not sure why I didn&#8217;t notice it; it probably didn&#8217;t help that he was wearing a wool cardigan. He woke up from his late nap after being transferred to j.w so I could make dinner, and shortly after j.w put him in the high chair, I heard, &#8220;I think he&#8217;s having a seizure&#8221;. I suggested moving him onto the ground (which the doctor assured me that was the right thing to do), called 911 since it was his first time and we weren&#8217;t sure what to do &#8211; I figured I could use the verbal coaching if I needed to do infant/baby/child CPR. He definitely felt and looked a lot hotter by the time the seizure stopped and woke up crying.</p>
<h3>What to expect if it happens again in your care?</h3>
<p>Start timing it &#8211; it&#8217;s probably going to feel longer than how much time has actually passed. Falling asleep is normal as long as breathing is happening, and as long as he is responsive and &#8220;comes out of it&#8221; within an hour of happening, it&#8217;s really nothing to be concerned about[ref]I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;m going to be concerned every time it happens anyway[/ref]. Put him down on the floor and turn his head to side in case he vomits. If the seizure continues for more than 4 minutes, call 911. If it doesn&#8217;t last for more than 10 minutes, we don&#8217;t need to bring him in to be assessed but since it takes a few minutes for the ambulance to come, preemptively calling them after 4 minutes is okay.  Paramedics advised us to strip him down to diaper to bring down his temperature as well. The pamphlet the hospital gave us also told us not to put him in a bath to bring down his temperature and don&#8217;t put anything in their mouths; they will not swallow their tongue. If he&#8217;s feverish, give him the correct dosage of Tylenol / Advil to avoid peaking over 38C.</p>
<h3>P.S. As usual, God&#8217;s fingerprint was all over this.</h3>
<p>He prepared me for this in two ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>I was supposed to be out that evening watching a movie with a friend but because I forgot to arrange the logistics with j.w (dinner, rides, car, etc.) and because the kids were still napping past the time, I missed it.</li>
<li>I have been on a long wait list for a LTE WiFi hotspot router from the library. My hold finally came up the day before this happened and j.w managed to pick it up for me. I was thinking, &#8220;I&#8217;m not going anywhere this week, why would I need internet on the go?&#8221; Well, he thought to throw it into my hospital bag as I was rushing out, and thankfully I had it because I wouldn&#8217;t have paid $10 for internet for the 5 hours that we were there. It enabled me to keep family and friends up-to-date, and I was encouraged to learn that so many were praying for us &#8211; and asking if we needed any help! Thank you, as always 🙂</li>
</ol>
<p>I pray we won&#8217;t experience this again, but if it does happen, at least I know what to expect -sort of; I feel one can never be &#8220;ready enough&#8221; to get married, to get pregnant, to have kids, and now to parent, but I know I&#8217;m never alone in this journey.		</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				While he was very stoic and mono-expression before, Little Brother is becoming quite the character, is generous with his smiles, and has quite the appetite.[ref]despite not going up to a week, sometimes! :([/ref]<br />
Some things he enjoys:</p>
<ul>
<li>he prefers soft veggies like squashes over green leafy vegetables (too stringy / fibrous), all soft meat &#8211; chicken, pork, but not steak, fish, and almost all fruits, especially oranges[ref]portion-wise, he eats the same amount as his sister now, if not more![/ref]</li>
<li>looking at the world upside down</li>
<li>studying younger babies</li>
<li>shrieking in laughter, especially when his sister eggs him on</li>
<li>plunking at keys (computer and piano keyboards)</li>
<li>building with Lego and cars (more so than his sister did, but maybe because his sister is more interested in them now)</li>
<li>looking at pictures in books, especially when on the toilet (he asks for them by pointing to where they are stored)</li>
<li>sneaking up the stairs (while we were unaware), climbing and standing on chairs (probably seeing his sister do that) &#8211; he&#8217;s definitely less cautious than his sister &#8211; maybe a combination of being a boy, a second-child, and his own personality differences</li>
<li>helping mommy unload the dishwasher &#8211; cutlery is his forte, though sometimes he will &#8220;help&#8221; unload his cup by doing quality control on it first and pretending to drink from it</li>
<li>playing with water, especially when washing his hands</li>
<li>toddling around (now that he&#8217;s walking around with a lot more confidence)</li>
</ul>
<p>Month 14 and 15 seemed pretty significant:</p>
<ul>
<li>he took his first unassisted steps at around the 14 month mark (2 months sooner than his sister)</li>
<li>2 week long cold/flu, where he spat up a couple of times, but it coincided when our house was sick last year as well</li>
<li>at his check-up, he weighed in as being on the 25th percentile (5x his sister!), around 50th percent in height, but 70th in head circumference (<em>not my genes!</em>); the doctor did comment that they are actually more interested in head circumference than length since a spike in the head size curve could mean a tumor or something unusual in there</li>
<li>figuring out how to drink properly from a sippy cup (and turning it over and tapping liquid from the unsealed ones all over the tray)</li>
<li>&#8220;painting&#8221;[ref]using a brush and water to bring color in a magic book[/ref] for the first time</li>
<li>mommy feeding him mixed nut butter (no peanuts) with no reaction the first time, but breaking out in hives and redness that required two doses of Benadryl to calm it down &#8211; <em>sigh</em>, more allergens to watch out for.</li>
</ul>
<p>The doctor says that he&#8217;s supposed to say about 20 words by now, but while he&#8217;s not there yet (probably 3-4 words he says independently), his vocabulary seems to have exploded over the past two months. Resignedly, many of them are in English (sigh) as he&#8217;s picking up what his sister often says:</p>
<ul>
<li>babbling, with first words at 14 months that seem to be associated with a meaning, but often copied instead of independently said, like &#8220;bao bao&#8221; (bread, but I realize that his meaning actually encompasses all food), &#8220;wow&#8221;, &#8220;POP&#8221; (goes the weasel), <em>mum mum</em> (food, not me) and now it extends to ow, snack, <em>woh woh </em>(dog), <em>mao mao </em>(cat)</li>
<li>signing more (food) by tapping all his fingers together, like in a teepee</li>
<li><em>nein nein</em>: wants mommy&#8217;s milk (that&#8217;s how he greets me now too, not mama &#8211; I&#8217;ve been reduced to breastmilk, sigh)</li>
<li><em>ma ma</em> (paternal grandmother) (15 months) paired with <em>yeh yeh</em> (paternal grandfather), which he had started calling long before <em>ma ma</em></li>
<li>using certain actions for certain songs, at certain parts of songs (like lifting his arms &#8220;when they&#8217;re up they&#8217;re up&#8221; for Grand Ol&#8217; Duke of York)</li>
<li>plays word games by repeating after you like counting from 1-5, but only saying 1 or 5 repeatedly: him: <em>YUT, </em>me: <em>yee, sam, say, </em>him: <em>NG; </em>sometimes he just says 5 or 1 before we even get there</li>
<li>he also understands what you say, like go get the ball, but even when you&#8217;re not talking to him (such as if I said to his sister, go wash your hands, he suddenly decides he wants to be done with his meal too, or I talk about shoes and he goes and grabs some)</li>
</ul>
<p>A bittersweet stage: <em>our little boy is growing up!</em>		</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				Today marks the end of steamed milk in my coffee, grilled cheese sandwiches, peanut butter pretzels and buttered popcorn, yogurt, ice cream, and other products containing milk, possibly soy, and peanuts in my diet until the end of our breastfeeding days, which&nbsp;might be for another year or more. While I only have to endure it until the end of our breastfeeding time together, our little one might have to watch his diet for the rest of his life &#8211; I&#8217;m sad for him, but at least he won&#8217;t have memories of enjoying those, so he may have less cravings for them, and hopefully better self-control (than I do!)[ref]I didn&#8217;t realize how much I regularly enjoy milk products until now, even though I don&#8217;t care for milk itself[/ref].&nbsp;<br />
I once suspected that milk might have been the culprit in his&nbsp;bouts of eczema and bloody stools[ref]though the latter might still be as a result of constipation[/ref], when he was known to spit up after every feeding (I would say mild reflux), and experienced three vomiting episodes after eating one serving of rice cereal that contained milk ingredients, but I was in denial; how could it be? My daily diet only consisted of milk in my one cup of espresso &#8211; or so I thought; I forgot about the cheese, ice cream, butter, everything else that has milk protein in it. I&#8217;m pretty sure I was in denial, so I didn&#8217;t&nbsp;cut anything in my diet, thinking that it wasn&#8217;t really an allergy, and like his sister, would outgrow it. Now, after a visit to an allergist and a positive prick/rash/allergy test, it&#8217;s official: he&nbsp;has a milk and peanut&nbsp;allergy.<br />
So now, our low-maintenance baby has become a high-maintenance one; I guess our &#8220;easy&#8221; baby was too good to be true. Yet, this news comes at a timely moment in our lives; we&#8217;re reading through&nbsp;<em>The Power of a Praying Parent</em> by Stormie Omartian (I keep thinking it&#8217;s &#8220;O&#8217;Martian&#8221;), and we just covered a chapter that talks about releasing our children to God, and this is an example of a very much an appropriate moment to follow her model of prayer: that if it&#8217;s in His will and in His time, that our son will outgrow both his allergies; but&nbsp;if not, will be managed well so that no one would ever need to use an epipen on him; but if so, that it is administered successfully and effectively.<br />
I&#8217;m still processing the news, so I didn&#8217;t get a chance to think of and ask the many follow-up questions that have since popped up (stemming from online research and what others have shared with me &#8211; yep, I&#8217;m also one of those internet moms), but here are some questions that people have asked and the answers I have come across:<br />
<strong>Q. Will he outgrow his&nbsp;allergy?<br />
A.&nbsp;</strong><a href="http://aacijournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1710-1492-7-S1-S7#Sec12" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Possibly</a>. Our allergist says that many children outgrow their milk allergy by the age of 5. I just found out&nbsp;that my siblings and I all had milk allergies until we were 1 years old, and our mother experimented by trying to reintroduce milk slowly and over time. However, only 20% of kids outgrow their peanut allergy. Because Bean seemed to have a milder reaction to peanut butter when she was younger, but outgrew it by 2 years old &#8211; which surprised him, the allergist suggested paying for a blood test to see if her brother&nbsp;would qualify for reintroduction of peanuts under clinical supervision; we&#8217;re praying that&nbsp;he&#8217;d be eligible. So, as of now, it is what it is &#8211; will just have to adapt to manage it.<br />
<strong>Q. How severe is his allergy?<br />
A.</strong> At the skin prick test, the one for peanuts was about 5mm, and the one for milk was slightly larger (6mm, maybe?); I think&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15482519" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the size indicates a positive diagnosi</a>s,&nbsp;but I didn&#8217;t think to ask. According to one site,&nbsp;&#8220;<a href="http://www.kidswithfoodallergies.org/page/food-allergy-test-diagnosis-skin-prick-blood.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">no test [&#8230;] can determine severity</a>&#8220;. Nevertheless,&nbsp;we&#8217;ve been advised to keep two epipens with him. While, I don&#8217;t know the criteria for what makes an allergy a risk for anaphylaxis, we have&nbsp;seen <a href="http://aacijournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1710-1492-7-S1-S6#Sec4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">symptoms matching the criteria in Table 3, section 2 (GI and skin symptoms)</a>&nbsp;and <a href="http://aacijournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1710-1492-7-S1-S6#Sec3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">in this table</a>.<br />
The allergist&nbsp;prescribed two injectors (<a href="http://www.kidswithfoodallergies.org/page/newly-diagnosed.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">as does this site</a>), but I think&nbsp;most people I know only carry one. Although he does not meet <a href="http://aacijournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1710-1492-10-40" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the minimum recommended weight of 15 KG (33 LBs)</a>, the allergist still recommended that over a self-administered antidote citing that human / user error is very common. He then used an ultrasound machine to measure the thickness of muscle between the skin and the bone, to make sure that our son&#8217;s thighs is fat enough &#8211; more than 13mm &#8211; <a href="http://aacijournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1710-1492-10-40#Sec2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">so that the injection won&#8217;t hit bone</a> (and bone marrow, which is equivalent to a IV administration and that&#8217;s bad); he was 16mm. Another option is available (TwinJet?) but is supposedly the same dose.<br />
<strong>Q. Is there no other option other than Epipen? What about Benadryl?</strong><br />
<strong>A. </strong>The allergist and online sources tells me that&nbsp;Benadryl won&#8217;t help with breathing, but it may help reduce other symptoms (e.g. puffy eyes, lips).<br />
<strong>Q. What can he drink instead of milk, to get the fat content and other nutrients that is in whole milk?<br />
A.&nbsp;</strong>My dietician and online sources say that breastmilk is best so to keep breastfeeding for as long as possible. As long as we have the go ahead to eat soy, we can also have soy and coconut milk; there&#8217;s rice and almond milk as well. I&#8217;ve tried hemp milk, and it tastes like grassy straw, which I&#8217;m not a fan of at all. Fortified alternatives provide at least 30% calcium and some fat content, but it doesn&#8217;t completely replace milk&#8217;s benefits; it&#8217;s also a shame that many companies use carrageenan (or xanthan gum, but not as bad) to thicken their drink, and add sea salt to flavour it. I have to remember to continue to supplement him with Vitamin D. For good fat, I will likely have to be more creative, using oils like avocado or olive, and serving more salmon (frozen filet steaks of wild Alaskan salmon is readily available from Kirkland / Costco year-round, works out to be 10$/lb which is reasonable)<br />
<strong>Q. What about formula?<br />
A.&nbsp;</strong>Online sources seem to suggest that if a baby has a milk allergy, baby may have a higher likelihood of developing a soy allergy, so switching to a soy based formula may end up increasing the risk.<br />
<strong>Q. Can he have lactose-free, cheese, or yogurt? What about goat&#8217;s or sheep&#8217;s milk?<br />
A.&nbsp;</strong>Unfortunately, the allergy is to the milk protein, not the lactose. Most people with milk allergy is to cow&#8217;s milk protein, but I&#8217;m not sure if we have the go-ahead to try other kinds of dairy.<br />
I did mention that I had accidentally fed him vegetables cooked in butter a couple of times and failed to see a reaction, to which he was surprised, so as a result, he told me keep to doing it, but don&#8217;t go beyond what I normally would have done. We will likely have to monitor him very, very closely if we do that &#8211; not to mention, we&#8217;ll have to watch&nbsp;him even more closely when we aren&#8217;t the ones providing his meal / food. Though, I wonder if he&nbsp;can tolerate <a href="https://aacijournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1710-1492-8-5#Sec1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">extreme heated milk products</a>&nbsp;&#8211; will have to ask.<br />
<strong>Q. Can he have other nuts?</strong><br />
A. In theory, yes. Peanuts is technically a legume and not a tree nut (e.g walnut, pecan), but we have to be careful of cross contamination because they may be processed in facility that isn&#8217;t peanut free.<br />
<strong>Q. What about peanut oil?</strong><br />
<strong>A.</strong> I&#8217;m not sure about this one. Online sources say that pure unrefined peanut oil should be safe, but I need to check with the allergist about this one. Will likely have to avoid though,&nbsp;especially in commercial places, like restaurants &#8211; because can you be sure that it&#8217;s pure and unrefined?<br />
<strong>Q. So, are you a peanut and dairy-free household now?</strong><br />
<strong>A.</strong> Thankfully, complete elimination measures aren&#8217;t necessary at this time. In fact, the allergist told us specifically not to stop giving our daughter peanut butter! However,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.hamiltonhealthsciences.ca/documents/Patient%20Education/CowMilkProteinAllergyWhatToEatBreastfeeding-trh.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mom will also need to follow a similar elimination diet</a>, which will be a challenge, as she can&#8217;t eat anything from the allium family either (e.g garlic, onions, chives, leeks).<br />
<strong>Q.</strong> <strong>What can I do to help?</strong><br />
<strong>A.</strong> Pray for us &#8211; I (we) have no idea what I&#8217;m (we&#8217;re) doing. Trying to avoid garlic, onions, etc. is already hard; I&#8217;m also thinking that avoiding dairy will likely be more challenging than peanuts. And, if you eat with us, we especially appreciate that you take our dietary needs into consideration &#8211; understandably, it&#8217;s probably&nbsp;especially hard if you&nbsp;don&#8217;t need to conscientious of it in your everyday life; I&#8217;m sorry for the inconvenience. If you&#8217;re in a similar family situation, I&#8217;m open to hearing advice and your experiences too. Thank you!		</p>

				<description><![CDATA[My first experience seeing a Chinese (herbal) doctor didn&#8217;t fit my mental image of the &#8220;doctor&#8221; being an middle-aged or older Chinese man who wants your money, perhaps in a white wife-beater and/or a lab coat on top with black, round-rimmed, acetate glasses, who sells herbs at an herbal shop in a Chinese mall or Chinatown and does double duty by acting as a &#8220;doctor&#8221;, one who brings you to the back of the room, looks at your problem and weighs out some dried herbs for you to make and drink at home.

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				My first experience seeing a Chinese (herbal) doctor didn&#8217;t fit my mental image of the &#8220;doctor&#8221; being an middle-aged or older Chinese man who wants your money, perhaps in a white wife-beater and/or a lab coat on top with black, round-rimmed, acetate glasses, who sells herbs at an herbal shop in a Chinese mall or Chinatown and does double duty by acting as a &#8220;doctor&#8221;, one who brings you to the back of the room, looks at your problem and weighs out some dried herbs for you to make and drink at home. I don&#8217;t even know where that image comes from, but this Chinese female doctor looked younger than expected, and she had an independent practice, specializing in acupuncture it seems, with consulting rooms and a receptionist inside (irony is that their were drapes that looked like shower curtains that covered the windows to convey a sense of privacy, but if you looked up, a surveillance camera points at you).<br />
The packets say Chinese Herbal Tea, but we were instructed to bathe the baby in it for 20 minutes every other day, one set a day. Let me tell you that bathing a baby for 20 minutes isn&#8217;t easy, especially if said baby can&#8217;t sit up on its own and you&#8217;re trying not to dilute the concentration by adding more warm water to keep the temperature. We were provided with that and a small container of non-identifiable, no label topical cream to be applied 2-3 times a day; this cream along with the expected herbal scent, has a pink tinge to it and it almost smells like roses (rosehip, rose water, rose geranium?)[ref]further Google research suggests that peony might be effective in the fight against eczema and it does have a light rose scent[/ref]. At least the container is a dark brown one, which means its meant to keep light out so the active ingredients don&#8217;t break down as quickly. I am skeptical of mystery &#8220;magical&#8221; products like these and especially since they&#8217;re from China (who knows what it could be tainted with &#8211; lead? mercury?), but I appreciated that each packet of &#8220;spice&#8221; contained the name and amount, most foreign to me except one or two I recognized:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.americandragon.com/Individualherbsupdate/DiYu.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Radix Sanguisorbae</a> (1.2g extracted from 10g): targets liver, large intestine; cooling properties (I&#8217;m guessing that may also extend to anti-itch and reducing inflamed areas)</li>
<li>Herba Portulacae (1.8g extracted from 15g): targets liver, large intestine</li>
<li>Fructus Kochiae (0.9g extracted from 10g): targets kidney, bladder; alleviates itching</li>
<li>Radix Sophorae Flavescentis (0.6g extracted from 6g): targets liver, intestine; alleviates itching</li>
<li><a href="https://tcmwiki.com/wiki/radix-et-rhizoma-rhei" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Radix Et Rhizoma Rhei</a> (0.6g extracted from 3g): targets large intestine; also known as rhubarb!</li>
<li><a href="http://tcmwiki.com/wiki/pericarpium-zanthoxyli" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pericarpium Zanthoxyli</a> (0.6g extracted from 6g): targets stomach; relieves itching (perhaps because of the numbing properties? the Chinese name &#8220;hua jiao&#8221; reminded me of this tongue numbing prickly heat sauce that my parents have in their cupboards, which I often associate with sichuan peppers)</li>
<li><a href="http://tcmwiki.com/wiki/folium-isatidis" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Folium Isatidis</a> (0.9g of 10g): targets liver and stomach</li>
</ul>
<p>So the common theme seems to be a heat-expelling formula that targets the digestive system, which seems to be in-line with western natural wellness thinking &#8211; that eczema is a symptom of what&#8217;s going on in your gut / digestive system / with your digestion, often a sign of food sensitivities or allergies. This also seems to match what another Chinese herbal remedies site suggests about common formulas[ref]. Wonder if this kind of &#8220;heat&#8221; is the same as &#8220;hot air&#8221;-associated foods like chocolate (she did say not to have any), chips, crustaceans, deep-fried oily food. And would eating &#8220;cooling&#8221; foods like watermelon, cucumber, bittermelon help with baby&#8217;s skin then?<br />
<strong>&#8220;Formulas that clear heat</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Clear heat and reduce fire</li>
<li>Clear heat and eliminate toxins</li>
<li>Clear heat and purge lung fire</li>
<li>Cleanse liver and resolves toxicity</li>
<li>Clear dampness-heat in liver and bladder</li>
<li>Clear dampness-heat in intestines and stomach&#8221;</li>

I think I would still prefer naturopathic doctors (ND) over Chinese doctors (CMD) because it seems NDs take more time to explain (treatment, etc.) and look at the lifestyle as a whole, even though I know that Chinese medicine is probably even more holistic (and mystical to me) if you look at the body&#8217;s qi, etc.; it is also nice that extended health insurance covers the services of a ND (probably because they are registered and governed by a body), but not of a CMD. Would I have seen a Chinese doctor for my baby&#8217;s eczema without nudging from my mother-in-law? Probably not. Especially not because of the cost and because we are already seeing a dermatologist (and thus East meets or conflicts with West?) and because our first outgrew most of hers. Admittedly, with only one treatment so far, it seems to be more effective in speedy results compared with the continued steroid / cortisone use (which I don&#8217;t want to rely on anyway); I just don&#8217;t know if there are going to be side effects or if the problem will come back and I wasn&#8217;t told what the products would do so it feels like she expects me to trust her in blind faith. I know baby skin and bodies are just so much more sensitive than our adult ones, and because it absorbs everything like a sponge and their little systems are still growing, I still have reservations on whether we made the right choice &#8211; maybe it&#8217;s an answered prayer since it coincided around the same time. So maybe the $220+ will be worthwhile ($100 for consultation fee, $50 for the packets and $70 cream&#8230;<em>yipes</em>), but maybe not. I guess like all areas where I have little knowledge in, this is where some faith comes into play; I may have faith in God, but I trust him so it comes easier than faith in mankind.		</p>

While I usually welcome routine and structure,&nbsp;I feel&nbsp;like I am&nbsp;wasting my days&nbsp;away&nbsp;in too&nbsp;much routine lately, to the point where every day feels the same.&nbsp;Perhaps it&#8217;s cabin fever from postpartum confinement&nbsp;that seems like time is dragging,&nbsp;and yet, he&#8217;s almost three weeks old, and I only have 10ish days left before I can freely leave the house (without feeling guilty or lectured at) whether to get some fresh air or a change in environment.<br />
Even with help, I&#8217;m feeling drained and spent; I don&#8217;t know how single&nbsp;parents or&nbsp;those whose spouses&nbsp;are away do it &#8211; kudos to them. One huge advantage of the postpartum confinement practice is the help: I can get away from not having to do dishes, cook meals, change as many diapers,&nbsp;and entertain the toddler so I can&nbsp;feed the baby on demand,&nbsp;&nbsp;get some shut-eye to make up for the little sleep I get at night. When help &#8211; in the form of either set of parents &#8211; leaves, I worry most about how to juggle the sleep schedules&nbsp;with two (bad parenting habits on our part&nbsp;as some would say, as the toddler requires too much help to fall asleep). I also hope I can figure out a way to connect with my daughter again because right now, I feel like mommy doesn&#8217;t have fun with her anymore; instead, mommy is just around to help her do things (like change diapers, feed her, bedtime routine, take her to the toilet, wash her hands) &#8211; which is probably why she&#8217;s even more resistant to other people helping her do these things these days, and would on occasion&nbsp;breakdown or have an outburst as a result.<br />
Lately, a typical day looks like: <span style="color: #008000;">feed baby</span>, <span style="color: #008000;">change diaper</span>, <span style="color: #ff9900;">eat a meal</span>, <span style="color: #ff00ff;">feed toddler</span>, <span style="color: #008000;">feed baby</span>,&nbsp;<span style="color: #ff00ff;">put toddler&nbsp;down for a nap (short bedtime routine)</span>, <span style="color: #ff9900;">power nap or laundry</span>, <span style="color: #008000;">feed baby</span>, <span style="color: #ff00ff;">tend to toddler who has woken up within the hour</span>, <span style="color: #800080;">change diapers on both</span>, <span style="color: #ff9900;">eat another meal</span>, <span style="color: #ff00ff;">feed toddler</span>,<span style="color: #008000;"> feed baby</span>, <span style="color: #ff00ff;">persuade the toddler to fall sleep (long bedtime routine)</span>, <span style="color: #008000;">feed&nbsp;baby</span>, <span style="color: #ff9900;">some down time and snacks</span>, and repeat the following until the morning:&nbsp;<span style="color: #008000;">feed baby</span>,&nbsp;<span style="color: #ff9900;">nap</span>, <span style="color: #008000;">feed baby</span>,&nbsp;<span style="color: #008000;">change diaper</span>, <span style="color: #008000;">feed baby</span>,<span style="color: #ff00ff;"> settle&nbsp;toddler</span>. (<span style="color: #008000;">green</span>: baby, <span style="color: #ff9900;">orange</span>: me, <span style="color: #ff00ff;">pink</span>: toddler)<br />
Nights are the hardest because when I&#8217;m not sleeping, I silently will&nbsp;my&nbsp;husband to share in&nbsp;misery&nbsp;instead of&nbsp;serenely sleeping away or wonder why my toddler&nbsp;can&#8217;t easily&nbsp;be consoled by&nbsp;daddy when she wakes up&nbsp;in the middle of the night (and decides to cry for an hour instead). &nbsp;I know these aren&#8217;t very nice (or godly) thoughts&nbsp;and I know it gets better eventually, but it doesn&#8217;t mean that they escape me.&nbsp;There has been a week of reprieve, where he actually followed a nice 2-3 hour feeding schedule, and slept nicely in between.&nbsp;<del>Sadly, it didn&#8217;t last and&nbsp;was too good to be true.</del>&nbsp; At the time I started writing this post,&nbsp;he decided to feed every 1-2 hours nightly for a few days likely due to a growth spurt, but last night, it was nice to be back on a 2-3 hour sleep cycle again (funny how 2-3 hours is what to look forward these days). Though, it&#8217;s nice to have caught up with my Netflix playlist as a result.<br />
The past few weeks have gone by quickly in terms of baby&#8217;s growth: he lost 10% of his birth weight, but recovered 1 kg within a week. Perhaps it&#8217;s because the midwife wisely waited until he grew a bit before doing the heel poke&nbsp;for the newborn tests, but he didn&#8217;t even flinch or cry when she drew blood.&nbsp;While he easily tucked into my arms before, his feet now stick out when he&#8217;s feeding. He gurgles and snorts and makes all sorts of funny expressions and noises, and while he slept through all sorts of background noises the second week, it seems like he&#8217;s&nbsp;starting to want to be held more during the day. He&#8217;s also prone to burp and regularly spit up (even from his nose, poor guy), which I guess makes up for all the two times Bean did.<br />
This is why babies are hard work! I&#8217;m reminded why I started to enjoy being with and interacting with Bean more&nbsp;after she was 6 months old &#8211; by then, I probably would have a better hang of things&nbsp;with two as well.		</p>
