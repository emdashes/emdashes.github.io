<p>We started our cruise and ended our cruise in Venice, so we had to look for accomodations as a result. Because hotels can get pretty pricey, we settled on some short-term apartment rentals (&#8220;bed and breakast&#8221; type accomodations, but with the place to ourselves and no hot breakfast).</p>
<p>The accomodations were pretty liveable, but with one major complaint: mosquitoes. I&#8217;m not sure if it&#8217;s because our rooms were on the ground floor (next to the canals), or because the windows were open before we checked in. If that wasn&#8217;t a problem, I think I preferred the second place more: our host at Casa dei Pittori&#65279;&nbsp;met us at an easy-to-find spot, recommended some really good eats nearby (Rio Marin for their light pasteries and Alaska for their gelato: the ginger one especially wasn&#8217;t too sweet and had real pieces of ginger in it!), and was able via phone to answer any of our questions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<a title="IMG_1532 by b.p., on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aimeili/6184087886/"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6179/6184087886_6ef486d05c.jpg" alt="IMG_1532" width="400" height="266" /></a>&#65279;</p>
<p>Because we had wandered around in Venice for two days prior to this trip, we ended up hitting all the popular spots on the first day, and then spent one day in Murano, the glass-making island. In fact, we ended up going to Murano after the cruise, and had gone into a shop that was recommended by NCL. However, they had no open tours, but after speaking to a manager, he let us sneak into the hot workshop and watch the glass blower make a few pieces; he was an older man, likely weathered by the heat and ashes from what comes with the job. The glass and their designs in Murano and Venice seem clearer and more intricate than what I see on this side of the world, but it&#8217;s sad to hear that the majority of it is a copy from a template brought from Venice to China &#8211; and most of us can&#8217;t tell the difference.</p>
<p>What not to eat in Venice? I was brave and tried the black-squid ink pasta, but tomato based pasta is the way to go! This is not your typical &#8220;Italian&#8221; tomato sauce-based pasta with meatballs, but a simple dish with pieces of tomatoes and herbs like basil. Pizza isn&#8217;t necessarily a recommended item in Venice, but regardless of where we had it, it was heaps better than the types of pizza here &#8211; in fact, the pizza I had in Washington, DC (7 Hill) reminded me of the pizza we had in Venice. There is a warning though: be careful of where you eat in Venice &#8211; there are places where you sit on the side of the canal, and it seems relatively cheap? Well, think fast-food, but more like Michelena&#8217;s &#8211; frozen entrees that they reheat and serve to you.</p>
<p><a title="IMG_1600 by b.p., on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aimeili/6184102288/"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6174/6184102288_c19facdfb8.jpg" alt="IMG_1600" width="400" height="266" /></a></p>
<p>What has changed since our last visit? Venice now has a people mover, which is a monorail that moves people from town into the port for 1 euro each way; it saves about 10 minutes dragging your luggage. We asked our host about it, and he mentioned that it was only installed within the last couple of years. Cheaper quality gelato is now also 30 euro cents more than what it was before (1.30 euro vs. 1 euro), and this time, the weather seemed to be hotter than last. Thankfully, it didn&#8217;t really rain until the morning of our departure. So what do people do with seven days in Venice? We pretty much had a good taste of it in a couple.</p>

<p>While I enjoyed the scenery of Croatia, j.w certainly enjoyed the most historical spots: Athens, Greece; and Ephesus (Izmir), Turkey. While we both like ruins, I think these places were more special because of the biblical significance of these spots.</p>
<blockquote><p>While Paul was waiting for them in Athens, he was greatly distressed to see that the city was full of idols. So he reasoned in the synagogue with the Jews and the God-fearing Greeks, as well as in the marketplace day by day with those who happened to be there. A group of Epicurean and Stoic philosophers began to dispute with him. Some of them asked, &#8220;What is this babbler trying to say?&#8221; Others remarked, &#8220;He seems to be advocating foreign gods.&#8221; They said this because Paul was preaching the good news about Jesus and the resurrection. Then they took him and brought him to a meeting of the Areopagus, where they said to him, &#8220;May we know what this new teaching is that you are presenting? You are bringing some strange ideas to our ears, and we want to know what they mean.&#8221; (All the Athenians and the foreigners who lived there spent their time doing nothing but talking about and listening to the latest ideas.) </p>
<p> Paul then stood up in the meeting of the Areopagus and said: &#8220;Men of Athens! I see that in every way you are very religious. For as I walked around and looked carefully at your objects of worship, I even found an altar with this inscription: TO AN UNKNOWN GOD. Now what you worship as something unknown I am going to proclaim to you. </p>
<p> &#8220;The God who made the world and everything in it is the Lord of heaven and earth and does not live in temples built by hands. And he is not served by human hands, as if he needed anything, because he himself gives all men life and breath and everything else. From one man he made every nation of men, that they should inhabit the whole earth; and he determined the times set for them and the exact places where they should live. God did this so that men would seek him and perhaps reach out for him and find him, though he is not far from each one of us. &#8216;For in him we live and move and have our being.&#8217; As some of your own poets have said, &#8216;We are his offspring.&#8217;&nbsp;&#8211; Acts 17:16-28 (NIV 1984)&#65279;</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;While I know that Ephesus is home to a church that Paul ministers to, and spends significant time in, I didn&#8217;t realize that Areopagus, aka Mars Hill, was THE mound of rock that my brother and j.w ventured up to explore and get a better view of the Parthenon. Had I have known, I probably would&#8217;ve joined them and used my imagine to picture what it was like in the day, instead of resting on a bench at the bottom of the hill under some shade to cool off.</p>
<p>And for those who laugh at ARTS students, here&#8217;s a bonus for me: upon showing the staff my student ID, she noticed the ARTS label on it and told me it was free for arts students, despite me not being in fine arts, or history. Sweet! (students do get half off, but I guess arts students get an added benefit).</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p><a title="IMG_1164 by b.p., on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aimeili/6182523393/"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6156/6182523393_b29286f274.jpg" alt="IMG_1164" width="400" height="266" /></a></p>
<p>On one of the stops on our Ephesus excursion, we stopped by what is known as &#8220;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_the_Virgin_Mary" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the House of the Virgin Mary</a>&#8220;. This site is purportedly&#65279; the house that Mary, the mother of Jesus was taken care of by St. John after Jesus&#8217; death. It seemed like any old restored house, with shorter frames for the doorways, and a serene path that leads to it &#8211; what was really striking though, was not the house, or holy spring water that came from a faucet, but the wall of wishes. People would write their burdens and prayers on a tissue, or any scrap paper and tie it to the wall, in the hopes that their prayers are answered. One even came from a younger child pleading for her parents to stop fighting, which was quite sad and moving.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In September, we went on another Mediterranean cruise, this time beginning and ending in Venice with the company of my parents and my brother.</p>
<p>Because of time restrictions, we chose a 7-day cruise with the Norwegian Jade (NCL). Compared to the Carnival Dream, the Jade was a lot smaller, much simpler, and we had less activities to choose from to pass time while on board/at sea. NCL, however, has better live shows (entertainment) than the Dream and it allows you to have a much more flexible schedule, so you can dine when you want and where you want, with very little restrictions on the dress code.</p>
<p>We got chatting with a few of the crew members on board, and found out that many of them come from less-wealthy countries, leave their families behind and work on board for over 9 months, with long hours each day. One 20 year old young man started telling us about his family and he teared up just thinking that he would see them in 2 months.</p>
<p><a title="IMG_0591 by b.p., on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aimeili/6182834704/"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6151/6182834704_08bf835c74.jpg" alt="IMG_0591" width="400" height="266" /></a></p>
<p>Once again, Croatia was one of my favourite ports that we stopped at &#8211; both Dubrovnik (above) and Split (below). We had beautiful weather, with blue skies and sunny days, despite it being very hot (hotter than our last trip). NCL also tendered at the port, so we didn&#8217;t have to walk half an hour before reaching the old town, which was a great bonus!</p>
<p><a title="IMG_1369 by b.p., on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aimeili/6184005224/"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6172/6184005224_964fffe9a6.jpg" alt="IMG_1369" width="400" height="266" /></a></p>
<p>Split is probably known for their abundance of lavender; both cities sell potpurri packets filled with lavender, but it was in Split that we came across plants that were very fragrant &#8211; turns out they were fresh lavender plants!</p>
<p><a title="IMG_1428 by b.p., on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aimeili/6184064530/"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6159/6184064530_e74ce8509d_m.jpg" alt="IMG_1428" width="160" height="240" align="right" /></a>It was also in Split that we happened upon a rather deserted restaurant called Luna Cafe that looked rather pricey. However, we all tried the local beer and the seafood was probably the freshest that I had in a very long while, and the price was worth it! j.w enjoyed a <strong>kilogram</strong>of mussels (~$15?), which wasn&#8217;t fishy at all, and my mother and I split a whole pan-fried fish seasoned with some sea salt ($30).&#65279;</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This past weekend will likely be one of the most eventful weekends in 2010; it marked the start of the Winter Olympics, Chinese (Lunar) New Year, Valentine&#8217;s Day (for some), Reading Week for the students, and an extra long weekend for some provinces (Family Day)!</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aimeili/4371112200/" title="IMG_1696 by b.p., on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4053/4371112200_55c50db5eb_m.jpg" width="160" height="240" alt="IMG_1696" /></a></p>
<h3>Sights</h3>
<p>For us, we went back to Europe, despite it being only a short three day trip (well it spanned 5 dates, but 1 red-eye and 1 day spent flying).  <a href="http://www.redflagdeals.com/deals/main.php/alldeals/comments/air_france_toronto_montreal_ottawa_round_trip_to_paris_barcelona_rome_from" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">This was a impulse buy</a>: no refunds, and I had forgotten that I was taking a course (thankfully it was reading week). We didn&#8217;t intentionally plan to come because of Valentine&#8217;s &#8211; we had wanted to take advantage of Family Day, as one of us didn&#8217;t have enough vacation days. But yes, we spent Valentine&#8217;s Day at the Eiffel tower, but I&#8217;m not sure I see the romanticism in waiting in line to climb up the tall steel structure, or seeing the tower itself. In fact, we didn&#8217;t even go to the top because the lines were too incredibly long (even if you paid to walk up the stairs to the 2nd platform, you&#8217;d have to wait a minimum of 2 hours to get to the top via elevator from there). Actually, going for a carousel ride in front of the Eiffel tower seemed even more romantic! The other major places we visited were the Louvre, Notre Dame, and Arc de Triomphe, with a stroll down Champs Elysees from the Concorde, exploring the Catacombs, food shopping at La Galeries Lafayette, and a half a day in Versailles. I simply enjoyed exploring the streets and sampling the many foods I normally wouldn&#8217;t eat.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aimeili/4370365539/" title="IMG_2026 by b.p., on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4010/4370365539_24e92cf60c.jpg" width="270" height="180" alt="IMG_2026" /></a><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_InBf17rbs_c/S36FPmd4A-I/AAAAAAAAEsk/XMpibo9GrEY/s576/IMG_1829.JPG" width="123" height="180"  /></p>
<h3>People</h3>
<p>Our visit this time around felt more familiar to me &#8211; the graffiti on the walls surrounding the train tracks, the way the streets were structured and the number of small compact cars on the road reminded me of our last trip. Despite Rome having more architectural history, I think I like Paris more. Perhaps it is because the language was familiar enough to us (we could use elementary level French and didn&#8217;t have to resort to English unless absolutely necessary), or because the Parisians seemed more polite; accidental bumps always resulted in a &#8220;pardon&#8221; (sometimes an &#8220;excusez-moi&#8221;). Upon entering a store or a restaurant, one would be greeted by a &#8220;bonjour&#8221; or a &#8220;bonsoir&#8221;. I can&#8217;t pinpoint it exactly, but Paris feels more graceful or &#8220;light&#8221; than Quebec in some ways (and here I am thinking that if I stayed long enough, I would eventually pick up the language). Even the unsolicited buskers are creative in getting money &#8211; they jump onto the metro, play a few tunes on their accordians (and one even sang) before collecting tips; maybe it&#8217;s their passion in everything.</p>
<p>(Just listen to the accordion players!)<br />

</p>
<h3>Eats</h3>
<p>In Paris, it&#8217;s normal to see people walking around with a baguette in their hands, and no wonder, their baked goods, pastries, and desserts were almost always good. Actually, it&#8217;s funny because I found that &#8220;french&#8221; food didn&#8217;t have to be fancy (unlike French restaurants around here) and it tasted good; it was normal to have duck confit served with fries, crepes that you could grab on a street like a beavertail or in a restaurant (without the fancy fresh fruit toppings), or a plate of boiled potatoes and some slices of cheese (you melt the cheese on a metal plate and scrape it onto the potatoes) <a href="http://www.berthillon.fr/mag/fr/page-112620.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The best ice cream</a> in Paris was closed (Mondays and Wednesdays), so we settled on getting a tiny scoop of the same brand in a neighbouring bar. I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve ever had ice cream like it.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aimeili/4370366381/" title="IMG_2105 by b.p., on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4050/4370366381_a95c2afbae_m.jpg" width="200" height="133" alt="IMG_2105" /></a><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aimeili/4370380211/" title="IMG_2522 by b.p., on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2731/4370380211_e987fb7393_m.jpg" width="200" height="133" alt="IMG_2522" /></a></p>
<p>The only horror is that servers simply take the bread from your basket that you don&#8217;t finish and put them into another basket for another table. And despite macarons looking so artificial and sweet, they were light and just melted in your mouth (the best one being the green matcha tea and the black sesame one that was 1.85 euro *edit: Google maps+Google helped me identify that it was at Pierre Hermé on Champs-Elysées, apparently just as famous as Ladurée which we didn&#8217;t know at the time* &#8211; normally they were 1.5 euro). Although pastries and dessert were expensive, I found that eating out, including fixed menus were more reasonable than in Italy &#8211; at least the gratuities and cover were all inclusive. And to save even more, you just needed to ask for a carafe of water (thanks to pre-trip research).</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aimeili/4371117788/" title="IMG_2172pp by b.p., on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2753/4371117788_906e38418b.jpg" width="400" height="282" alt="IMG_2172pp" /></a></p>
<h3>Tourists</h3>
<p>Even though it was low season (cold!), the lines were long if you didn&#8217;t get there at the beginning of the day. Many students were off and Japanese tourists were everywhere with many tour groups, especially at Versailles. I&#8217;m never impressed at the tourists who try to cut into the queues, or the ones who don&#8217;t respect signs or people telling them that flash photography isn&#8217;t allowed. And maybe because it was cold (cloudy) that it affected the tone of my photos &#8211; the photos turned out disappointingly grey and definitely not as vibrant as the ones I captured in Europe last fall; they certainly reflected the &#8220;winter&#8221; feel. The climate though feels more like Vancouver winters than Ontario ones; it hovers around zero but mild enough to get around in a wool jacket, scarf, and boots, without having to worry about wearing North Face or Columbia jackets. In fact, the only people we ever saw wearing them were &#8230; tourists.</p>

<p>Random geek-speak: Anvers is a metro station in Paris and they pronounce it &#8220;On-veir&#8221;; I&#8217;ve been pronouncing the font name wrong all along! Also, on our way to Versailles, we passed by a Microsoft building and other modern buildings. I thought to myself, maybe this area is like the technology area. Well, at the Issy-Val de Seine stop, all these people got off the train!</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll leave off with a clip from our worship service at the American Church of Paris. And, maybe I should re-listen to the sermon, since I zoned out (after a red-eye) and didn&#8217;t quite understand the connection between King David, Valentine&#8217;s and accepting Christ.<br />

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For 2 weeks, I experienced plenty of firsts, including my first cruise on a non-Asian cruise line, and first my time in Europe. Suffice to say, I found that cruising was a great way to enjoy Europe: you wake up in a new destination (almost) every day!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aimeili/3987211710/" title="IMG_7663p by b.p., on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2484/3987211710_9ec4740a19.jpg" width="400" height="247" alt="IMG_7663p" /></a></p>
<p>Other thoughts?</p>
<ul>
<li>My favourite destination was Cinque Terre, a region in Italy that comprises of 5 villages on coastal mountains. To get to each one, one can take a train, ferry, or walk on the trail that connects them. The colourful houses in this area reminded me of&#8230;.Newfoundland! Since this trip, I have concluded that we take Canada for granted quite easily. For instance, Tofino reminds me of Hawaii, Quebec City and Montreal reminds me of Europe (now I can say that with certainty &#8211; in fact, when we were in Nice, I accidentally said to a fellow traveller that we went to Old Quebec when I meant to say Old Nice!)</li>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aimeili/3986462479/" title="IMG_8255 by b.p., on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3496/3986462479_7d77a46d56.jpg" width="400" height="266" alt="IMG_8255" /></a></p>
<li>Dubrovnik, Croatia was a second favourite &#8211; the coastal city was beautiful, with the red roofs and mostly because I wasn&#8217;t expecting too much (despite my physiotherapist&#8217;s assistant telling me so, who is from that side of Europe). I guess it&#8217;s just not a top destination that you hear many tourists talk about (unlike Rome, Florence, Venice).
</li>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aimeili/3986233640/" title="IMG_7486 by b.p., on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2640/3986233640_99c3c906af.jpg" width="400" height="266" alt="IMG_7486" /></a></p>
<li>While j.w liked Rome because of its history, I wasn&#8217;t too fond of it not because it was old, but because it was dirty (graffiti and poo everywhere &#8211; not just dog poo), and by extension smelly. It reminded me of some Asian cities.</li>
<li>Dogs and cats seem to freely wander the streets of Italy and Croatia. So if you are afraid of them, then be warned.</li>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aimeili/3986249796/" title="IMG_7784 by b.p., on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3467/3986249796_75d4dd5c70.jpg" width="400" height="266" alt="IMG_7784" /></a></p>
<li>Train strikes in Italy seem to be random! They can decide to strike for no apparent reason and have it start mid-day and end by 9PM. Thankfully, when that happened, the local buses were running and they ran an extra one to shuttle the tourists to Taormina, which cost the same as the train (6.5 euros roundtrip), but it actually took us to the top (where Taormina is situated). The public transportation system in Europe is just so affordable &#8211; the subway is 1 euro one way, (water) buses and trains are inexpensive too. (e.g. KW< ->TO would be $10 RT).</li>
<li>3-star hotels are more like the standards of 2-star hotels here.</li>
<li>I was sadly disappointed with the locals in Barcelona, Spain. The city is seemingly multi-cultural, yet I heard racist remarks directed at us twice! However, at the market, their fresh fruit drinks (like dragonfruit mango or pineapple mango) are sooo delicious and inexpensive. We shared 3  (3 euro total).</li>
<li>Dining in Europe is ridiculously expensive &#8211; especially if the place has a cover charge for each person (up to 3.5 euros each!) &#8211; the last meal in Rome, we spent $70 CD for a salad, an entree, plus 1 coffee. Ouch.</li>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aimeili/3987217396/" title="IMG_8344 by b.p., on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2454/3987217396_4f74048dae.jpg" width="400" height="266" alt="IMG_8344" /></a></p>
<li>Travelling on a inaugural cruise is a great experience &#8211; you get to experience everything new for the first time, including new board games (no grimey fingers) and wrinkle free books to borrow!</li>
<li>And, of course, gelato can be as low as 1 euro for 1 scoop in a cone &#8211; which works out to be about $1.64 CD.</li>
</ul>
