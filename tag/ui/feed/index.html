Originally posted: November 16, 2010 | Revisited today as it's still a good reminder since we're using mobile more so than ever.
I came across a <a href="http://www.lukew.com/presos/preso.asp?26">presentation on mobile design by Luke Wroblewski</a> on the web. I often reference his book <a href="http://rosenfeldmedia.com/books/webforms/info/table_of_contents/"><em>Web Form Design</em></a><em> </em>in my library when designing and reviewing web forms in many of our web applications.
In the presentation, he covered many mobile design considerations, some of which are will be covered in a future post. Here are some specifics:


<h2><strong>Touch Targets</strong></h2>


This is the area where your thumbs or fingers may overlap beyond the target button or control. Some recommendations:


<ul>
    

<li><strong>minimum target size:</strong> 29px wide/44px tall (Apple)</li>


    

<li><strong>recommended touch target size:</strong> 9mm/34px (Windows Phone)</li>


    

<li><strong>minimum touch target size:</strong> 7mm/26px (Windows Phone)</li>


</ul>




<h2><strong>Touch Gestures</strong></h2>


After going through some phone platforms that support multi-touch such as iPhone, Android, Windows, and BlackBerry 6, he groups these as being the common core basic gestures among them:


<ul>
    

<li><strong>Tap:</strong> briefly touch surface with fingertip(s)</li>


    

<li><strong>Double tap:</strong> rapidly touch surface twice with fingertip</li>


    

<li><strong>Drag:</strong> move fingertip(s) over surface without losing contact</li>


    

<li><strong>Flick:</strong> quickly brush surface with fingertip</li>


    

<li><strong>Pinch:</strong> touch surface with two fingers and bring them close together</li>


    

<li><strong>Spread:</strong> touch surface with two (or all) fingers and move them apart</li>


    

<li><strong>Press:</strong> touch surface for an extended period of time</li>


    

<li><strong>Press &amp; tap:</strong> touch surface with one finger and briefly touch surface with a second finger</li>


    

<li><strong>Press &amp; drag:</strong> touch surface with one finger and move second finger over surface without losing contact (using one or both hands)</li>


    

<li><strong>Rotate:</strong> touch surface with two fingers (using one or both hands) and move them in a clockwise or counterclockwise direction</li>


</ul>




<h2><strong>Common system actions</strong></h2>




<ul>
    

<li><strong>Change mode:</strong> press</li>


    

<li><strong>Open:</strong> double tap</li>


    

<li><strong>Select:</strong> tap</li>


    

<li><strong>Delete:</strong> drag (across item or off-screen)</li>


    

<li><strong>Duplicate:</strong> tap (source and destination) &#8211; touch object, then touch elsewhere on surface</li>


    

<li><strong>Move:</strong> drag (and drop) or multi-finger drag &#8211; move one or two to five fingertips over surface without losing contact</li>


    

<li><strong>Pan:</strong> drag hand &#8211;  move fingers and palm of one hand over surface without losing contact</li>


    

<li><strong>Scroll:</strong> drag (one or two fingers): move fingertip over scrollbar without losing contact, move two fingers up/down across surface, or touch scrollbar for extended period of time</li>


    

<li><strong>Scroll fast:</strong> flick &#8211; quickly brush surface with fingertip in the direction you want to scroll</li>


</ul>


LukeW refers to the more complex gestures, that may be unique to specific platforms, as compound or specialized touch gestures.


<h2><strong>Hover</strong></h2>


In this new touch world, you can&#8217;t rely on the &#8220;hover&#8221; action anymore (&#8220;at least not yet,&#8221; he says), and it&#8217;s left up to the designers to find something appropriate in its place &#8211; which I agree with him, hover isn&#8217;t an intentional action; people find information in the hover bubbles accidentally. And yes, there does seem to be a fine line between hover and tooltips.
LukeW&#8217;s advice? Design for mobile first. If you design for a desktop web browser, you may not think of things like the orientation, location input that could impact the UI. From another angle, one could argue that  it&#8217;s probably easier to build it a more complex system (mobile) and remove the unnecessary features (desktop) than vice versa.
