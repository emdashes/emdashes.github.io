<p>Aside from the crazy (anglophone?) old woman who tried to hit all of us with her cane and blessed us with words of profanity (the same one who successfully scammed our friend pierre), I have good impressions of Montréal. I like how it&#8217;s a complete different culture/country (the language adds to that effect even though I know minimal French); they seem pretty laid back when it&#8217;s not in reference to driving skills. I think the historical aspect of the city adds to the culture and the Métro seems to be quite accessible. I appreciate that Montréal has many (safe) bicycle paths/trails, adding another means of transportation for travellers/commuters. Although the city is surrounded by churches and a cross that lights up on a hill, it&#8217;s sad to hear how some churches are converted to attractions/places for tourism, etc. but yet, it&#8217;s encouraging to hear the various ministries that active churches have to reach out to the people (like my friend&#8217;s church in Chinatown).</p>




<p>During my weekend, I met with old and new friends. I was sad to hear that a new friend was already leaving the country. I would classify him as a seeker &#8211; pray for him as he goes back to his home country. Pray that although it is a &#8220;closed&#8221; country, that his questions will continue to be asked (and answered) and that he will find peace and Hope and that he will readjust well back with his friends and family and his culture. I thank God that our lives crossed. One &#8220;old&#8221; friend was one whom I couldn&#8217;t place a name to her face. She looked strikingly familiar. Turns out, she went to my home church (BAC) way back when and here, our lives crossed again. If my memory holds true, I am also certain that she was one of the interviewers who interviewed me for a CC project back in 2001/2002; alas, I didn&#8217;t get the web job at HQ (but I did end up in Ottawa which was another good life experience). Ironically, I may also have met her at CC&#8217;s Christmas Conference as well. Actually now that I&#8217;m browsing through the iamnext.com website, I seem to know quite a number of people, some I don&#8217;t even remember From where: Corey, Gideon, Grace, Heather, Josh, Heather, Lisa, Peggy, Sean, and Shermeen&#8230;

I have noticed that I enjoy reading signs and advertisements in foreign languages, where my literacy level is low. My attempts to read reminded me of my attempts to read the subway signs an ads in Hong Kong and Korea; it&#8217;s challenging enough to the point where it is fun.
One great way to boost understandig of a foreign language is reading comic books; it&#8217;s quite natural for me to pick one up. First in Chinese, then in French (Dragonball first from my cousins)! Currently reading Boule &#038; Bill. I have Volume 9 but here&#8217;s a sample from 23:

The adventures between a boy and a dog is quite entertaining. I think I&#8217;ll buy more next time I&#8217;m in Montréal if they&#8217;re still on sale. The MSRP is $13.50 CDN; I got it for 4.95$ :).
