<h2>1:</h2>




<blockquote><a href="https://twitter.com/KensingtonRoyal/status/756407093373112320" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Can&#8217;t believe it&#8217;s been three years already!</a>[ref]this is in reference to Prince George but we echo their sentiments[/ref]</blockquote>


Though some days, it feels like more. The latest word trend after terrible twos, is not terrifying threes, but threenager. This past year was definitely a year of growth for Bean, both physically and developmentally, expressing herself more verbally, and understanding negotiation tactics, and lately, how to use a firm no. Instead of terrible or tantrum twos (thankfully), I would say teary twos, with more tears&nbsp; as of late and constant[ly the same] questions, accompanied with some whining, as she flip flips from learned independence to craved dependence. She enjoys watching mommy cook and helps out wherever she can: whether it&#8217;s loading the laundry machine, putting dishes away, prepping food for cooking &#8211; I often have to remind myself that although it&#8217;s often faster to do it myself, it&#8217;s these moments that are teaching and practice opportunities, and that I will likely regret it later when she does grow up and decide helping mommy do house chores isn&#8217;t exactly fun.&nbsp; She&#8217;s growing up though: almost toilet-trained (didn&#8217;t take the 3 day potty training route), figured out how to blow her nose, uses the correct personal pronouns more often, and eagerly takes on older sister roles, like feeding the baby, or watching and/or playing with him (ie. bossing him around) while mommy is momentarily occupied or keeping a watchful eye from a distance, which when he co-operates is quite wonderful as I can multi-task. She also enjoys finishing off her brother&#8217;s unfinished leftovers, which I remember I enjoyed too when my younger brother was eating baby food. Lately though, she has also reverted to not wanting to sleep on her own at night and wakes up multiple times in one night.
Things that have not changed much through the first three years:


<ol>
    

<li>She is&nbsp; happy to be the cautious observer-follower instead of the leader, though she can be determined/persistent (aka stubborn, like both her parents) &#8211; which sometimes translates to being fiesty, and/or bossy. For her, being a cautious observer seems to lends well to having an eye for detail and a good memory.</li>


    

<li>She hates the feeling of tears and runny nose on her face when it is caused by crying and she refuses to wipe it herself. The more you make her, the more water works result &#8211; a vicious cycle, really. Meltdowns often happen around some seemingly inconsequential thing, but it&#8217;s really a build-up of unsaid/unresolved feelings inside (maybe it&#8217;s feeling like she&#8217;s not being heard or lack of closeness / security that you&#8217;re there)</li>


    

<li>Early enthused independence of feeding herself does not translate to continued self-independence</li>


</ol>

<h2>2:</h2>


In other developmental news, our almost 8-month old can now roll over from front to back, and back to front, though I think he really just rolls in one direction each way. He also can sit up unassisted for extended periods, and we have been practicing moving by trying to place items he wants a little beyond his reach. While he mouths everything, I can already sense that he is a much pickier eater than Bean was, despite his love for bananas and apples and sometimes sweet potatoes; he appears to really dislike yogurt, and maybe because it&#8217;s really cold and when upon skin contact, it turned red (like it did with peanut oil, tomatoes, and oranges for Bean). While we haven&#8217;t given rice cereal after that one time when he threw it all up, he doesn&#8217;t seem to have any problems with regular rice or barley. We need to give him more opportunities to practice grabbing food and eating it, which he has been with chunks of bananas, raw chunks of apples and celery sticks (a perfect gnawing/teething food I find), cooked zucchini and pasta tubes (rigatoni), a messy experiment as it often ends up on the floor, though I might try cooked broccoli florets or carrots next; the harder foods like apples and celery I need to watch closely as sometimes he swallows before chewing it well.&nbsp; He&#8217;s still a relatively chill baby, which I am especially thankful for&nbsp;as I don&#8217;t think I would be able to handle two of the same temperaments; he is content to spend time in the playpen (or modern term: play yard) with his toys or chewing on a toy in his swing, preferring these two items more often than in the bouncer, and I can leave him for a short to an extended period, depending on his mood, before he complains, whereas his sister would still prefer that I am next to her all the time, if she had her way.&nbsp; I&#8217;m glad our playpen is getting some use, as Bean didn&#8217;t like it back then (same story with Sophie la giraffe), although she now enjoys going inside at times to sit and play with him! He&#8217;s also been able to effectively eliminate on the mini toilet seat a few times which saved me from having to clean up a messy (cloth) diaper, but we have also encountered baby in pain while trying to strain, poor boy.


<blockquote>For this boy I prayed, and the Lord has given me my petition which I asked of Him. So I have also dedicated him to the Lord; as long as he lives he is dedicated to the Lord.&#8221; &#8211; 1 Samuel 1:27-28a (NASB)
Train up a child in the way he should go: and when he is old, he will not depart from it.&#8221; &#8211; Proverbs 22:6 (KJV)</blockquote>


As parents, we feel that it is important to lead and spiritually nurture our children so that they will develop a desire to love God and be followers of Christ, so&nbsp; while we had a small baby dedication ceremony at Bean&#8217;s one-month celebration, we decided to wait until j.w&#8217;s family could join us and held off until this year&#8217;s baptism service at our church (which effectively became a baptism + baby dedication service); it was especially meaningful to see our friends and family who don&#8217;t normally go our church present as I felt like they&#8217;re the ones that will support us in raising our children[ref]it takes a village, as the saying goes [/ref].

<h2>3:</h2>


A friend recently commented that I look thinner yet again, and to my surprise when I stepped on the scale, she was right. Turns out it took me almost 8 months, 3 months longer to reach the low end of my last postpartum weight loss, and more &#8211; no wonder my pants all feel loose; I was beginning to attribute it to pregnancy stretching them out.&nbsp; I&#8217;d better consult the &#8220;<a href="http://her.happyhippos.ca/2013/12/how-to-gain-more-weight/">How to gain more weight</a>&#8221; post again. /86]]&gt;		</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				<![CDATA[A bittersweet proud mama moment.
Wow! After a little more than two and a half years, Bean is now naturally okay with me leaving the room before falling asleep - which leaves me with a little more free time in the evenings and some time in the afternoon when her brother is napping. &nbsp;She surprised me when&nbsp;she practically kicked me out during one of her naps when she heard her brother crying the other day, saying that I needed to feed him. Now, I tell her that I've forgotten to brush my teeth, she chimes in and tells me that I've forgotten to shower, and sends me away after I tuck her in and telling her she doesn't need to be scared, and leaving the door open a crack. After hearing my mother tell me that if I don't let her cry it out, then she will continue to need me until years later (like&nbsp;into school age), I wasn't quite prepared for this as she was still making sure to hug me closer when she heard her brother cry just a week or two ago, and then reluctantly let me go after I told her I would come back. We're on Day 3 - dare I&nbsp;hope that this will become a new routine that sticks?]]&gt;		</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				<![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_4950" align="alignright" width="299"]<img class="size-full wp-image-4950" src="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/sleep.png" alt="Fitbit sleep" width="299" height="262"/> I went to bed close to 1AM, but my fitbit correctly detected that I didn&#8217;t actually get a chance to sleep until&nbsp;past&nbsp;4AM[/caption]
While I usually welcome routine and structure,&nbsp;I feel&nbsp;like I am&nbsp;wasting my days&nbsp;away&nbsp;in too&nbsp;much routine lately, to the point where every day feels the same.&nbsp;Perhaps it&#8217;s cabin fever from postpartum confinement&nbsp;that seems like time is dragging,&nbsp;and yet, he&#8217;s almost three weeks old, and I only have 10ish days left before I can freely leave the house (without feeling guilty or lectured at) whether to get some fresh air or a change in environment.
Even with help, I&#8217;m feeling drained and spent; I don&#8217;t know how single&nbsp;parents or&nbsp;those whose spouses&nbsp;are away do it &#8211; kudos to them. One huge advantage of the postpartum confinement practice is the help: I can get away from not having to do dishes, cook meals, change as many diapers,&nbsp;and entertain the toddler so I can&nbsp;feed the baby on demand,&nbsp;&nbsp;get some shut-eye to make up for the little sleep I get at night. When help &#8211; in the form of either set of parents &#8211; leaves, I worry most about how to juggle the sleep schedules&nbsp;with two (bad parenting habits on our part&nbsp;as some would say, as the toddler requires too much help to fall asleep). I also hope I can figure out a way to connect with my daughter again because right now, I feel like mommy doesn&#8217;t have fun with her anymore; instead, mommy is just around to help her do things (like change diapers, feed her, bedtime routine, take her to the toilet, wash her hands) &#8211; which is probably why she&#8217;s even more resistant to other people helping her do these things these days, and would on occasion&nbsp;breakdown or have an outburst as a result.
Lately, a typical day looks like: <span style="color: #008000;">feed baby</span>, <span style="color: #008000;">change diaper</span>, <span style="color: #ff9900;">eat a meal</span>, <span style="color: #ff00ff;">feed toddler</span>, <span style="color: #008000;">feed baby</span>,&nbsp;<span style="color: #ff00ff;">put toddler&nbsp;down for a nap (short bedtime routine)</span>, <span style="color: #ff9900;">power nap or laundry</span>, <span style="color: #008000;">feed baby</span>, <span style="color: #ff00ff;">tend to toddler who has woken up within the hour</span>, <span style="color: #800080;">change diapers on both</span>, <span style="color: #ff9900;">eat another meal</span>, <span style="color: #ff00ff;">feed toddler</span>,<span style="color: #008000;"> feed baby</span>, <span style="color: #ff00ff;">persuade the toddler to fall sleep (long bedtime routine)</span>, <span style="color: #008000;">feed&nbsp;baby</span>, <span style="color: #ff9900;">some down time and snacks</span>, and repeat the following until the morning:&nbsp;<span style="color: #008000;">feed baby</span>,&nbsp;<span style="color: #ff9900;">nap</span>, <span style="color: #008000;">feed baby</span>,&nbsp;<span style="color: #008000;">change diaper</span>, <span style="color: #008000;">feed baby</span>,<span style="color: #ff00ff;"> settle&nbsp;toddler</span>. (<span style="color: #008000;">green</span>: baby, <span style="color: #ff9900;">orange</span>: me, <span style="color: #ff00ff;">pink</span>: toddler)
Nights are the hardest because when I&#8217;m not sleeping, I silently will&nbsp;my&nbsp;husband to share in&nbsp;misery&nbsp;instead of&nbsp;serenely sleeping away or wonder why my toddler&nbsp;can&#8217;t easily&nbsp;be consoled by&nbsp;daddy when she wakes up&nbsp;in the middle of the night (and decides to cry for an hour instead). &nbsp;I know these aren&#8217;t very nice (or godly) thoughts&nbsp;and I know it gets better eventually, but it doesn&#8217;t mean that they escape me.&nbsp;There has been a week of reprieve, where he actually followed a nice 2-3 hour feeding schedule, and slept nicely in between.&nbsp;<del>Sadly, it didn&#8217;t last and&nbsp;was too good to be true.</del>&nbsp; At the time I started writing this post,&nbsp;he decided to feed every 1-2 hours nightly for a few days likely due to a growth spurt, but last night, it was nice to be back on a 2-3 hour sleep cycle again (funny how 2-3 hours is what to look forward these days). Though, it&#8217;s nice to have caught up with my Netflix playlist as a result.
The past few weeks have gone by quickly in terms of baby&#8217;s growth: he lost 10% of his birth weight, but recovered 1 kg within a week. Perhaps it&#8217;s because the midwife wisely waited until he grew a bit before doing the heel poke&nbsp;for the newborn tests, but he didn&#8217;t even flinch or cry when she drew blood.&nbsp;While he easily tucked into my arms before, his feet now stick out when he&#8217;s feeding. He gurgles and snorts and makes all sorts of funny expressions and noises, and while he slept through all sorts of background noises the second week, it seems like he&#8217;s&nbsp;starting to want to be held more during the day. He&#8217;s also prone to burp and regularly spit up (even from his nose, poor guy), which I guess makes up for all the two times Bean did.
This is why babies are hard work! I&#8217;m reminded why I started to enjoy being with and interacting with Bean more&nbsp;after she was 6 months old &#8211; by then, I probably would have a better hang of things&nbsp;with two as well.]]&gt;		</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				<![CDATA[The leaves are starting to change colours and the squirrels in our yard are sporting bushier and whiter tails, a sign that summer is inevitably ending and that autumn is just around the corner. And with only less than three months to go, I am feeling largely uncomfortable - whether it's from trying to avoid scratching two mosquito bites on the belly, all the baby movement, or me trying to find the sweet spot on the left side to fall asleep (because the left is optimal to get the baby in the right position); insomnia isn't helped by the fact that I tend to accidentally fall asleep after lunch and dinner with Bean more often now so waking up at 2AM leaves me wide awake, one time until 730AM. Also had an interesting conversation with my dentist and hygienist the other day; when I mentioned having swollen gums, he pretty much estimated that over 50% of pregnant women get some form of gingivitis during their pregnancy and probably more don't even know it or talk about it.
Instead of a nesting urge, I'm finding that I want to make the most of my available time with Bean before I'm confined or stuck indoors for the winter months and before the arrival of another child. Then again, this year has been a year of finding time for myself in the evenings as well, whether it has been badminton, ASL classes, or drawing classes, perhaps knowing that I will not have time for that again for a while. I am a little worried that our family will have difficulty adjusting to this addition, especially since our little one, but we're praying that the transition for everyone isn't going to be too rough and to have wisdom on how to handle it best then.


<hr />
In our news, we often catch Bean singing or counting to herself nowadays, with skipped lyrics, numbers, or letters, which makes it all the more amusing to listen to &#8211; especially when she sees multiples of one item, she just arbitrarily starts to count and assigns a number to it (e.g. 3 birds would be 1, 2, 3, 4 or 1, 2,3, 4, 5, 6 ducks).
PS. Third trimester means that I can start eating more watermelon (don&#8217;t ask, because I don&#8217;t know why only 3rd trimester is okay but others aren&#8217;t per Chinese mom &#8211; likely related to it being a &#8220;cool&#8221; fruit)! Oh yeah, and it&#8217;s time to start on the raspberry leaf tea.]]&gt;		</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				<![CDATA[I had a chance to spend a night away a few weekends ago sans child (<em>and</em> husband) for the first time and while I had moments where another friend&#8217;s almost 2-year old daughter reminded me of Bean, the experience felt strangely quite liberating, especially at the wedding reception in the evening as I didn&#8217;t have to keep watching the clock, my phone for child-related messages (in fact, I had forgotten it at home!), or for a good opportunity to leave early because it was her bedtime; it was also nice to be able to spend the afternoon with a few friends associated with my time in Ottawa without worrying that j.w would be bored, some of which I hadn&#8217;t seen or talked to in many years, many of whom are now married and have children of their own, and all but one have settled elsewhere.
When my friend, the father of the almost 2-yo asked me what Bean was like, I had a moment&#8217;s pause: what do I say? I&#8217;m not sure whether her antics are typical of toddlers, or unique to Bean&#8217;s personality, like her preference to mommy first or her nature to do things a specific way or expectations of them to be done in a certain order and will often get frustrated when she wants to do it herself but doesn&#8217;t know how yet. I would probably have a better answer to that question if I poll people who interact with her (@readers: feel free to comment on this!). Now after some reflection, I could say that she seems to observe first, followed by narrating everything she sees or asking what other people are doing, but while she prefers the company of others, especially during play, when she&#8217;s around a group of people or new faces, she doesn&#8217;t tend to say as much; she is more of a follower than a leader &#8211; initially cautious or unsure, watching what others do before she tries it and oft seeks approval by looking my way to gauge my reaction &#8211; but that is also perhaps why she enjoys the company of older boys too (they seem to have an air of confidence) and tends to pick up certain things very quickly; and when testing boundaries, she sometimes also has this calculating look before she decides whether to do what you just told her not to do.&nbsp; (Lately though, we&#8217;ve noticed her starting to stutter at the beginning of some sentences even though her ideas are quite formed, but my mother says my brother did that and grew out of it too so it&#8217;s not necessarily a cause to worry yet)]]&gt;		</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				<![CDATA[We've been back for about an equal amount of time that we've been away so this post is overdue!


<h3>Returning (to my childhood) home</h3>


I hadn&#8217;t been back for an extended period for a decade so I was looking forward to spending time with friends we don&#8217;t see when we go back and seeing family more often than when we usually do when we go back (which is significant when you realize people, like your parents especially, are a decade older!). Yet, it wasn&#8217;t long before we got into a regular routine (including baby getting sick every 2 weeks and her sleeping-in) and my ambitions to bring babe to more activities resulted in only one visit to the library story time and song program, two visits to <a href="http://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/topic.page?id=F652EE0BCB224DC4A51BE9765B50817D&amp;title=StrongStart%20BC" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">StrongStart</a>, a visit or two to each indoor play space (Guildford Recreation Centre (1), Brentwood (1), Coquitlam Centre (2), and Lougheed Mall (1)), and one-time visits with friends and extended family we don&#8217;t normally see on our short visits. Towards the end of the trip, I realized that in my procrastination (laziness or perception that everything is so far), I didn&#8217;t end up seeing everyone we wanted &#8211; at first, the thinking was, &#8220;Oh, we have all this time&#8230;&#8221; but then by the last week or so, it became a scramble to fit everyone we wanted to see into our schedule and we had to miss some people.&nbsp; But, this real-life lesson hit home for me when it comes to our spiritual state: we often tend to put God off in our lives, thinking that there&#8217;s so much time in our lives to think about that until it&#8217;s too late.
What really struck me as being strange, is that I didn&#8217;t have a strong desire to go snowshoeing this time &#8211; which seems to reflect how I felt about snow activities growing up; it was not until I moved away and returned home that I wanted to snowboard and snowshoe (and ice skate). I&#8217;m not sure if it was because we acclimatized to the warmer weather that I didn&#8217;t really want to venture into the cold, whereas coming from cold makes the mountain weather more tolerable.
Little Bean hit many milestones while there including walking and saying &#8220;Daddy!&#8221; for the first time, and while it took some time for her to be herself again (after being intimidated by new faces and places), I was happy to see that she found friends more her age to play with, especially at church, and that her separation anxiety seemed to taper off, which meant she was okay in the church nursery &#8211; even to the point where mommy and her friend was able to get a smoothie sans toddler in tow!


<h3>Returning (to this family&#8217;s) home</h3>


Just as it took her almost a month to adapt to her surroundings while she was away, she also seemed to feel less at ease to freely roam and explore back at home when we returned, and although the first few times back at church meant she was more clingy, she&#8217;s now back to herself and seems more open to meeting new faces and spending time with people without her parents always by her side. While I do miss the daily option to go to a free program at a local school for her, a childcare program at church, the number of free indoor play spaces, and her same-age friend and her cousin, it&#8217;s good to be back&nbsp; &#8211; and we can work on finding things to do here and getting to know other children here.
Upon our return, I learned a few things:


<ul>
    

<li>Buzz Lightyear somehow managed to get two hours ahead! (my side table alarm clock which seems to never be on time so I stopped resetting it every so often)</li>


    

<li>If you don&#8217;t want your toys and other things to be covered in dust, especially when you&#8217;re renovating, put them away or make sure they&#8217;re covered</li>


    

<li>And in terms of milestones, I stopped counting. Except that at 17 months, she willfully disobeyed, which when it happened, I thought hashtag <em>#originalsin</em> and it became another spiritual lesson: we teach our children to do many things, but we don&#8217;t need to teach them to give you a look that says they&#8217;re going to test the boundaries and then go about doing what you instructed them not to do, just as God often tells us things for our own good but we don&#8217;t listen and do the complete opposite.</li>


</ul>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				<![CDATA[BTSC, BASC, BPSC, BESC, BRD, BBID, BES, BIS, BDS...this is just a shortlist of the myriad of acronyms that I encountered at my last job — of course not all of them started with the letter B. I must not have been the only one to get lost in the sea of acronyms because someone put together an acronym dictionary online at one point for people to consult (how many people knew about it is another question).
Guess what? When you enter the realm of mommy-hood, you don't escape the realm of acronyms either, especially if you spend anytime online. I remember wondering what certain acronyms meant, and while I could venture a guess at some, others I had to look up as well (trusty Google ← an ironic statement right there). And while some are directly related to your status as a mother, like SAHM, WAHM, DH, DD, DS, LO, EBF, you also encounter ones that are related to buying and selling items such as baby clothing and gear like EUC, NWT, PP, PM. Oh, I just learned about HIPPO and GOAT as I was typing this post, at first puzzled to why animals would represent read or not read the previous posts but then I read what they stood for.
But like my previous job, once I figured them out, I started to use acronym-speak but I still tend to spell it out depending on who I think my audience is. Now, if you don't know the "mommy-acronyms", take a guess at some and then check the answers below.


<ul style="font-size: small;">
    

<li>SAHM: stay-at-home mom, WAHM: work-at-home mom</li>


    

<li>DH: dear husband, DD: dear daughter, DS: dear son, LO: little one</li>


    

<li>EBF: exclusively breast-fe(e)d</li>


    

<li>EUC: excellent used condition, NWT: new with tags, PP: pending pick-up, PM: private message</li>


    

<li>HIPPO: happily ignoring previous posters, GOAT: going over asinine threads</li>


</ul>


How many did you get right?]]&gt;		</p>

				<![CDATA[]]>		]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				<![CDATA[This post has been in draft for almost a whole year, as I didn't really know how to finish it, but I will make an attempt here:
I admit it; I have an identity crisis in two areas of life: I generally have a really hard time telling people that I am a Christian and a stay-at-home mom, both by choice. For the latter, I can conveniently say that I'm home now because I don't have a job to return to, and that I would consider going back to work if an awesome opportunity presents itself that I cannot pass up (which is true, and ideally, it could be as great as flexible, work-from-home hours). In reality though,&nbsp; if I didn't get laid off, I would have had to face the decision of quitting my job to stay at home and it would have been a lot harder for me to let go (of my career to stay home) if given the choice, even though the plan was exactly that. I'm blessed that I didn't have to make that choice, and that God provided me a nice nest egg as a result! (awesome because how many people get to say that?)
<em>The context that started this post? </em>
At the start of the year, some members of our <del>small</del> somewhat large <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_group" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cell group</a> headed to a small farm / warm home for part of the weekend to have our first retreat*.
When one of the retreat organizers suggested that our theme passage <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=daniel+12&amp;version=NIV" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Daniel 12</a>, I first thought it an odd choice, as it seemed to speak of the end times.
But by the end of the weekend, what stuck was that Daniel chose to live differently in a secular world and boldly at that (by not keeping who he served secret through lifestyle choices <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=daniel+1%3A8-20&amp;version=ESV" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">like diet</a> and <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Daniel%206&amp;version=ESV" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">prayer life</a>). He didn&#8217;t know that God would honour his decision not only then (including by saving his life from being devoured by lions) but also by using him as an example for generations to come.


<blockquote>&#8220;And those who are wise shall shine like the brightness of the sky above; and those who turn many to righteousness, like the stars forever and ever.&#8221; <span class="il">Daniel</span> <span class="il">12</span>:3 (ESV)</blockquote>


Am I Daniel? Far from it. Regrettably, I kept my faith a lot more quiet at this company than my previous one, feeling wary about telling others about<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Peter+3:15&amp;version=NIVhttp://" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> the hope that I have, much less the reason for it</a>. And in regards to staying at home, perhaps it is because the majority of the current-generation moms around me return to work these days, including my family, friends, and coworkers (not one mom at work has gone on maternity and quit), so I still feel a bit guilty admitting that I&#8217;m a stay-at-home-mom. But, like I&#8217;ve done before but somehow managed to forget until now, the more I share about my identity, the easier it say it out loud.&nbsp;
I guess I have always beat to my own drum; I was the only one in my year to graduate with an English degree and a CS minor, I was the sole UX designer on my team, and now, a stay-at-home-mom among working moms. I&#8217;m thankful for the new (levels of) friendships because motherhood is now what we share in common and some of those friends are stay-at-home moms &#8211; perhaps one day I can ask them about their transition and their story.


<hr />
&nbsp;
*The definitions of <em>retreat&nbsp;</em>from <a href="http://ninjawords.com/retreat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ninjawords.com</a> seems to have a more negative connotation associated with that word.&nbsp; When it comes to going on a retreat in the Christian-jargon context, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retreat_%28spiritual%29#Christianity" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wikipedia&#8217;s</a> explanation seems more fitting:


<blockquote>The Christian retreat can be defined in the most simplest of terms as a definite time (from a few hours in length to a month) spent away from one&#8217;s normal life for the purpose of reconnecting, usually in prayer, with God. Although the practice of leaving one&#8217;s everyday life to connect on a deeper level with God, be that in the desert (as with the <a title="Desert Fathers" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desert_Fathers">Desert Fathers</a>), or in a monastery, is as old as Christianity itself, the practice of spending a specific time away with God is a more modern phenomenon, dating from the 1520s and <a title="St. Ignatius of Loyola" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Ignatius_of_Loyola">St. Ignatius of Loyola</a>&#8216;s composition of the Spiritual Exercises. Jesus fasting in the desert for forty days is used as a biblical justification of retreats.</blockquote>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				<![CDATA[Month seven was a rough month in terms of sleep (or sleeplessness), with tearful nights likely from teething and napless afternoons. Baby Tylenol was used far too many times for mommy's liking, but it was a last resort that worked (Camilia, a homeopathic alternative didn't seem to do much for her).
The beginning of the 8th month marks new milestones! While sleep is still somewhat challenging at times, Little Bean has gone from 2-3 hour night-time cycles back to 5-6 hour stretches, which gives Mommy some sleep relief. Naps are still few and far between, but 1 nap a day is still better than no naps. No, that's not a milestone, haha. A milestone would be her success of pooping in the toilet on a potty seat a few times now = less clean-up, yay! Mommy still has to catch her facial cues and race against her system (either in time or not distract her enough that she doesn't go anymore).
We have also introduced her to meat: chicken. She doesn't seem to like it as much as her veggies and fruits (I don't blame her), but she's willing to try it. Actually, she's been pretty good about eating her food; she's only rejected food given to her once: store-bought baby food. I tried it and think it might be because the lemon juice concentrate in it makes it too sour. So far, she's tried the following (all made at home, minus the cereals because of the iron fortification):


<ul>
    

<li>rice and barley cereals</li>


    

<li>avocado</li>


    

<li>bananas</li>


    

<li>carrots</li>


    

<li>sweet potato</li>


    

<li>beets</li>


    

<li>apple</li>


    

<li>red swiss chard</li>


    

<li>spinach</li>


    

<li>kale</li>


    

<li>rice puffs</li>


    

<li>corn puff crackers</li>


    

<li>a couple bites of a slice of orange</li>


</ul>


What surprised us was that she seemed to really like kale and swiss chard! She couldn&#8217;t get enough (or we just don&#8217;t feed her fast enough): she just kept opening her mouth to signal, &#8220;I want more!&#8221;
Sometimes I think we&#8217;re doing a hybrid model of baby-led weaning and pureed/mashed foods. I try to give her soft foods in hopes that she will self-feed, but instead, she happily mushes the bananas and the avocado in her finger, and takes the corn puff cracker and smash it into pieces; she will, however, eat them from my hands or from a spoon, or from her hand once we place a piece of the cracker into her mouth and guide her hand to hold the rest. The purees we feed her is more lumpy than smooth, and I actually find that she seems more willing to eat chicken when fed to her in chunks or shreds. If using only one hand at the table is an early sign of what could be her dominant hand, we think that she may be right-handed (her left leg also gets stuck too when she tries to move from sitting to tummy).
What to try next?
Broccoli perhaps, and&nbsp; white fish is certainly on the let&#8217;s-venture-outside-of-the-fruit-veggies horizon.]]&gt;		</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				<![CDATA[Recently, we have had more friends around us getting engaged, married, and having babies, so to help the parents-to-be or my future self, I've compiled a list of memorable "freebies" that I remember signing up for or have heard about - I don't remember which freebie sign-up gave me samples of bamboo wipes and nursing pads though.
Before we start, here's a tip: because you're signing up for a lot of these programs online (and in store), you may be asked for an email address. I find that having a dedicated "baby" or "junk mail" email address really helps filter the baby-related items. If you don't want samples to come to your direct address, you can also send it to your <a href="https://www.canadapost.ca/flexdelivery">FlexDelivery</a> (PO Box) address at a local Canada Post office.


<ol>
    

<li>Gift Registries
If you are considering signing up for a baby gift registry, there are a couple of options:


<ul>
    

<li>Babies &#8220;R&#8221; Us: upon placing a few items on the registry <em>in store</em>, a bag of freebies/samples and coupons will be given to you. If I remember correctly, a 0-6 mo pacifier was in mine, and a BPA free bottle (which we didn&#8217;t really like &#8211; we preferred the Avent bottles in the end). <del>If you deliver on your submitted expected date (or your guess), they will give you a gift as well</del>.</li>


    

<li> Sears: apparently, if purchases are made from your registry with them, and <a href="http://her.happyhippos.ca/2013/07/baby-predictions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">if you guess the correct date of the baby&#8217;s arrival</a>, then <a href="http://www.giftregistry.sears.ca/gift/egrWgEn.jsp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">you get credit back for those purchases</a>. I didn&#8217;t know about this, or else I may have benefitted <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></li>


</ul>


</li>


    

<li>Work Benefits


<ul>
    

<li>Employee Assistant Programs: Through my employer&#8217;s employee assistance program, we got 3 books (A What to Expect book, a year one book for Daddy, and a board book), a Baby Einstein lullaby CD, <a href="http://www.snugglebugz.ca/baby-whoozit.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a mini Whoozit toy</a>, and some other generic literature</li>


    

<li>Health insurance and fitness credits: this covered a private ward for recovery after delivery, and also allowed me to buy a jogging stroller as well as a breast pump</li>


</ul>


</li>


    

<li>Brands
Even though you may plan to breastfeed exclusively, you might need formula as emergency supply or even to give away to other expectant/new moms since formula actually costs a fair bit!


<ul>
    

<li><a href="https://www.startwell.nestle.ca/en/user/register" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nestle Baby</a>: you need to select that you plan to formula feed to get the backpack with change pad I&#8217;ve been told, some formula, and maybe a bottle?</li>


    

<li>Enfamil: formula</li>


    

<li>Johnson &amp; Johnson used to give out a free travel pack of baby products if you request it from their contact form, but when I did, they sent me a voucher to claim one in store <del>(which I haven&#8217;t found a place that carries them yet), and when my sister inquired, she was just directed to healthyessentials.ca to request non-baby related samples</del>. You can now sign up for an account at <a href="http://www.healthyessentials.ca" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">healthyessentials.ca</a>, fill out your profile to say when you&#8217;re expecting and they will automatically give you a form to fill out so that they can send you the the voucher.</li>


</ul>


</li>


    

<li>Stores


<ul>
    

<li><del>Shoppers Drug Mart: VIB &#8211; free pack of diapers (I actually received two, but it could be because the fine print said offer valid until Dec 31, 2012 so I emailed them about it; my sister only got a coupon for diapers, I think), a baby bib, and coupons for 1000 Optimum points for buying various products, like baby Tylenol, diapers, drinks and snacks. Be sure to opt in on Optimum emails as they seem to send diaper coupons every so often (my sister has gotten $8 off any size pack of diapers and some other freebie).</del> <strong>Update:</strong> they discontinued the program sometime near the end of 2016.</li>


    

<li><a href="http://www.sobeyspharmacy.com/bbh" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sobeys Baby Be Healthy</a>: free monthly vitamins up to a year (you just need to go once a month), reuseable bag, a couple of Size 2 Compliments brand diapers<del> &#8211; these perks may only be given to you if you sign up in store (at the pharmacy)
</del>Update: I was able to sign up online and get a small gift bag in store, and this time it contained a package of Huggies Little Snugglers newborn diapers!</li>


    

<li>Thyme Maternity: they may be affiliated with the Nestle program, but when I went on <a title="It’s about Thyme" href="http://her.happyhippos.ca/2013/05/its-about-thyme/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Customer Appreciation Day</a>, I think I got more than the standard package. Signing up to receive their emails will also alert you when they have a 1-item 50% off coupons.</li>


    

<li>Speaking of stores, if you&#8217;re already shopping for baby items online, some stores have referral codes so that you can get a new member discount (search on <a href="http://retailmenot.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">retailmenot.com</a> for online stores), or 5% off items that you have put in your cart but abandoned mid-transaction for whatever reason (e.g. Snugglebugz.ca). Oh, and be on the lookout for diaper coupons in newspaper flyer inserts like Redplum or P&amp;G, or online through sites like websaver.ca or P&amp;G (can&#8217;t remember if it was brandsampler.ca or brandsaver.ca) and remember to price it per diaper to see whether is sale is actually a good deal since each store has their own count of diapers per box (<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AoVtPmnZqKqFdEEzWk1zU01WX0Q2OWpMenVEeTZQd2c&amp;usp=drive_web#gid=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a handy spreadsheet helped me keep a tally</a>)</li>


    

<li>For those out west, <a href="http://www.londondrugs.com/Baby-Welcome-Package/baby-pkg%2Cdefault%2Cpg.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">London Drugs</a> has a sign-up form that you can complete to get a package in-store (or shipped free with $200+ purchase).</li>


</ul>


</li>


    

<li>Region&#8217;s resources


<ul>
    

<li>Our city&#8217;s library has a partnership with Zinio and <a href="https://www.rbdigital.com/kitcheneron/service/zinio/landing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">allows you to download magazines to keep</a>. They used to offer Today&#8217;s Parent, but now they have <a href="http://www.ecoparent.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">EcoParent</a> and Birthing magazines. One branch has a toy lending library that even allows you to borrow toys for free! (You can also get Today&#8217;s Parent for $1 an issue that&#8217;s mailed to your home if you&#8217;re an existing Rogers or Fido customer)</li>


    

<li>The Region of Waterloo has a <a href="http://chd.region.waterloo.on.ca/en/childFamilyHealth/Online-Prenatal-Program.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">free online prenatal program</a>. While I found in-class sessions helpful for answering questions and hands-on practice (e.g. massage techniques), this seems like a great refresher or prep resource.</li>


</ul>


</li>


    

<li>Midwife offices
And speaking of libraries, some midwife offices will have a lending library of books, DVDs, and even free samples from various companies (lansinoh/nipple and/or diaper rash cream, Today&#8217;s Parent magazines) or even an mommy-exchange box that may have gently used clothing for baby and mom-to-be!</li>


    

<li><strong>*Unverified*</strong> Baby Boxes: (<a href="https://babyboxcanada.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1</a>) and (<a href="http://www.babyboxco.com/blogs/news/all-about-ontario" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2</a>). Because my babies were born before these initiatives were offered, I don&#8217;t actually know if you will actually get a baby box; one of our friends did mention you have to complete a form and bring in a voucher to a physical place to get the box.</li>

Once the baby is born, you may wish to join free programs like (note: these examples may be specific to my area):


<ol>
    

<li><a href="http://www.children.gov.on.ca/htdocs/English/topics/earlychildhood/oeyc/index.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Early Years Centres</a></li>


    

<li>Mom and baby programs or support groups, either through local <a href="http://on.evanced.info/kpl/lib/eventcalendar.asp?Lib=All" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">libraries</a>, churches (e.g. <a href="http://www.mops.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MOPS</a> or our local Salvation Army&#8217;s <a href="http://www.sapcrc.com/programs.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Parent-Child Resource Centre</a>) or find meetings or activities online, such as Life With A Baby (LWAB) or <a href="http://www.lllc.ca/lllc-kitchenerwaterloo-wednesday-pm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">La Leche League</a> (LLLC for breastfeeding support)</li>


</ol>


Other moms, did I forget anything? I&#8217;ll try to keep this list updated if anything new pops up.
Oh, and happy pregnancy! It&#8217;s <del>exciting times</del> quite the adventure ahead :)]]&gt;		</p>
