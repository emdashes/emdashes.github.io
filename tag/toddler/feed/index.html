<p class="has-drop-cap">When you ask Little Brother how old he is, he holds up two fingers, and confidently says, &#8220;Three!&#8221; While I find myself correcting him almost every time, mathematically, I suppose he isn&#8217;t incorrect.</p>


<p>At the age he is at now, he&#8217;s starting to identify colours (or colors, for my American friends). He knows &#8220;black&#8221; and &#8220;wipe&#8221; (white), and maybe he knows the others too, but when you ask him what shirt he&#8217;s wearing, or what colour Daddy is wearing today, he might respond with &#8220;Thomas!&#8221;, &#8220;Percy!&#8221;, or &#8220;James!&#8221;. Some days, he might mention Emily or Stephen / Rocket too. It just so happens, those are the colours ofÂ  Thomas the train and friends; so, I suppose he isn&#8217;t incorrect.</p>


<p class="has-background has-very-light-gray-background-color">I&#8217;ve come to realize that although Bean doesn&#8217;t often show affection towards people, she deeply cares and loves her little brother. This side of her shows when we are trying to threaten him or put him in time out, she pleas that we don&#8217;t carry through (&#8220;I don&#8217;t want him to go to the hospital&#8221; or &#8220;don&#8217;t leave him!&#8221;) or wants to follow him into time out and be with him. So, in case you missed it &#8211; because I almost did: her favourite colour is no longer green, but currently, &#8220;Thomas&#8221;; I think his is James &#8211; because she has designated the red train in our set for him. He likes trains, so now, she does too.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				<![CDATA[When I <a href="http://her.happyhippos.ca/2017/07/first-solo-trip-with-two/">went to Vancouver last year with two little ones</a>, I wanted to minimize the amount of gear I needed to carry. Thankfully my sister&#8217;s kids are the same size, so I was able to limit my luggage to just a carry-on suitcase, a backpack (with snacks and activities), one car seat, and a diaper bag. I didn&#8217;t have to take a car seat with me, but I decided that having one on board would be safer and better overall, so I had to find a way to lug it without needing to carry it.


<h2>The suitcase stroller</h2>


I looked online for ideas, and saw a couple of products to help mitigate this problem &#8211; one was a foldable trolley where you put the car seat (and child in) and the other was a strap that looked like a T where it attached the car seat to a carry-on suitcase. Well, I didn&#8217;t want to buy anything that was only useful in this situation or bring along anything extra (like the trolley), so I tried to use what I had to mimic the T-strap. A mom in a local mom&#8217;s Facebook group asked me to post some screens of my setup when she saw a photo of what I did, and j.w wanted to record a video of it, so he did a wonderful job of capturing my explanation, Bean and all:

For those who don&#8217;t want to watch the unedited video, read on for some written instructions.


<h3>Materials</h3>


[caption id="attachment_6504" align="alignright" width="225"]<img class="wp-image-6504 size-medium" src="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/DSC_0154-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300" srcset="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/DSC_0154-225x300.jpg 225w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/DSC_0154-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/DSC_0154-1568x2091.jpg 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" /> What you need before connecting everything together[/caption]
This is what I used &#8211; and what you might need:


<ul>
    

<li><b>An adjustable luggage strap</b>. You might be able to get away without this if the LATCH straps on your car seat are long enough to wrap around to the back of the suitcase; mine cannot. It seems that Asian families back in the day were known to wrap their suitcases with luggage straps (to keep it together and to see it easier on the carousel, maybe?), so it was quite easy for me to find one lying around. I like this particular one because there is a loop in it that the carabiner clips in so it&#8217;s snug and it doesn&#8217;t move. I&#8217;ve also used a bungee cord in a pinch, when I left my luggage strap behind &#8211; but I didn&#8217;t feel it was safe to put a child in it then.</li>


    

<li><b>One carabiner</b>. If it&#8217;s weight supported (such as ones meant for climbing), it&#8217;s probably safer; mine&#8217;s not.</li>


    

<li><b>A key ring</b>, O-ring, or D-ring. You might be able to get away without this if the top tether can clip to the carabiner, but I find it much easier with it. Probably safer if it&#8217;s weight-tested as well. If you get rid of your luggage strap, you would need this so that the LATCH clips can clip/hook onto the ring.</li>


</ul>




<h3>The setup</h3>


[caption id="attachment_6503" align="alignright" width="225"]<img class="wp-image-6503 size-medium" src="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/DSC_0159-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300" srcset="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/DSC_0159-225x300.jpg 225w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/DSC_0159-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/DSC_0159-1568x2091.jpg 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" /> A closer look at what it looks like after everything is connected together[/caption]
A three-step summary:


<ol>
    

<li>Match the back of the car seat against the front of the carry-on suitcase when vertically standing</li>


    

<li>Thread the luggage strap through the car seat where the seat belt would go for a forward-facing set up, and adjust so that car seat is snug against the suitcase. If there are handles on your suitcase, put the luggage strap through them (the video shows the straps are twisted &#8211; try to make sure they&#8217;re flat before continuing).</li>


    

<li>Take the top tether of the car seat and thread it through the handles on top of the suitcase and the handle bar (I pull up the handlebar to make it easier), and hook and clip the tether to the ring, or the carabiner, if you don&#8217;t use a ring. Tighten, tilt, and test it out.</li>


</ol>


With the car seat strapped to the carry-on suitcase, I could either put all my stuff into the seat while Bean helped roll it, or she sat in it and helped hold some stuff, while I wore my 18 month old in a carrier. People looked our way, but I&#8217;m not sure if it&#8217;s because people haven&#8217;t seen others do this, and/or they were thinking what kind of crazy parent would do that. On Air Canada (Dreamliner specifically), I can roll this contraption down the aisle and get to my seat without undoing anything, but it does not fit down the aisle on WestJet or Air Canada Rouge planes &#8211; some will fit down business class but once you get to economy, you will quickly find out it doesn&#8217;t fit so it&#8217;s better just to undo it in the area where parents gate check their strollers and car seats. You will also need to buffer a little more time to take it apart and put it together again as you go through security screening.
Happy travelling!]]&gt;		</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				<![CDATA[That's our office cat in the photo. I'm one month in. And yet, it feels like a lot longer than that. I've found a rhythm that works with this new routine, and I'm thankful that both our kids have adjusted well too. Consequently, we transitioned our oldest to full day kindergarten, and after some trial and error, we dropped her afternoon nap, we eat dinner earlier, and they go to sleep earlier. Unfortunately, our youngest still wakes up at night and asks for food then, but our oldest seems to fall asleep faster and stays asleep throughout the night for the most part. This week has been one of the few germ-free weeks this year, so it's a nice relief to not have to deal with that (if it wasn't him, it was her, and if it wasn't either of them, it was us or our daycare) - I'm grateful that our workplaces are pretty flexible when it comes from work from home policies and taking time off / emergency days, so we pretty took turns staying home with one child or both children. How do working families who don't have backup plans / caregivers manage?
At the beginning, it sort of felt like I was starting at a new school in the middle of the school year; I had a lot to learn and a lot of faces and names to remember. I still have a lot to learn and faces and names to remember, but it feels like I'm making an impact. I'm also thankful that I enjoy my work, so it's easy to wake up earlier and rush out the door.
We will have to find a different routine come summer, but so far, it's been working out just perfectly. I'm glad I scaled back my hours (before signing the offer) because it turns out if you're driving a car for school pick-up, you pretty much have to arrive in the neighbourhood at least 20 minutes early in order to find available street parking around the perimeter of the school; otherwise, you're pretty much out of luck. And even though I get off at 2:30PM, by the time I get everyone home, it's 4PM. I then give them a small snack, work on unloading the dishwasher and getting another load in, and starting supper. By the time we are done dinner, it's close to 7PM, and we play a bit then bathe (if applicable), and then off to bed. After that, I clean up the kitchen (pack food away, prep lunches) and maybe wash or fold the laundry. I've been doing laundry on weekends in loads, so I can just sit and binge-watch Netflix (working through The Crown) while folding.
Surprisingly, I find myself dozing off before midnight and using the computer less after work (but still on my phone) - maybe it's because I no longer have mid-day naps or work is more tiring than staying at home (though I feel it's a break / nice change from home life). I'm on a modified work week, and I'm already wondering how full-time working parents do this every day and survive? I applaud those families!
Other than work and school, we started going to a different small group / life group, which has changed to an earlier start time, which means for the first time in a long time, we actually get to stay past dinner. We have also started going to another church, primarily because Bean is at an age where she is learning, and I simply can't go on teaching her every week - and when I don't, I hear implied comments about going to a different church anyway. I'm a little sad, but since I also miss fellowship time because I'm watching them after service is over while everyone else is chatting and because people don't tend to eat together for lunch as much anymore, I'm not really connecting with anyone either. I know Bean misses it because on occasion, she tells me she wants to go back to Simply, or that she wants me to be her teacher that day, and every time we pass by St. Paul's, she points out that it's our church. Finding a new church to call home is hard. Personally, I don't like the format of the sermons by the lead pastor at this new church so far (grossly paraphrased: partial verses are taken from different translations to fit into the sermon's points) though the supporting pastor actually goes into a passage in contrast, but the kids seem to have adjusted so well even at the first visit and a lot of effort is put into the children's spiritual wellbeing and education. So yes, 2018 is going to be a year of change and adjustment.


<hr />
Two years ago, we were celebrating <a href="http://her.happyhippos.ca/2016/02/two-month-milestones/">two month milestones</a>. Now, at 2, he&#8217;s come a long way:


<ul>
    

<li>Speaks in complete sentences. Has started to communicate (and copy) in English. Boo.</li>


    

<li>Enjoys climbing and doing crazy things and will deliberately test boundaries with people in authority (me &#8211; he&#8217;s heavy so I can&#8217;t just pick him up and grab him while grocery shopping for example, so I don&#8217;t go when I&#8217;m on my own as it&#8217;s impossible to get more than one or two things in one trip)</li>


    

<li>Loves to sing, and can sing many songs in English including the Alphabet song, Twinkle Twinkle Little Star, Away in the Manger, Roly Poly and can sing along with or recognize songs by Walk Off the Earth, Moana, and Frozen.</li>


    

<li>Loves trains, especially Thomas. And cars. And airplanes. Prefers trains though, if given a choice.</li>


    

<li>Easily sucked in by technology: photos on the phone, TV, iPad game, and YouTube videos. One time early on, the caregiver gave an older child a tablet to use while the younger ones were supposed to nap; he had a meltdown and refused to sleep. Then she figured out why (we had warned her prior so she made the connection and no more problems since).</li>


    

<li>Has not completely weaned. So, I&#8217;m still off dairy and some nuts. Nuts!</li>


    

<li>While he started off with liking meat, he doesn&#8217;t seem to like meat (fish the exception) as much anymore, unless it&#8217;s chicken nuggets/fingers/crispy. He will still eat it but when it is in chunks, he tends to pick it out. He also doesn&#8217;t like green fiber veggies, but will repeatedly down it in smoothie form. Like his sister, he loves fruit. Avocados, bananas, and cereal with alternative milk are now his favourite breakfast foods. He is a soup and rice monster. Sometimes noodles too.</li>


    

<li>Self-toilet training is hit and miss so far &#8211; and if successful, it&#8217;s still only #2 (though a few times, he wakes up with a dry diaper and will go if you put him on the toilet); progress seems to have slowed down or regressed especially now that he doesn&#8217;t tell his caregiver he needs to go (or maybe she hasn&#8217;t learned the signs yet)</li>


    

<li>He may have had a mini <a href="http://her.happyhippos.ca/2017/04/the-day-we-had-our-first-ambulance-ride/">febrile seizure</a> the other week, when he had a slight fever (while fighting off strange rashes &#8211; maybe mild symptoms of hand, foot, mouth + reaction to lactose in Tylenol) but it lasted no more than a few seconds and it was in his sleep.</li>


    

<li>He seems interested in people he knows (and babies) &#8211; often willing to share a toy, asking for someone by name, offering hugs to those he loves (except it&#8217;s sad to see hugs not reciprocated, especially when his sister comes out from dance class and he goes to hug her and she brushes him off; however, she always asks to go into timeout with him when he&#8217;s in trouble), and enjoys helping out in the kitchen (putting dishes away, watching and helping mommy cook/bake)</li>


    

<li>He must have shorter legs or something, because he fits his age in tops when it comes to sizing but his bottoms are behind a bit.</li>


</ul>


I&#8217;m amazed at how fast our children is growing up, now that we all have slightly different routines and that they are no longer babies.]]&gt;		</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				<![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_4950" align="alignright" width="299"]<img class="size-full wp-image-4950" src="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/sleep.png" alt="Fitbit sleep" width="299" height="262"/> I went to bed close to 1AM, but my fitbit correctly detected that I didn&#8217;t actually get a chance to sleep until&nbsp;past&nbsp;4AM[/caption]
While I usually welcome routine and structure,&nbsp;I feel&nbsp;like I am&nbsp;wasting my days&nbsp;away&nbsp;in too&nbsp;much routine lately, to the point where every day feels the same.&nbsp;Perhaps it&#8217;s cabin fever from postpartum confinement&nbsp;that seems like time is dragging,&nbsp;and yet, he&#8217;s almost three weeks old, and I only have 10ish days left before I can freely leave the house (without feeling guilty or lectured at) whether to get some fresh air or a change in environment.
Even with help, I&#8217;m feeling drained and spent; I don&#8217;t know how single&nbsp;parents or&nbsp;those whose spouses&nbsp;are away do it &#8211; kudos to them. One huge advantage of the postpartum confinement practice is the help: I can get away from not having to do dishes, cook meals, change as many diapers,&nbsp;and entertain the toddler so I can&nbsp;feed the baby on demand,&nbsp;&nbsp;get some shut-eye to make up for the little sleep I get at night. When help &#8211; in the form of either set of parents &#8211; leaves, I worry most about how to juggle the sleep schedules&nbsp;with two (bad parenting habits on our part&nbsp;as some would say, as the toddler requires too much help to fall asleep). I also hope I can figure out a way to connect with my daughter again because right now, I feel like mommy doesn&#8217;t have fun with her anymore; instead, mommy is just around to help her do things (like change diapers, feed her, bedtime routine, take her to the toilet, wash her hands) &#8211; which is probably why she&#8217;s even more resistant to other people helping her do these things these days, and would on occasion&nbsp;breakdown or have an outburst as a result.
Lately, a typical day looks like: <span style="color: #008000;">feed baby</span>, <span style="color: #008000;">change diaper</span>, <span style="color: #ff9900;">eat a meal</span>, <span style="color: #ff00ff;">feed toddler</span>, <span style="color: #008000;">feed baby</span>,&nbsp;<span style="color: #ff00ff;">put toddler&nbsp;down for a nap (short bedtime routine)</span>, <span style="color: #ff9900;">power nap or laundry</span>, <span style="color: #008000;">feed baby</span>, <span style="color: #ff00ff;">tend to toddler who has woken up within the hour</span>, <span style="color: #800080;">change diapers on both</span>, <span style="color: #ff9900;">eat another meal</span>, <span style="color: #ff00ff;">feed toddler</span>,<span style="color: #008000;"> feed baby</span>, <span style="color: #ff00ff;">persuade the toddler to fall sleep (long bedtime routine)</span>, <span style="color: #008000;">feed&nbsp;baby</span>, <span style="color: #ff9900;">some down time and snacks</span>, and repeat the following until the morning:&nbsp;<span style="color: #008000;">feed baby</span>,&nbsp;<span style="color: #ff9900;">nap</span>, <span style="color: #008000;">feed baby</span>,&nbsp;<span style="color: #008000;">change diaper</span>, <span style="color: #008000;">feed baby</span>,<span style="color: #ff00ff;"> settle&nbsp;toddler</span>. (<span style="color: #008000;">green</span>: baby, <span style="color: #ff9900;">orange</span>: me, <span style="color: #ff00ff;">pink</span>: toddler)
Nights are the hardest because when I&#8217;m not sleeping, I silently will&nbsp;my&nbsp;husband to share in&nbsp;misery&nbsp;instead of&nbsp;serenely sleeping away or wonder why my toddler&nbsp;can&#8217;t easily&nbsp;be consoled by&nbsp;daddy when she wakes up&nbsp;in the middle of the night (and decides to cry for an hour instead). &nbsp;I know these aren&#8217;t very nice (or godly) thoughts&nbsp;and I know it gets better eventually, but it doesn&#8217;t mean that they escape me.&nbsp;There has been a week of reprieve, where he actually followed a nice 2-3 hour feeding schedule, and slept nicely in between.&nbsp;<del>Sadly, it didn&#8217;t last and&nbsp;was too good to be true.</del>&nbsp; At the time I started writing this post,&nbsp;he decided to feed every 1-2 hours nightly for a few days likely due to a growth spurt, but last night, it was nice to be back on a 2-3 hour sleep cycle again (funny how 2-3 hours is what to look forward these days). Though, it&#8217;s nice to have caught up with my Netflix playlist as a result.
The past few weeks have gone by quickly in terms of baby&#8217;s growth: he lost 10% of his birth weight, but recovered 1 kg within a week. Perhaps it&#8217;s because the midwife wisely waited until he grew a bit before doing the heel poke&nbsp;for the newborn tests, but he didn&#8217;t even flinch or cry when she drew blood.&nbsp;While he easily tucked into my arms before, his feet now stick out when he&#8217;s feeding. He gurgles and snorts and makes all sorts of funny expressions and noises, and while he slept through all sorts of background noises the second week, it seems like he&#8217;s&nbsp;starting to want to be held more during the day. He&#8217;s also prone to burp and regularly spit up (even from his nose, poor guy), which I guess makes up for all the two times Bean did.
This is why babies are hard work! I&#8217;m reminded why I started to enjoy being with and interacting with Bean more&nbsp;after she was 6 months old &#8211; by then, I probably would have a better hang of things&nbsp;with two as well.]]&gt;		</p>
