<h3>Gen Con: Thursday through Sunday</h3>


I started off my first day of Gen Con with two non-gaming mini workshops on the art and method of zentangle; everyone else stormed the exhibit hall when it opened. I had a great time doodling with a purpose! The rest of the day, I strolled through the exhibit hall collecting freebies, browsing the booths, and demoing a couple of short games.
Other than me joining the audience to watch an interview with the puppeteer and voice of Big Bird and Oscar the Grouch (who knew that they were played by the same person!) and his wife [ref] &#8211; there was an entire puppet stream / track at this convention, and the puppeteer and voice for Kermit the frog and Ernie (both played by the same person) was also there which I missed! [/ref], for the next couple of days, j.w and I spent most of our time together to look around the hall and demo games (at the hall and CGE/Rio Grande rooms); I found myself playing more games when with another person around than on my own.

We stopped for a bit to see the cosplay contest for the first time as we missed out on the parade as our True Dungeon game took longer than expected &#8211; wow, some people are truly dedicated at hand making their costume!


<h3>Games</h3>




<h4>Notes for next time</h4>




<ul>
    

<li>the C n C booth resells Rio Grande games; you can bargain with them.</li>


    

<li>Cool stuff inc has a dings and dents (or last stock) shelf that they restock throughout the convention. You can also use the $2 off coupon in the coupon book with these games.</li>


</ul>




<h4>I would consider buying or playing again</h4>

<ul>
    

<li><a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/257527/trapwords" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Trapwords</strong></a> (coming out in the Fall sometime) &#8211; advanced taboo, best played with people you know</li>


    

<li><strong><a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgameexpansion/233891/ticket-ride-map-collection-volume-6-france-old-wes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ticket to Ride: France</a></strong>: the tracks aren&#8217;t colored ahead of time, so you use one action to assign a color <i>but</i> your opponents could claim it before you do!</li>


    

<li><strong>Roll for the Galaxy: Ambition</strong>: extra cards and goals to complete. I regret not picking this one up at $23 &#8211; $2 at the dents and dings shelf at Cool Stuff Inc. because I wasn&#8217;t sure how it would play and didn&#8217;t know its retail price (later found out it sold elsewhere at the convention for $40). If they reminded me of the $2 off coupon, I would&#8217;ve picked it up. Though, pro-tip, don&#8217;t do as I did: don&#8217;t play and drink for you might roll your drink cup (filled with coffee in my case) instead of your dice cup. Though now that I know Amazon.com has it for $24, thanks to someone telling me about <a href="http://boardgameprices.com">boardgameprices.com</a> at the consignment store, I don&#8217;t feel as regretful.</li>


    

<li><strong>King Domino: Age of Giants</strong> (expansion)</li>


    

<li><strong>drop it</strong>: quick game to play, can play with kids, but hard to master, but would only get it if it was on sale, as the sticker price was $30 USD</li>


    

<li><strong>Cities of Splendor</strong>: adds a bunch of expansion games to Splendor, but would only buy this if we get a copy of Splendor. We&#8217;ve been playing Splendor on our phones / tablet after a friend taught us how to play, but the feel of the game is nice</li>


    

<li><strong>Word slam</strong>: A team vs. team game where you use existing word cards to try to and get your teammates to guess the correct word without using any gestures or your voice. It seemed to get a bit repetitive after a few rounds, but I like word games, so I&#8217;d be willing to give this one another try.</li>


</ul>




<h4>Did not get a chance to try</h4>




<ul>
    

<li><strong>Queen Domino</strong></li>


    

<li><strong>King Domino: Age of Giants</strong> (expansion)</li>


    

<li><strong>Terraforming Mars</strong>: I heard it has a Race for the Galaxy feel to it!</li>


    

<li><strong><a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/244330/scarabya" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Scarabya</a></strong><a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/244330/scarabya" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> &#8211; by Blue Orange, the same publisher and designer of King Domino.</a> I did meet the game designer in person, and it was sort of interesting to see that everyone at the booth was from France except for one American, even though they have an office in Silicon Valley.</li>


    

<li><strong>trash pandas</strong>: I only found this intriguing because I like the art of Sushi Go and the others at the Gamewright booth like this one looked cute, and was sold out on the first day.</li>


</ul>




<h4>Games I tried that I probably wouldn&#8217;t pay money for</h4>




<ul>
    

<li><strong>Catan VR</strong> (needs an Oculus set first)</li>


    

<li><strong>Small World: Sky Island</strong> (too many pieces! would be more fun to play on a tablet or smartphone)</li>


    

<li>Other expansions of Dominion (too many cards! but fun to play anyway)</li>


    

<li>Escape-room type card games. I feel like these are one-time plays and thus a waste of resources</li>


    

<li><a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/141791/pinata" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Pinata</strong></a>: a two-player game that seems kid-friendly but gets really repetitive quickly (maybe that&#8217;s why it&#8217;s perfect for a mother-daughter game); the consignment store had it for $12</li>


    

<li><strong>Chicken Cha Cha Cha</strong>: relies on a lot of memory &#8211; great for a younger audience</li>


    

<li><strong>Codenames: Duet</strong> &#8211; is a fun game but the group game seems more fun</li>


    

<li><strong>True Dungeon</strong> (TD): when j.w played it the first time, he came home raving about it. I think with the rise of escape rooms, I&#8217;d rather spend my money there (works out to be around the same price per hour). TD was a RPG/D&amp;D+Escape room hybrid: you&#8217;re in the dark going from space to space with divider walls draped with fabric to match the theme to separate the rooms; there&#8217;s a dungeon/game master in each room that yells out scenarios and penalties and then some random actors dressed up in themed costumes. I randomly died in the middle of the game (turned into stone after a low die roll), which mean I couldn&#8217;t participate in 3 out of 6 or 7 rooms, so I feel like I got ripped off somewhat.I felt like there was little to no onboarding for new players (had no idea what happened, and when to dock myself life). At the beginning, we spent a considerable time trying to figure out what our given random tokens meant and how to suit up our character by trading our tokens with others as each one had a special ability or armour/weapon. I wish they explained it better that certain tokens are more valuable than others, such as the purple ones, which are ultra rare (1 in every 100 packs), so you don&#8217;t trade them away. Thankfully, j.w had played before so he pocketed the purple one that I had opened (instead of giving or trading it away) and later found out that it sold for $75, but the buy price was $35, so I guess we got back most of my game. At least I contributed to solving a puzzle fairly quickly before our time was up.</li>


</ul>

<ol>
    

<li><strong><a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/98229/pictomania" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pictomania</a></strong>, newest edition (surprised that it was j.w who wanted a copy because it&#8217;s a group game and you have to draw!) &#8211; a hybrid of pictionary and speed where everyone in the game participates at the same time.</li>


    

<li><strong><a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/28620/phoenicia" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Phoenicia</a></strong> &#8211; by the same designer as Race for the Galaxy. Hadn&#8217;t heard of it &#8211; only picked up because it was $10 at the consignment store [ref] future note to self: every day a board game stays at the consignment store, it drops in price[/ref]</li>


    

<li><strong>Pressure Cooker</strong> &#8211; from Rio Grande, looks like Overcooked and for $10, it&#8217;s worth the try
[caption id="" align="alignright" width="680"]<img class="size-medium" src="https://geekandsundry.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/everdell.png" width="680" height="582" /> Image from <a href="https://geekandsundry.com/build-your-new-home-with-critters-and-cards-in-everdell/">https://geekandsundry.com/build-your-new-home-with-critters-and-cards-in-everdell/</a>[/caption]</li>


    

<li><a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/199792/everdell" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Everdell</strong></a> &#8211; definitely my favourite game from our purchases. I hadn&#8217;t heard of this kickstarter game until we passed by the booth on the last day. The artwork was what drew me in first as it reminded me of why I read some graphic novels, then phrases like tableau building, worker resource placement, Race for the Galaxy meets 7 Wonders / Agricola were the right words to hear. This was a game I was willing to pay a lot of money for! The designer, James Wilson, and his wife was there explaining the game and signing the collector&#8217;s edition. I learned that they&#8217;re from Idaho and Gen Con was their first big-city experience. He does embroidery printing as his day job, and that he&#8217;s worked on this game for over 5 years now. They had hoped to sell 100 copies at this convention, but they had sold over 1000 copies by Sunday morning! (so far, I have yet to win a game though <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f641.png" alt="🙁" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> )</li>


    

<li><strong>Race for the Galaxy: Xeno Wars</strong> &#8211; turns out we already have this expansion, but we hadn&#8217;t gotten around to playing with the extra pieces yet, so I didn&#8217;t recognize the cards (but found the box to be very familiar &#8211; and that was why)</li>


    

<li><strong>Robits</strong> &#8211; a kid-friendly $3 game for $1 because we had a $2 off coupon</li>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				<![CDATA[Think daiso, dollar store, aliexpress, plus any facebook mama co-ops, all mixed into one site; one that actually has a better mobile experience than a desktop one - that's <a href="http://wish.com">Wish</a> for you.
I came across the Wish site and app through a Facebook advertisement, and was intrigued because the products were similar to what the co-op groups were selling (often from China) and at much lower prices.  So, I googled. Reviews were mixed, with many poor ratings from consumers, but <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/ryanmac/2016/12/07/wish-ceo-compares-shopping-apps-success-to-donald-trumps-victory-confirms-500-million-investment/#4546098793b3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">write-ups on tech</a> and <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/ryanmac/2016/12/07/wish-ceo-compares-shopping-apps-success-to-donald-trumps-victory-confirms-500-million-investment/#4546098793b3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">business sites</a> and <a href="https://www.therecord.com/news-story/7108343-six-uw-grads-have-founded-firms-worth-more-than-1-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mentions in local sites</a> / <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/stories/waterloo-math-alumnus-named-forbes-top-40-under-40" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">UW</a> seemed to be positive in terms of its success and business model. I gave it a chance though because I ended up finding out that the cofounder and co-CEO was a former colleague/MSN Messenger friend from my UW language lab days, with whom I eventually lost touch with after he moved to Toronto[ref]&#8230;because how many &#8220;Danny Zhang&#8221;s are there in the world, and what are the chances? turns out it was the one I knew[/ref] &#8211; I attribute my impulse buy of Yahoo! stocks to his indirect influence (which ended up tanking and then only finally evened out a couple years ago, at which point we promptly sold it) ← this is to say that I trust-ed him. He&#8217;s a super smart/hardworking guy, so I was super excited to learn about this (ad)venture!

<ol>
    

<li>Refund policy on goods that do not arrive by the promised date. I just learned that <a href="http://bc.ctvnews.ca/delivery-delays-online-customers-waiting-months-for-orders-from-china-1.3441778" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">packages tend to take forever to clear customs in Canada</a> in general and not necessarily because of Wish itself, so it often doesn&#8217;t get delivered until past the expected date &#8211; one of my first packages was delivered within a month to Kitchener, but it stayed in some facility for two months, and then only came after I got my refund. You do need to stay on top of it and open a support ticket to request a refund though. I have received 6 out of 18 items so far before the expected arrival date; the rest have been refunded &#8211; some of which have since arrived while the rest are still missing or in limbo / la-la-land somewhere. My theory is that their algorithm will self-adjust based on when you tell them that you&#8217;ve received an item (after the expected arrival time has passed, it will ask you if you have received it and if so, when), so that eventually, they will estimate a more accurate (and likely more lengthy) shipping time so you don&#8217;t keep getting free goods.</li>


    

<li>Additional discounts  &#8211; it uses the psychology of limited time offers (and limited quantity offers) to persuade you to buy something. For example:


<ul>
    

<li>Group buy pricing &#8211; cheaper if you buy with someone, or if someone buys with you, you get a rebate to be used on your next purchase (by a certain time)</li>


    

<li>Instant offers &#8211; cheaper by a very small amount if you buy it within a set time</li>


    

<li>Promotional pricing &#8211; the more you buy and the more you review, the more points you get towards leveling up. Every time you level up, you get a discount &#8211; which expires after a certain time</li>


    

<li>Cart savings. <strong>Pro-tip:</strong> if you do not need to buy something right away and there is no timed discount offered, leave it in your cart and keep going to your cart and leaving your cart. Some time later, you will be offered an extra 5% off if you buy it right away</li>


    

<li>Spinning the daily discount wheel &#8211; it seems to be based on items you have viewed or have in your cart, discounted for 10 minutes</li>


</ul>


</li>


</ol>


What do you need to watch for?

<li>Don&#8217;t buy anything you need if you need it by a certain time; if history is a good predictor, it can and will take months &#8211; see first point in the section above.</li>


    

<li>Look at the price &#8211; many times, it advertises &#8220;up to&#8221; a certain % off (either 50% if a referral, or 20%), but I haven&#8217;t actually gotten anything more than 5% off, and I&#8217;m not even sure how to get it up to the advertised discount. Don&#8217;t trust the regular prices &#8211; they&#8217;re over-inflated, and research your prices before buying even with the discounts; sometimes, you can get it locally or elsewhere for about the same price or even lower. And click on the Related section/tab to see if other stores with similar ratings sell it for a lower price. Remember, Wish is not a single store, so if you&#8217;re reading negative comments about products from the Wish site, you need to remember that it&#8217;s likely dependent on the reseller / shop and not Wish itself (similar to Aliexpress, eBay, Amazon).</li>


    

<li>Reviews. My own rule is to read each product&#8217;s reviews and only buy something that is 4 stars or more with the more ratings the better (ie. 100+), unless you are willing to take the risk and throw that money away should it not meet your expectations. You need to pay for shipping if you send back an item, so most often than not, it&#8217;s not worth it, so I don&#8217;t buy big-ticket items.</li>


    

<li>It&#8217;s hard to track down a specific item, unless you know how to search for it; if you are just browsing, it&#8217;s a better shopping experience</li>


    

<li>Clothing sizing is often in Asian sizing. I&#8217;m Asian, so next time I might just go with that because <a href="https://www.wish.com/c/557a85dc8b8cb34ac6ebd5c0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a L dress ended up too big</a> in the bust area despite reviews saying it&#8217;s really small (I&#8217;m a US XS, so I&#8217;m probably 2 sizes up as opposed to 3). I&#8217;ve been trying to avoid buying adult clothing just because you can&#8217;t try it on first, but I find children&#8217;s clothing to be easier to buy as I can always buy larger and hope they will grow into &#8211; that and the price point for children&#8217;s clothing is generally lower.</li>


    

<li>Know that most products are made in China; they may not be the best quality, and you may be getting a product that is like its brand-name counterpart (or counterfeit &#8211; some product rating comments will say that despite the advertised brand, it&#8217;s not the quality they expect from that brand).</li>


    

<li>Support, other than on shipping, seems to be miserable &#8211; you get a different rep at each interaction and the reps sound like they follow a script so response is slow and frustrating. Case in point: I tried to get technical support because the app said I had a discount that would be automatically applied before a certain date, but I tried adding items to my cart and the discount wasn&#8217;t being applied. I did get an email reminder saying that the promo would expire in a few days (before the posted date) so I asked them to send my feedback to the technical team; the Zendesk Help thread is still ongoing.</li>


    

<li>Wish is not just one app / site &#8211; they have a few others focusing on different offerings: geek, home, mama are a few of the segmented branches. However, the user experience is a very disconnected, lacking SSO (single sign on) which means you need to create a separate account for each one and your point and level history starts at 0, despite it selling the same items at the same prices &#8211; for the most part. I have noticed that the separate apps tend to be more experimental first (A/B testing?) &#8211; for example, all items used to have a base cost, with shipping to Canada about $2-$3 for a small package. However, in the separate apps one day, I noticed the same item had $0 cost but the shipping went up by $1-$2; the final total was either the same, or cheaper by $1, so I ordered through the separate app. A few days later, this model was applied on the main site / app (for marketing effectiveness, it does seem that the &#8220;you just need to pay shipping&#8221; model is more enticing than a product that costs money with a lower shipping cost). So my<strong> pro-tip</strong> advice, is that you can look on the other more focused apps / sites if you&#8217;d like, but use the main Wish app / site to buy so you can keep your points in one place (for faster discounts), and you can keep a track of your purchases all in one place.</li>

If by now you are as curious as I was about this Wish site, and you haven&#8217;t signed up, download the Wish app (on phone, don&#8217;t sign up via desktop browser), use promo code <em>dpvwsfd</em> to save <em>up to </em>50% off your first purchase &#8211; do let me know if you actually save 50% , because I&#8217;m thinking you&#8217;ll save at most 5%.]]&gt;		</p>
