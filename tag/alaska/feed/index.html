								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				We&#8217;re back from our first family vacation on our own, and what a memorable way to start paternity leave / duo parental leave!&nbsp; For those who have doubts about traveling with an infant, I can now say that traveling with a 10-month old is perfectly doable, as long as your schedule and activities are a bit flexible. When we were deciding on destination options after narrowing it down to a week-long cruise, we opted out of Europe because it would mean more walking around and the Caribbean because of the time of the year, so we chose to visit Alaska instead.<br />
My husband opted to take one month parental leave, which I am very thankful for, as we got a chance to bond as a family, with the first half in Alaska and Vancouver and the last week and a bit hanging out at home. I felt very spoiled to not have to cook (except for cooking wild sockeye for dinner one time, which we thoroughly enjoyed), clean, or do housework while on vacation and for the first time in a very long time, we had enough sleep, retiring early in the evenings and napping when the little one napped during the days at sea.</p>
<h3>Celebrity Millennium</h3>
<p><figure id="attachment_4027" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4027" style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-large wp-image-4027" src="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/IMG_0274-1024x682.jpg" alt="Celebrity Millennium at Icy Strait Point on a rainy day" height="426" width="640"/><figcaption id="caption-attachment-4027" class="wp-caption-text">Celebrity Millennium at Icy Strait Point on a rainy day</figcaption></figure><br />
Initially, I had wanted to cruise with Holland America, after hearing so much good reviews with them, but we ended up settling with Celebrity Cruises instead. Even after we booked, our travel agent managed to find a better deal: Little Bean cruised for free, plus we got a stateroom upgrade for the same price! Seeing that we would be limited to our cabin when Little Bean was sleeping, we paid a premium for a balcony so that we could sit outside and read or appreciate the view despite the chilly weather &#8211; though of course, after staying in a balcony stateroom from our honeymoon, we haven&#8217;t been able to downgrade again.<br />
This line was also an upgrade to the other cruise lines we have traveled with in the past, and despite my initial reservations about them being owned by Royal Caribbean (which we had negative experiences with on our previous cruise), we were very happy with our experience overall.&nbsp;Aside from the glitches at the beginning with a non-functional stateroom fridge and missing baby food (yes, you can pre-order baby food jars beforehand at no extra charge!), this one seemed less in-your-face cheesy, the decor less tacky, people were more orderly (less chaos on the &#8220;shopping nights&#8221;), and the food quality and execution to be better (the pastries and desserts at the café were a highlight, especially the almond croissants). Service seemed less forced, but wasn&#8217;t absent either; dining room staff went above and beyond to switch us from set time dining (and shared table) to our own table flexible dining times, and our server brought Little Bean her own plate of food that wasn&#8217;t even on the menu (avocado, watermelon, and other melon cubes) even though we always had a jar of baby food with us. We were pleasantly surprised that we got a complimentary tour of the kitchen galley, unlike other cruise lines, and learned just how vast the kitchens are and how much is made from scratch (including the lovely pastries and desserts)! I also appreciated that the activities they offered on board went beyond activities like basic ballroom or napkin folding, like basic watercolours, and that you could borrow toys from the children&#8217;s area for the duration of the cruise. Furthermore, if your wee one spent any time in the children&#8217;s area, playing with any of the toys, they took care to disinfect it at the end of the day (provided the parent tossed it into the used-toys bin).<br />
Okay, so the targeted demographics on this cruise line is definitely not your Disney or Royal Caribbean Oasis/Allure of the Seas ships; there are no rock-climbing walls, water slides, zip-lines, carousels, costumed characters, or cinematic theatre under the stars (the latter mayhaps because of the chilly weather, seeing that the outdoor pool was also closed). But, the performances, though not Broadway, were solid; j.w was impressed that the lead performers could both sing and dance at the same time. With the limited options for evening activities, that meant that we could retire early without feeling that I missed too much. I was certainly surprised to learn that this cruise was the first cruise for many of the older folks we met!<br />
Little Bean made new friends quickly: Maria, the host at the dining room, the Metropolitan; Azem, the assistant Maitre&#8217;D (who just adores babies, and even introduced her to his fiancée over from the Q&#8217;Sine to meet her on the last night, which I thought was the sweetest thing); and little Emma, daughter of a God-fearing&nbsp; father who serves in the Air Force, and whose Christian mother shared about her struggles with transitioning to a stay-at-home-mom.</p>
<h3>The Weather</h3>
<p><figure style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/aimeili/14299623020/"><img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2896/14299623020_8a36595a36_z.jpg" alt="" height="480" width="640"/></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">A rainy day at Icy Strait Point</figcaption></figure><br />
Although we had hoped for sunshine and warm weather (which they had a week before our sailing as we heard from one of j.w&#8217;s former pastors that he randomly bumped into at the Anchorage airport),&nbsp; the clouds and rain followed us for the most part, but it didn&#8217;t deter us from seeing the sights; in fact, I think because of it, we met less people along the way. God kept us dry for the most part though and gave us sunshine in patches, which meant staying cool and having more dramatic photos; the day it poured, we were either watching whales from our balcony, or driving along the Skagway highway (we had a different view on the way back, when it cleared up!). The $8 stroller cover also kept our little one dry. Plus, we had almost a week of sunshine and warmth in Vancouver!<br />
The inclement weather may have been the reason for the rocky waters during the first two days from Seward to Juneau; I just ended up sleeping early when I started to feel it in the claustrophobic washroom in our stateroom. Turned out that many others fared worse &#8211; the mom we made friends with had to skip the rest of her dinner, and one of the shows had to be postponed to another day.<br />
So, what did we see in Alaska?</p>
<h3>Alaska &#8211; Glaciers</h3>
<p>When we first chose Alaska, I had doubts with the destination choice as my mother didn&#8217;t seem to like the itinerary when they went a decade ago; she had found the ports relatively uninteresting. However, she did say her favourite part was visiting Hubbard Glacier, so we made sure that was included in our itinerary. Ironically, I was actually disappointed with it the most, perhaps because I was expecting a grandeur that my mother had described. Sadly, perhaps it is because of the environmental impact and decay over the last decade or because of the poor weather, but we didn&#8217;t get as close to the glacier as expected and it looked much smaller and less majestic than the photos that my parents had of it when we compared photos later. Fortunately, we managed to see a few other glaciers as well, including Trail Glacier as seen from the train trip from Anchorage to Seward, Exit Glacier in Seward, which you can almost touch when you walk right up to it, and Mendenhall Glacier in Juneau.<br />
<figure id="attachment_4045" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4045" style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/IMG_7727.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-4045" src="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/IMG_7727-1024x682.jpg" alt="Mendelhall Glacier,  Juneau" height="426" width="640"/></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-4045" class="wp-caption-text">Mendelhall Glacier, Juneau</figcaption></figure></p>
<h3>Alaska &#8211; Wildlife</h3>
<p>Oddly enough, one of my favourite ports was Icy Strait Point, a fishing village that is close to Hoonah that&#8217;s really only dedicated to cruise ship traffic. The sights to see around the port didn&#8217;t seem all that terrific, especially on a rainy day, but we were rewarded with views of whales along the shoreline <em>and</em> from our balcony. We returned to the ship much earlier than the sailing time, but we had great views of pods of fin whales despite the rain. Apparently on the port side, those in the buffet dining room and on a kayak excursion had a treat; they saw with 6 whales playing together, whereas we, on the starboard side, saw 3 at a time.<br />

We also saw many bald eagles flying about throughout our trip, notably in Icy Strait Point and in Juneau (the capital city of Alaska, where no roads lead out of Juneau; you can only arrive via air or sea). Most of the other wildlife we encountered was during our 5 hour train ride from Anchorage to Seward: a family of grizzlies, a black bear, mountain sheep, and young caribou dashing across the pond. The one other &#8220;wildlife&#8221; we came across was a family of slugs in Ketchikan, which I found amusing that people were grossed out over them on Facebook, but perhaps I grew up seeing slugs everywhere that it merely served as a reminder of the West Coast climate.</p>

<p>*Hubbard Glacier and Inside Passage was just a cruising day / day &#8220;at sea&#8221;</p>
<h4>Anchorage</h4>
<p><figure style="width: 172px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/aimeili/14711863121/"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3915/14711863121_b3f34fc6ae_m.jpg" alt="" height="240" width="172"/></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Alaska Railroad on tilt-shift / toy-mode</figcaption></figure><br />
Anchorage, the closest airport to our departure port is 5 hours away by rail, which was one of the most rewarding trips by train I&#8217;ve taken &#8211; with incredible views of wildlife, glaciers, and other scenery. Because we travelled on a day that didn&#8217;t have too many passengers, we were able to sit in the bubble car for the majority of it instead of our assigned seats. For the city with an international airport, I was surprised how small it seemed; the Grand Anchorage hotel looked to be further from the train station on the map, but it was just a 5 minute walk away.</p>
<h4>Seward</h4>
<p>Seward was a much quainter town, and I ended up really loving our stay at <a href="http://sauerdoughlodging.com/the-sleeper/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sauerdough Lodging</a>, aside from the pack n&#8217; play looking very dirty, the layout of the place was perfect for us: the futon couch happened to be on an incline, they had a lounging chair perfect for nursing, and the kitchen was separated enough for us to cook (the fresh wild sockeye salmon) and enjoy our meal while the little one slept; that night was one of the few nights that we stayed up late enough to see the skies get dark (after 10pm). They were also the folks who told us about the free shuttle that Seward offers.<br />

Bob may be your uncle, but our BOB really pulled through for us, especially on our hike to Exit Glacier. We decided to buy one right before our trip, and I had enough fitness credits left to claim it on my work benefits insurance plan. We took it with us and it really served us well; I found that it was easier to maneuver and that it felt lighter than our 10lb Peg Perego Aria even though it is a 25lb stroller, and Little Bean seemed quite comfortable in it.<br />
<figure id="attachment_4029" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4029" style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/L1050385_edited-1.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-4029" src="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/L1050385_edited-1-1024x768.jpg" alt="In Seward on a rainy day" height="480" width="640" srcset="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/L1050385_edited-1-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/L1050385_edited-1-300x225.jpg 300w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/L1050385_edited-1-768x576.jpg 768w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/L1050385_edited-1-1568x1176.jpg 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-4029" class="wp-caption-text">In Seward on a rainy day</figcaption></figure></p>
<h4>Juneau</h4>
<p>We rented a car for the day ($30ish) and drove to see Mendenhall Glacier and the falls, and also visited Alaskan Brewing Company, which offered 4-5 generous glasses of samples of their beers, but sadly, I don&#8217;t drink that much alcohol. We lugged a case back with us (choosing to put the case in the stroller over the baby and carrying her instead since she was lighter), but we had too much stuff to bring back from Vancouver so we had to leave a few in BC for now.<br />
<figure style="width: 376px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3905/14452969941_c7a5f2e100.jpg" alt="" height="500" width="376"/><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Some opted to get closer to the glacier</figcaption></figure></p>
<h4>Skagway</h4>
<p>Instead of taking the $200+ White Pass Yukon rail excursion, we opted to rent a car for $80/day and drove a similar scenic route.&nbsp; Now, I can say that I&#8217;ve been to all the provinces, except Manitoba and one territory! Even though we put in hundreds of kilometres on the car in terms of mileage, the drives were quite leisurely &#8211; along the mountain roads and every so often, you&#8217;d be rewarded with a view along the pull outs. Memorable stops include Fraser, BC (one of the most hassle-free border crossings ever), the Yukon sign, Carcross (desert dunes and for lunch), and Emerald Lake &#8211; the color of the water living up to its name.<br />
<figure style="width: 500px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2900/14485012612_bfc0bcb964.jpg" alt="" height="333" width="500"/><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">joseph A view in Skagway near the airport (the foot path takes you to a fitness circuit on a trail!), with our ship in the background</figcaption></figure></p>
<h4>Icy Strait Point</h4>
<p>Unless you do a kayak excursion or you happen upon some whales (as mentioned above and as shown below), there doesn&#8217;t seem to be much to see at this stop.<br />
 Open mouths of fin whales, as seen from our balcony</p>
<h4>Ketchikan</h4>
<p>Although one of Ketchikan&#8217;s signs says that they get a lot of rain, we actually saw sunshine at this port. Being the Chinese that we are, we made good use of the $4 fee to use the funicular for a 60-second ride up to the hotel by taking it up a few times, and then hiking down two different short trails. Though on our last hike, we walked up the stairs in the middle of a &#8220;street&#8221; (the street IS the stairway) and took it down. Creek Street is probably the most unique area, and according to repeat cruisers, you can practically wade through the salmon that swims upstream there if you come at the right time (later in August?). We also found an extensive outdoors (thinking shoes and outer wear gear) store near the port, which had some good deals as well.</p>
<h4>Vancouver</h4>
<p><figure style="width: 500px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/aimeili/14455214004/"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5502/14455214004_b2bf5a951a.jpg" alt="" height="333" width="500"/></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Downtown Vancouver, in the distance</figcaption></figure><br />
Well, what did we do in Vancouver? We ate a lot, as usual, and visited our friends in the Seattle area again. I really enjoyed the duck confit at the French restaurant that my sister told us about, Café Salade de Fruits &#8211; great value: good prices, portions, and taste.</p>
<h2>Milestones</h2>
<p>Little Bean sprouted a number of teeth (2-3?) while on vacation, but it didn&#8217;t seem to bother her all that much except for the week leading up to them poking out. She also got better at standing supported, especially for long periods of time while playing on the activity table (we found it to be very good for her development so we ended up getting a similar one once we got back!)<br />
In the category of food, we&nbsp; discovered that she uses her pincer grip without any problems (using her forefinger and thumb to pick up food like avocado and watermelon bits), and likes to feed other people her food too. Like her mommy, she seems to love bread &#8211; this discovery was purely accidental; our table for 2 was small, so the dishes are often close to her high chair. When the basket was put down on the table, her hand reached out and grabbed a small loaf bun and quickly stuffed it in her mouth. She showed us that she could &#8220;clap&#8221; (applaud) and point at things which captivate her attention. Towards the end of the trip, it looked like she managed to sip from a sippy cup, but she drank water from a cup directly with much less effort, though the way she does is still like how she suckles. We were also very surprised that she seemed to know that certain things were not food, like when she played with sand for the very first time &#8211; she didn&#8217;t try to put any of it into her mouth!</p>

PS. Finally got around to posting about our trip. Month 11 has flown by too quickly, with the highlight being a visit from my sister and niece. Oh, and happy birthday, Prince George!		</p>
