<p>Six months ago, our littlest had an IgE blood test: one nurse took his blood, the other stood by in case he needed to pin him down. I covered my son&#8217;s eyes, she took blood; he flinched at the poke, didn&#8217;t move until it was done and when asked by the nurse if it hurt, he answered, &#8220;nope,&#8221; and looked at them as if to say, &#8220;what, is it supposed to hurt?&#8221; Turns out, he did far better than some adults they&#8217;ve seen.</p>


<p>The report came back, and it was negative for milk, which suggested that  his chance of having an anaphylactic / severe allergic reaction to dairy was less than 25%. I was hopeful! After all, he had some accidental encounters with dairy a handful of times without severe reaction, but there&#8217;s the rub &#8211; his skin didn&#8217;t do as well, and reacted with the milk with the skin prick test . And, this is why you can&#8217;t rely on a blood test alone; that&#8217;s why an allergist has to consider the history of and individual (how they&#8217;ve responded to the allergen in the past) with a combination of tells before making a diagnosis.</p>


<p>When he finally weaned this summer, I happily jumped on the dairy bandwagon again &#8211; with a grilled cheese sandwich as the dairy product that I wanted to celebrate with first. Sadly, it was a variant of a jalapeno popper that wasn&#8217;t as satisfying as a grilled cheese would have been. A few weeks later, I noticed that the skin around my neck was starting to get red, patchy, and quite itchy at times; I&#8217;ve only had eczema around my neck once, and it was during my academic years, so I had figured it was stress induced.</p>


<p>Yet, it seemed to get better when I limited my dairy intake, but flared up again when I  threw caution to the wind over the holidays. I suspect it just might be my body responding to the reintroduction to dairy as some foreign matter. The allergist, in brief conversation, asked me if I was allergic to milk as a child. Why yes, I had recently discovered that while I knew my mother didn&#8217;t know I was allergic to milk until much later &#8212; even though I was vomiting after having any, I didn&#8217;t realize that the doctor didn&#8217;t suggest this to her until I was almost 3 years old! (that might explain why I don&#8217;t like milk now, even though I like many other dairy products). </p>


<p>I expect that if a naturopath confirmed my food sensitivities, she might recommend avoiding the foods that trigger an autoimmune response. Yet, the allergist recommended that if it was only a skin response, that I shouldn&#8217;t eliminate it completely, because he had found in his experience that if children cut out the foods in their diet, and then came into exposure with it down the road, the reaction ends up being a lot worse than before. This is what I wanted to hear, I suppose, because that means I can still have dairy &#8211; but perhaps in moderation.  My family doctor suspects it&#8217;s all related to the chronic skin conditions that I have elsewhere on my body, but I suppose one can never really know; all I know is that the skin is just a visible sign that something is awry with your autoimmune system &#8211; it might be your gut, might be something else inside</p>


<p>The allergist has given the green light to proceed with the oral challenge with the littlest next month, but in a hospital setting in case he needs treatment, so here&#8217;s to hoping &#8230;and praying &#8211; God knows what He&#8217;s doing!<br /></p>

				<p>Another year has flown by and has it been one of growing:</p> <p>We&#8217;ve had the joy to watch Little Brother be a part of the family, and influencing his sister to creatively explore boundaries (Bean&#8217;s thinking: what? the mattress can be a bouncy castle? and the couch seats can come apart and be a landing mat? Let&#8217;s do it!).</p> <p>Language literacy: from broken English at the start of the year to full-on conversations with his sister in English (almost) all the time, which is way too much &#8211; but as Bean observed, the parents speak to each other in English all the time as well. He surprised me when he verbally counted to 10 in both French and Spanish as well; I&#8217;m also surprised that he manages to get through an hour of weekly Cantonese classes!</p><p>I credit his recognition of numbers from 1-8 to the numbers of the trains, and his colour-recognition also to Thomas. We&#8217;ve</p> also seen his keen interest in music and singing (but not others singing while he&#8217;s singing), and in storytime and books. I especially cherish the times, when he says sorry and means it (he also smart about saying sorry to get out of trouble) and at meal times, particularly when he is enjoying his food, he asks who made it and thanks the person who did! <p>Motor skills: from falling down stairs to mastering riding a tricycle; from solving puzzles patiently to picking up art activities like colouring (scribbling) and playdough; from playing with his trains &#8211; Thomas, to zooming around with Lighting McQueen and his Hot Wheels cars and car wash garage station, and firetrucks; from taking off his clothes by himself to putting on his shirt, jacket (and zipping), socks, and boots by himself.</p> <p>Pretend play and following his sister: it&#8217;s really confusing when they&#8217;re addressing each other around us as he&#8217;s the baby and she&#8217;s the mommy/mama. But, it&#8217;s so endearing when they get along and act in their assigned roles &#8211; him being so forgiving without seeming to mind that she&#8217;s bossing him around for the most part. Though he&#8217;s a preschooler, he&#8217;s truly still the baby when it comes to falling asleep and sleeping independently.</p> <p>This upcoming year will our last with him before he enters school; I think he&#8217;ll be ready when September rolls along!</p>		]]></content:encoded>

<p class="has-drop-cap">When you ask Little Brother how old he is, he holds up two fingers, and confidently says, &#8220;Three!&#8221; While I find myself correcting him almost every time, mathematically, I suppose he isn&#8217;t incorrect.</p>


<p>At the age he is at now, he&#8217;s starting to identify colours (or colors, for my American friends). He knows &#8220;black&#8221; and &#8220;wipe&#8221; (white), and maybe he knows the others too, but when you ask him what shirt he&#8217;s wearing, or what colour Daddy is wearing today, he might respond with &#8220;Thomas!&#8221;, &#8220;Percy!&#8221;, or &#8220;James!&#8221;. Some days, he might mention Emily or Stephen / Rocket too. It just so happens, those are the colours of  Thomas the train and friends; so, I suppose he isn&#8217;t incorrect.</p>


<p class="has-background has-very-light-gray-background-color">I&#8217;ve come to realize that although Bean doesn&#8217;t often show affection towards people, she deeply cares and loves her little brother. This side of her shows when we are trying to threaten him or put him in time out, she pleas that we don&#8217;t carry through (&#8220;I don&#8217;t want him to go to the hospital&#8221; or &#8220;don&#8217;t leave him!&#8221;) or wants to follow him into time out and be with him. So, in case you missed it &#8211; because I almost did: her favourite colour is no longer green, but currently, &#8220;Thomas&#8221;; I think his is James &#8211; because she has designated the red train in our set for him. He likes trains, so now, she does too.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				That&#8217;s our office cat in the photo. I&#8217;m one month in. And yet, it feels like a lot longer than that. I&#8217;ve found a rhythm that works with this new routine, and I&#8217;m thankful that both our kids have adjusted well too. Consequently, we transitioned our oldest to full day kindergarten, and after some trial and error, we dropped her afternoon nap, we eat dinner earlier, and they go to sleep earlier. Unfortunately, our youngest still wakes up at night and asks for food then, but our oldest seems to fall asleep faster and stays asleep throughout the night for the most part. This week has been one of the few germ-free weeks this year, so it&#8217;s a nice relief to not have to deal with that (if it wasn&#8217;t him, it was her, and if it wasn&#8217;t either of them, it was us or our daycare) &#8211; I&#8217;m grateful that our workplaces are pretty flexible when it comes from work from home policies and taking time off / emergency days, so we pretty took turns staying home with one child or both children. How do working families who don&#8217;t have backup plans / caregivers manage?<br />
At the beginning, it sort of felt like I was starting at a new school in the middle of the school year; I had a lot to learn and a lot of faces and names to remember. I still have a lot to learn and faces and names to remember, but it feels like I&#8217;m making an impact. I&#8217;m also thankful that I enjoy my work, so it&#8217;s easy to wake up earlier and rush out the door.<br />
We will have to find a different routine come summer, but so far, it&#8217;s been working out just perfectly. I&#8217;m glad I scaled back my hours (before signing the offer) because it turns out if you&#8217;re driving a car for school pick-up, you pretty much have to arrive in the neighbourhood at least 20 minutes early in order to find available street parking around the perimeter of the school; otherwise, you&#8217;re pretty much out of luck. And even though I get off at 2:30PM, by the time I get everyone home, it&#8217;s 4PM. I then give them a small snack, work on unloading the dishwasher and getting another load in, and starting supper. By the time we are done dinner, it&#8217;s close to 7PM, and we play a bit then bathe (if applicable), and then off to bed. After that, I clean up the kitchen (pack food away, prep lunches) and maybe wash or fold the laundry. I&#8217;ve been doing laundry on weekends in loads, so I can just sit and binge-watch Netflix (working through The Crown) while folding.<br />
Surprisingly, I find myself dozing off before midnight and using the computer less after work (but still on my phone) &#8211; maybe it&#8217;s because I no longer have mid-day naps or work is more tiring than staying at home (though I feel it&#8217;s a break / nice change from home life). I&#8217;m on a modified work week, and I&#8217;m already wondering how full-time working parents do this every day and survive? I applaud those families!<br />
Other than work and school, we started going to a different small group / life group, which has changed to an earlier start time, which means for the first time in a long time, we actually get to stay past dinner. We have also started going to another church, primarily because Bean is at an age where she is learning, and I simply can&#8217;t go on teaching her every week &#8211; and when I don&#8217;t, I hear implied comments about going to a different church anyway. I&#8217;m a little sad, but since I also miss fellowship time because I&#8217;m watching them after service is over while everyone else is chatting and because people don&#8217;t tend to eat together for lunch as much anymore, I&#8217;m not really connecting with anyone either. I know Bean misses it because on occasion, she tells me she wants to go back to Simply, or that she wants me to be her teacher that day, and every time we pass by St. Paul&#8217;s, she points out that it&#8217;s our church. Finding a new church to call home is hard. Personally, I don&#8217;t like the format of the sermons by the lead pastor at this new church so far (grossly paraphrased: partial verses are taken from different translations to fit into the sermon&#8217;s points) though the supporting pastor actually goes into a passage in contrast, but the kids seem to have adjusted so well even at the first visit and a lot of effort is put into the children&#8217;s spiritual wellbeing and education. So yes, 2018 is going to be a year of change and adjustment.</p>
<hr />
Two years ago, we were celebrating <a href="http://her.happyhippos.ca/2016/02/two-month-milestones/">two month milestones</a>. Now, at 2, he&#8217;s come a long way:</p>
<ul>
<li>Speaks in complete sentences. Has started to communicate (and copy) in English. Boo.</li>
<li>Enjoys climbing and doing crazy things and will deliberately test boundaries with people in authority (me &#8211; he&#8217;s heavy so I can&#8217;t just pick him up and grab him while grocery shopping for example, so I don&#8217;t go when I&#8217;m on my own as it&#8217;s impossible to get more than one or two things in one trip)</li>
<li>Loves to sing, and can sing many songs in English including the Alphabet song, Twinkle Twinkle Little Star, Away in the Manger, Roly Poly and can sing along with or recognize songs by Walk Off the Earth, Moana, and Frozen.</li>
<li>Loves trains, especially Thomas. And cars. And airplanes. Prefers trains though, if given a choice.</li>
<li>Easily sucked in by technology: photos on the phone, TV, iPad game, and YouTube videos. One time early on, the caregiver gave an older child a tablet to use while the younger ones were supposed to nap; he had a meltdown and refused to sleep. Then she figured out why (we had warned her prior so she made the connection and no more problems since).</li>
<li>Has not completely weaned. So, I&#8217;m still off dairy and some nuts. Nuts!</li>
<li>While he started off with liking meat, he doesn&#8217;t seem to like meat (fish the exception) as much anymore, unless it&#8217;s chicken nuggets/fingers/crispy. He will still eat it but when it is in chunks, he tends to pick it out. He also doesn&#8217;t like green fiber veggies, but will repeatedly down it in smoothie form. Like his sister, he loves fruit. Avocados, bananas, and cereal with alternative milk are now his favourite breakfast foods. He is a soup and rice monster. Sometimes noodles too.</li>
<li>Self-toilet training is hit and miss so far &#8211; and if successful, it&#8217;s still only #2 (though a few times, he wakes up with a dry diaper and will go if you put him on the toilet); progress seems to have slowed down or regressed especially now that he doesn&#8217;t tell his caregiver he needs to go (or maybe she hasn&#8217;t learned the signs yet)</li>
<li>He may have had a mini <a href="http://her.happyhippos.ca/2017/04/the-day-we-had-our-first-ambulance-ride/">febrile seizure</a> the other week, when he had a slight fever (while fighting off strange rashes &#8211; maybe mild symptoms of hand, foot, mouth + reaction to lactose in Tylenol) but it lasted no more than a few seconds and it was in his sleep.</li>
<li>He seems interested in people he knows (and babies) &#8211; often willing to share a toy, asking for someone by name, offering hugs to those he loves (except it&#8217;s sad to see hugs not reciprocated, especially when his sister comes out from dance class and he goes to hug her and she brushes him off; however, she always asks to go into timeout with him when he&#8217;s in trouble), and enjoys helping out in the kitchen (putting dishes away, watching and helping mommy cook/bake)</li>
<li>He must have shorter legs or something, because he fits his age in tops when it comes to sizing but his bottoms are behind a bit.</li>
</ul>
<p>I&#8217;m amazed at how fast our children is growing up, now that we all have slightly different routines and that they are no longer babies.		</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				And, I hope it will be our last, and I hope this will the first and last time I have to call 911 for an emergency response. Come to think of it, that was his first time at a hospital too, since he was <a href="http://her.happyhippos.ca/2015/12/its-another-baby/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">born at home</a>.<br />
A couple of evenings ago, our little one had a <a href="http://kidshealth.org/en/parents/febrile.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">febrile seizure</a>. I didn&#8217;t know that was the name of it at the time, but I had two fleeting thoughts: &#8211; what was it that I read about seizures in young children during illness &#8211; was this it or something else? and &#8211; I hope I don&#8217;t have to ask for our hand-me-down baby clothes back. During the episode, I felt so helpless watching his limbs twitch, his eyes roll back repeatedly, and his lips turn blue. Shortly after we laid him down on the floor, during the call with dispatch, the seizure stopped but his eyes looked glassy, his gaze off in the distance; he fell asleep despite us talking to him and he didn&#8217;t even notice his sister jumping to get his attention. I cheered inside every time his chest rose up and then down, confirming that he was still breathing.<br />
And for those wondering:</p>
<h3>What was the ambulance ride like?</h3>
<p>The inside of an ambulance is surprisingly spacious, with ample room to seat at least 5 passengers with seat belts, and there&#8217;s a <a href="http://www.fernoems.com/en/search-results/pedi-mate.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">child-restraint system</a> for ambulance cots! Though, with rather limited windows and with the small view whizzing by when I tried to look out to see whether we were, I found myself getting a bit motion sick. We were the first call on their shift. As the ambulance door closed, I could only offer a weak smile to the neighbour who walked out to see what was going on (I found out later, they asked j.w if everything was okay and invited them over and offered to babysit if needed). If the $45 ambulance bill is not covered by OHIP or extended health, it&#8217;s a fairly reasonable cost: $755 cheaper than having a fire truck come on scene, and $35 cheaper than for one in our area in BC.</p>
<h3>What happened at the hospital?</h3>
<p>We were placed in our own room with a bed to rest on in the acute care department of the emergency ward  &#8211; I guess that&#8217;s one advantage of arriving via ambulance: <a href="http://www.grhosp.on.ca/care/services-departments/emergency/current-emergency-wait" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">you don&#8217;t have to sit in the waiting area</a> and deal with triage directly. His temperature was noted at 38.8C (which isn&#8217;t the highest it&#8217;s been). One of the paramedics instructed me to put him on the bed and wanted me to stand or sit in the chair, but thankfully, the nurses let me pick him up, which calmed him down (and kept him from falling off the bed!). For the most part, he wasn&#8217;t too miserable &#8211; I mean, you&#8217;d feel uncomfortable and probably want to cry too if they poked you, put you in some confining <a href="http://www.piggostat.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">x-ray contraption</a>, and put a catheter in you. The blood work showed low bicarbonate which may be related to his crazy <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f4a9.png" alt="💩" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> episodes in the past couple of days (diarrhea, the doctor thinks), and chest X-rays suggest something viral in the chest, possibly early pneumonia, which might have been from his cold a couple weeks back and could explain the wet cough they overheard. The doctor consulted the pediatrician and decided that no antibiotics were needed at this time since he&#8217;s still himself, for the most part anyway (thankfully because antibiotics can cause a bunch of side effects including yeast infection in the diaper area &#8211; but I&#8217;ve supplemented with probiotics anyway since he had diarrhea). Pee dip test came out clear. Overall, we had a nice mother-son bonding time once I was given the okay to pick him up and hold him.<br />
Despite us having to wait 5 hours for tests and results to come back, and with little updates unless I asked, towards the end of the evening, a nurse held my son while she faced the other way in the washroom so I could relieve my relatively full bladder, and even gave me a sandwich, some juice, and some fruit for us to eat, when I asked where I could buy some food to fill our rather empty stomachs (the little guy promptly fell asleep once he satisfied his hunger)[ref]this episode happened just as we were sitting down to eat dinner so we missed it[/ref].<br />
Towards the later parts of the evening, one distressed and very vocal fellow ended up in the same ward as us. One of the nurses told me that on weekends/Saturdays especially, and during later parts of the night, they often see people who don&#8217;t know where they are, or are elsewhere mentally because they&#8217;re either drunk or on way too much drugs, and sadly, the many of the latter are young people.<br />
PT took us home as it was late by the time we left and j.w had stayed home with Bean. Since then, DS has symptoms of a cold in addition to the fever, which comes and goes.<br />
Overall, I am very pleased with the response rate and care that we received the other night by Grand River hospital and by the paramedics.</p>
<h3>What are we to watch for now?</h3>
<p>The doctor instructed me to bring him back if he had another seizure within 24 hours, if we see him have any difficulty breathing, or if the fever doesn&#8217;t dissipate within 5 days. I was also advised to make a follow-up appointment with our family doctor the next week. If we notice less wet diapers, she suggested 1:1 apple juice to water ratio as a cheaper and tastier but equally effective alternative to pedialyte.</p>
<h3>Will it happen again? Does it affect their development? Will they get epilepsy?</h3>
<p>Sadly, the chances of another febrile seizure happening in the future is 1 in 3 (33%) now that he has had one. Both the internet and the doctor tells me that it&#8217;s fairly common in young children in response to a fever past 38C and it doesn&#8217;t seem to harm them. Our relatively laid-back child now has both allergy and febrile seizure risks (to balance out his easy-going nature?).  His chance of developing epilepsy according to the doctor is double, moving from 1% to 2%, which is still quite low: it won&#8217;t happen 98% of the time.</p>
<h3>What happened before all this started?</h3>
<p>Before the seizure, he seemed like his usual self, though he has seemed sad after every time he soiled his diaper for the past day or so (every one was was poopy) especially when I asked him about it, and he vomited once while crying on the toilet (I thought it was from crying, not from being sick). He hadn&#8217;t quite shaken his cough from a couple weeks back, but it didn&#8217;t seem to bother him and it was only on occasion, so I thought it was just residual coughing. He was maybe a touch warmer than usual, but I&#8217;m usually able to tell if he has a fever just by feel, so I&#8217;m not sure why I didn&#8217;t notice it; it probably didn&#8217;t help that he was wearing a wool cardigan. He woke up from his late nap after being transferred to j.w so I could make dinner, and shortly after j.w put him in the high chair, I heard, &#8220;I think he&#8217;s having a seizure&#8221;. I suggested moving him onto the ground (which the doctor assured me that was the right thing to do), called 911 since it was his first time and we weren&#8217;t sure what to do &#8211; I figured I could use the verbal coaching if I needed to do infant/baby/child CPR. He definitely felt and looked a lot hotter by the time the seizure stopped and woke up crying.</p>
<h3>What to expect if it happens again in your care?</h3>
<p>Start timing it &#8211; it&#8217;s probably going to feel longer than how much time has actually passed. Falling asleep is normal as long as breathing is happening, and as long as he is responsive and &#8220;comes out of it&#8221; within an hour of happening, it&#8217;s really nothing to be concerned about[ref]I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;m going to be concerned every time it happens anyway[/ref]. Put him down on the floor and turn his head to side in case he vomits. If the seizure continues for more than 4 minutes, call 911. If it doesn&#8217;t last for more than 10 minutes, we don&#8217;t need to bring him in to be assessed but since it takes a few minutes for the ambulance to come, preemptively calling them after 4 minutes is okay.  Paramedics advised us to strip him down to diaper to bring down his temperature as well. The pamphlet the hospital gave us also told us not to put him in a bath to bring down his temperature and don&#8217;t put anything in their mouths; they will not swallow their tongue. If he&#8217;s feverish, give him the correct dosage of Tylenol / Advil to avoid peaking over 38C.</p>
<h3>P.S. As usual, God&#8217;s fingerprint was all over this.</h3>
<p>He prepared me for this in two ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>I was supposed to be out that evening watching a movie with a friend but because I forgot to arrange the logistics with j.w (dinner, rides, car, etc.) and because the kids were still napping past the time, I missed it.</li>
<li>I have been on a long wait list for a LTE WiFi hotspot router from the library. My hold finally came up the day before this happened and j.w managed to pick it up for me. I was thinking, &#8220;I&#8217;m not going anywhere this week, why would I need internet on the go?&#8221; Well, he thought to throw it into my hospital bag as I was rushing out, and thankfully I had it because I wouldn&#8217;t have paid $10 for internet for the 5 hours that we were there. It enabled me to keep family and friends up-to-date, and I was encouraged to learn that so many were praying for us &#8211; and asking if we needed any help! Thank you, as always 🙂</li>
</ol>
<p>I pray we won&#8217;t experience this again, but if it does happen, at least I know what to expect -sort of; I feel one can never be &#8220;ready enough&#8221; to get married, to get pregnant, to have kids, and now to parent, but I know I&#8217;m never alone in this journey.		</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				While he was very stoic and mono-expression before, Little Brother is becoming quite the character, is generous with his smiles, and has quite the appetite.[ref]despite not going up to a week, sometimes! :([/ref]<br />
Some things he enjoys:</p>
<ul>
<li>he prefers soft veggies like squashes over green leafy vegetables (too stringy / fibrous), all soft meat &#8211; chicken, pork, but not steak, fish, and almost all fruits, especially oranges[ref]portion-wise, he eats the same amount as his sister now, if not more![/ref]</li>
<li>looking at the world upside down</li>
<li>studying younger babies</li>
<li>shrieking in laughter, especially when his sister eggs him on</li>
<li>plunking at keys (computer and piano keyboards)</li>
<li>building with Lego and cars (more so than his sister did, but maybe because his sister is more interested in them now)</li>
<li>looking at pictures in books, especially when on the toilet (he asks for them by pointing to where they are stored)</li>
<li>sneaking up the stairs (while we were unaware), climbing and standing on chairs (probably seeing his sister do that) &#8211; he&#8217;s definitely less cautious than his sister &#8211; maybe a combination of being a boy, a second-child, and his own personality differences</li>
<li>helping mommy unload the dishwasher &#8211; cutlery is his forte, though sometimes he will &#8220;help&#8221; unload his cup by doing quality control on it first and pretending to drink from it</li>
<li>playing with water, especially when washing his hands</li>
<li>toddling around (now that he&#8217;s walking around with a lot more confidence)</li>
</ul>
<p>Month 14 and 15 seemed pretty significant:</p>
<ul>
<li>he took his first unassisted steps at around the 14 month mark (2 months sooner than his sister)</li>
<li>2 week long cold/flu, where he spat up a couple of times, but it coincided when our house was sick last year as well</li>
<li>at his check-up, he weighed in as being on the 25th percentile (5x his sister!), around 50th percent in height, but 70th in head circumference (<em>not my genes!</em>); the doctor did comment that they are actually more interested in head circumference than length since a spike in the head size curve could mean a tumor or something unusual in there</li>
<li>figuring out how to drink properly from a sippy cup (and turning it over and tapping liquid from the unsealed ones all over the tray)</li>
<li>&#8220;painting&#8221;[ref]using a brush and water to bring color in a magic book[/ref] for the first time</li>
<li>mommy feeding him mixed nut butter (no peanuts) with no reaction the first time, but breaking out in hives and redness that required two doses of Benadryl to calm it down &#8211; <em>sigh</em>, more allergens to watch out for.</li>
</ul>
<p>The doctor says that he&#8217;s supposed to say about 20 words by now, but while he&#8217;s not there yet (probably 3-4 words he says independently), his vocabulary seems to have exploded over the past two months. Resignedly, many of them are in English (sigh) as he&#8217;s picking up what his sister often says:</p>
<ul>
<li>babbling, with first words at 14 months that seem to be associated with a meaning, but often copied instead of independently said, like &#8220;bao bao&#8221; (bread, but I realize that his meaning actually encompasses all food), &#8220;wow&#8221;, &#8220;POP&#8221; (goes the weasel), <em>mum mum</em> (food, not me) and now it extends to ow, snack, <em>woh woh </em>(dog), <em>mao mao </em>(cat)</li>
<li>signing more (food) by tapping all his fingers together, like in a teepee</li>
<li><em>nein nein</em>: wants mommy&#8217;s milk (that&#8217;s how he greets me now too, not mama &#8211; I&#8217;ve been reduced to breastmilk, sigh)</li>
<li><em>ma ma</em> (paternal grandmother) (15 months) paired with <em>yeh yeh</em> (paternal grandfather), which he had started calling long before <em>ma ma</em></li>
<li>using certain actions for certain songs, at certain parts of songs (like lifting his arms &#8220;when they&#8217;re up they&#8217;re up&#8221; for Grand Ol&#8217; Duke of York)</li>
<li>plays word games by repeating after you like counting from 1-5, but only saying 1 or 5 repeatedly: him: <em>YUT, </em>me: <em>yee, sam, say, </em>him: <em>NG; </em>sometimes he just says 5 or 1 before we even get there</li>
<li>he also understands what you say, like go get the ball, but even when you&#8217;re not talking to him (such as if I said to his sister, go wash your hands, he suddenly decides he wants to be done with his meal too, or I talk about shoes and he goes and grabs some)</li>
</ul>
<p>A bittersweet stage: <em>our little boy is growing up!</em>		</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				In milestones news, I can&#8217;t believe how fast time seems to fly for #2. I think partially because he is the second child so it&#8217;s not as lonely, but also because at the back of my mind, I keep thinking&nbsp;that&nbsp;he may be our last baby (and thus, no more &#8220;baby&#8221; moments)!<br />
Now that he&#8217;s moved beyond 12 months, here&#8217;s what we have observed:</p>
<ul>
<li>No distinguable words &#8211; despite the <a href="http://www.ndds.ca/ontario" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NNDS guidelines</a> saying that we should recognize 3 words by 9 months. We don&#8217;t recognize any consistent words, although he has recently be saying &#8220;yeh yeh yeh yeh&#8221; when his paternal grandfather is around, so it might be a correlation. He&#8217;s also copied his sister and said &#8220;Dad-dy&#8221; or &#8220;dada&#8221; and other syllables, but they don&#8217;t seem to be repeated in any sort of associated pattern.</li>
<li>Can freely stand and cruise along furniture, with a walker or while holding your hand &#8211; the first time he did on a walker, he had a blast, laughed for half an hour; crawls like a limping dog</li>
<li>Has taken a few steps, seemingly unintending to &#8211; but like <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+14:29-31" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Peter walking on water</a>, once he realizes he&#8217;s taken a few steps, he stops and falls (or sits down).</li>
<li>Has given up the pacifiers completely</li>
<li>Dropped his morning nap, not by choice</li>
<li>Understands signs or follows your questions, like claps his hands to music though he first wiping his hands instead of clapping, taps his head for head, recognizes and looks up when I say, &#8220;light&#8221;, puts a phone to his ear when I say, &#8220;Hello?&#8221; and mimics mommy. When I say &#8220;mummum&#8221; or put him in the high chair, he immediately clasps his hands in prayer.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Enjoys playing games with you, like foot games and hand games</li>
</ul>
<p>In other news, Bean has self-designated herself as being a &#8220;baby&#8221; more often now, putting toys and teethers into her mouth (which she didn&#8217;t do), asking to be fed and held, crawling around (which she didn&#8217;t do), asked to be called her brother&#8217;s name and saying that the baby is the big sister, and mimicking baby coos.		</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				Today marks the end of steamed milk in my coffee, grilled cheese sandwiches, peanut butter pretzels and buttered popcorn, yogurt, ice cream, and other products containing milk, possibly soy, and peanuts in my diet until the end of our breastfeeding days, which&nbsp;might be for another year or more. While I only have to endure it until the end of our breastfeeding time together, our little one might have to watch his diet for the rest of his life &#8211; I&#8217;m sad for him, but at least he won&#8217;t have memories of enjoying those, so he may have less cravings for them, and hopefully better self-control (than I do!)[ref]I didn&#8217;t realize how much I regularly enjoy milk products until now, even though I don&#8217;t care for milk itself[/ref].&nbsp;<br />
I once suspected that milk might have been the culprit in his&nbsp;bouts of eczema and bloody stools[ref]though the latter might still be as a result of constipation[/ref], when he was known to spit up after every feeding (I would say mild reflux), and experienced three vomiting episodes after eating one serving of rice cereal that contained milk ingredients, but I was in denial; how could it be? My daily diet only consisted of milk in my one cup of espresso &#8211; or so I thought; I forgot about the cheese, ice cream, butter, everything else that has milk protein in it. I&#8217;m pretty sure I was in denial, so I didn&#8217;t&nbsp;cut anything in my diet, thinking that it wasn&#8217;t really an allergy, and like his sister, would outgrow it. Now, after a visit to an allergist and a positive prick/rash/allergy test, it&#8217;s official: he&nbsp;has a milk and peanut&nbsp;allergy.<br />
So now, our low-maintenance baby has become a high-maintenance one; I guess our &#8220;easy&#8221; baby was too good to be true. Yet, this news comes at a timely moment in our lives; we&#8217;re reading through&nbsp;<em>The Power of a Praying Parent</em> by Stormie Omartian (I keep thinking it&#8217;s &#8220;O&#8217;Martian&#8221;), and we just covered a chapter that talks about releasing our children to God, and this is an example of a very much an appropriate moment to follow her model of prayer: that if it&#8217;s in His will and in His time, that our son will outgrow both his allergies; but&nbsp;if not, will be managed well so that no one would ever need to use an epipen on him; but if so, that it is administered successfully and effectively.<br />
I&#8217;m still processing the news, so I didn&#8217;t get a chance to think of and ask the many follow-up questions that have since popped up (stemming from online research and what others have shared with me &#8211; yep, I&#8217;m also one of those internet moms), but here are some questions that people have asked and the answers I have come across:<br />
<strong>Q. Will he outgrow his&nbsp;allergy?<br />
A.&nbsp;</strong><a href="http://aacijournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1710-1492-7-S1-S7#Sec12" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Possibly</a>. Our allergist says that many children outgrow their milk allergy by the age of 5. I just found out&nbsp;that my siblings and I all had milk allergies until we were 1 years old, and our mother experimented by trying to reintroduce milk slowly and over time. However, only 20% of kids outgrow their peanut allergy. Because Bean seemed to have a milder reaction to peanut butter when she was younger, but outgrew it by 2 years old &#8211; which surprised him, the allergist suggested paying for a blood test to see if her brother&nbsp;would qualify for reintroduction of peanuts under clinical supervision; we&#8217;re praying that&nbsp;he&#8217;d be eligible. So, as of now, it is what it is &#8211; will just have to adapt to manage it.<br />
<strong>Q. How severe is his allergy?<br />
A.</strong> At the skin prick test, the one for peanuts was about 5mm, and the one for milk was slightly larger (6mm, maybe?); I think&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15482519" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the size indicates a positive diagnosi</a>s,&nbsp;but I didn&#8217;t think to ask. According to one site,&nbsp;&#8220;<a href="http://www.kidswithfoodallergies.org/page/food-allergy-test-diagnosis-skin-prick-blood.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">no test [&#8230;] can determine severity</a>&#8220;. Nevertheless,&nbsp;we&#8217;ve been advised to keep two epipens with him. While, I don&#8217;t know the criteria for what makes an allergy a risk for anaphylaxis, we have&nbsp;seen <a href="http://aacijournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1710-1492-7-S1-S6#Sec4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">symptoms matching the criteria in Table 3, section 2 (GI and skin symptoms)</a>&nbsp;and <a href="http://aacijournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1710-1492-7-S1-S6#Sec3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">in this table</a>.<br />
The allergist&nbsp;prescribed two injectors (<a href="http://www.kidswithfoodallergies.org/page/newly-diagnosed.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">as does this site</a>), but I think&nbsp;most people I know only carry one. Although he does not meet <a href="http://aacijournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1710-1492-10-40" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the minimum recommended weight of 15 KG (33 LBs)</a>, the allergist still recommended that over a self-administered antidote citing that human / user error is very common. He then used an ultrasound machine to measure the thickness of muscle between the skin and the bone, to make sure that our son&#8217;s thighs is fat enough &#8211; more than 13mm &#8211; <a href="http://aacijournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1710-1492-10-40#Sec2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">so that the injection won&#8217;t hit bone</a> (and bone marrow, which is equivalent to a IV administration and that&#8217;s bad); he was 16mm. Another option is available (TwinJet?) but is supposedly the same dose.<br />
<strong>Q. Is there no other option other than Epipen? What about Benadryl?</strong><br />
<strong>A. </strong>The allergist and online sources tells me that&nbsp;Benadryl won&#8217;t help with breathing, but it may help reduce other symptoms (e.g. puffy eyes, lips).<br />
<strong>Q. What can he drink instead of milk, to get the fat content and other nutrients that is in whole milk?<br />
A.&nbsp;</strong>My dietician and online sources say that breastmilk is best so to keep breastfeeding for as long as possible. As long as we have the go ahead to eat soy, we can also have soy and coconut milk; there&#8217;s rice and almond milk as well. I&#8217;ve tried hemp milk, and it tastes like grassy straw, which I&#8217;m not a fan of at all. Fortified alternatives provide at least 30% calcium and some fat content, but it doesn&#8217;t completely replace milk&#8217;s benefits; it&#8217;s also a shame that many companies use carrageenan (or xanthan gum, but not as bad) to thicken their drink, and add sea salt to flavour it. I have to remember to continue to supplement him with Vitamin D. For good fat, I will likely have to be more creative, using oils like avocado or olive, and serving more salmon (frozen filet steaks of wild Alaskan salmon is readily available from Kirkland / Costco year-round, works out to be 10$/lb which is reasonable)<br />
<strong>Q. What about formula?<br />
A.&nbsp;</strong>Online sources seem to suggest that if a baby has a milk allergy, baby may have a higher likelihood of developing a soy allergy, so switching to a soy based formula may end up increasing the risk.<br />
<strong>Q. Can he have lactose-free, cheese, or yogurt? What about goat&#8217;s or sheep&#8217;s milk?<br />
A.&nbsp;</strong>Unfortunately, the allergy is to the milk protein, not the lactose. Most people with milk allergy is to cow&#8217;s milk protein, but I&#8217;m not sure if we have the go-ahead to try other kinds of dairy.<br />
I did mention that I had accidentally fed him vegetables cooked in butter a couple of times and failed to see a reaction, to which he was surprised, so as a result, he told me keep to doing it, but don&#8217;t go beyond what I normally would have done. We will likely have to monitor him very, very closely if we do that &#8211; not to mention, we&#8217;ll have to watch&nbsp;him even more closely when we aren&#8217;t the ones providing his meal / food. Though, I wonder if he&nbsp;can tolerate <a href="https://aacijournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1710-1492-8-5#Sec1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">extreme heated milk products</a>&nbsp;&#8211; will have to ask.<br />
<strong>Q. Can he have other nuts?</strong><br />
A. In theory, yes. Peanuts is technically a legume and not a tree nut (e.g walnut, pecan), but we have to be careful of cross contamination because they may be processed in facility that isn&#8217;t peanut free.<br />
<strong>Q. What about peanut oil?</strong><br />
<strong>A.</strong> I&#8217;m not sure about this one. Online sources say that pure unrefined peanut oil should be safe, but I need to check with the allergist about this one. Will likely have to avoid though,&nbsp;especially in commercial places, like restaurants &#8211; because can you be sure that it&#8217;s pure and unrefined?<br />
<strong>Q. So, are you a peanut and dairy-free household now?</strong><br />
<strong>A.</strong> Thankfully, complete elimination measures aren&#8217;t necessary at this time. In fact, the allergist told us specifically not to stop giving our daughter peanut butter! However,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.hamiltonhealthsciences.ca/documents/Patient%20Education/CowMilkProteinAllergyWhatToEatBreastfeeding-trh.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mom will also need to follow a similar elimination diet</a>, which will be a challenge, as she can&#8217;t eat anything from the allium family either (e.g garlic, onions, chives, leeks).<br />
<strong>Q.</strong> <strong>What can I do to help?</strong><br />
<strong>A.</strong> Pray for us &#8211; I (we) have no idea what I&#8217;m (we&#8217;re) doing. Trying to avoid garlic, onions, etc. is already hard; I&#8217;m also thinking that avoiding dairy will likely be more challenging than peanuts. And, if you eat with us, we especially appreciate that you take our dietary needs into consideration &#8211; understandably, it&#8217;s probably&nbsp;especially hard if you&nbsp;don&#8217;t need to conscientious of it in your everyday life; I&#8217;m sorry for the inconvenience. If you&#8217;re in a similar family situation, I&#8217;m open to hearing advice and your experiences too. Thank you!		</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				Wow. Having just returned&nbsp;from the Western Caribbean/Florida and trying to write a recap,&nbsp;I come across this post sitting in my draft. It looks like I wrote down some notes, but never finished it, and I&#8217;m not sure if I ever will, so let&#8217;s expand on some memories and post it now.</p>
<hr />
The decision to visit during the summer, during peak&nbsp;travel period wasn&#8217;t on the table but we did&nbsp;have vague plans to visit sometime to meet my sister&#8217;s baby&nbsp;and for the rest of my family to meet ours. As it turned out, my aunt was getting remarried and invited everyone to their banquet reception and the timing worked, so we redeemed aeroplan points for one way, and bought tickets back after school started so the prices were much better[ref]thankfully, we didn&#8217;t have to modify travel plans as&nbsp;some extended family members had[/ref]. &nbsp;At the wedding is where I get a 3-minute lesson from a cousin on whiskey-tasting 101: taking a sip straight up, then sucking in one breath of air after a sip, and finally with 1 drop of ice in the shot before taking a sip &#8211; each one delivering a different profile / depth.<br />
We all managed to get through the plane rides without too many tears. Bean sat in a car seat, which&nbsp;I much preferred her to be in than in a seat with just a lap belt; the height also allowed her to look out the window. She was happy to watch TV in silence (but no naps), and on the way back, we survived without having a seat back entertainment system &#8211; it also seems that the flight from YXX-Abbotsford is shorter by an hour! The baby was sure different from when Bean was his age &#8211; I couldn&#8217;t nurse him to sleep and keep him asleep; j.w&nbsp;had to help / intervene.<br />

Warm sunny weather welcomed us at the start of our vacation, which made the trip to the&nbsp;Sea to Sky Summit very worthwhile, as it was warm and skies were clear so you could see the views&nbsp;without having to hike up the Chief&nbsp;(photo: that&#8217;s neither me nor Bean). We then visited (enriched and encouraged by) our friends in Woodinville, as we traditionally do every time we&#8217;re out there, and every time, we&#8217;re reluctant to leave.<br />
Alas, the warm weather did not last, but held up enough so that when my dad&#8217;s car had a flat tire followed by a dead battery, I could take the baby out to the side of the road and wait &nbsp;&#8211; though we discovered that more people stopped because they saw me and the baby than when it was just j.w alone. And we all got sick, to the point where Bean developed hives and passed it to her cousin, and where I coughed so much coughed so much that the whole campsite heard me moan (dying cow?) in my sleep. We chickened out on the first day we were to set up camp (as it was damp and soggy and wouldn&#8217;t have helped my cold), and ended up joining our friends for 2 nights&nbsp;instead of 3. As it happens, we don&#8217;t generally hang out with too many families with young kids especially not all at once, so it took some time to get used to every child calling &#8220;mama, mama&#8221; and not wonder if it was Bean.<br />
<figure id="attachment_5393" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5393" style="width: 739px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class="wp-image-5393 size-large" src="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/IMG_20160903_193553_hdr-1024x768.jpg" width="739" height="554" srcset="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/IMG_20160903_193553_hdr-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/IMG_20160903_193553_hdr-300x225.jpg 300w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/IMG_20160903_193553_hdr-768x576.jpg 768w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/IMG_20160903_193553_hdr-1568x1175.jpg 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 739px) 100vw, 739px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-5393" class="wp-caption-text">Car camping in cold and damp weather is worth it when the warm sun finally comes out (or sets in this case).</figcaption></figure><br />
Bean and her cousin had a blast together, despite some tears throughout. We ended up staying at their place for the duration of our trip, so that the cousins could spend extended time together, and because my mom didn&#8217;t want our sickly germs prior to their cruise trip two weeks later [ref]to the point where I think I only saw her 3 times during our entire 3 weeks there &#8211; she probably figured she&#8217;d see us upon the end of their cruise anyway[/ref]. We visited the PNE &#8211; I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve been there since high school (the year I entered in some art contest, where my friend, Marie won!- and I took honourable mention). Since it poured, we stayed covered in the farm / agriculture area, where the kids get to go through stations and collect a treat at the end. I discovered that Bean was either afraid or didn&#8217;t like the (plastic) fish in her bucket as she would bury it at the bottom or not want to touch anything touching it.&nbsp;A momma pig looked happy nursing her many piglets, which made me think of the bond&nbsp;between breastfeeding mothers and babies and how it seemingly universal it is (though I wonder if they get latch problems too).<br />
Whether coincidentally or not, it seems that&nbsp;every time we visit my &#8220;home&#8221; church, major leadership changes happen: a pastor resigns or a new pastor comes on board; this time, they introduced a Chinese pastor &nbsp;and another&nbsp;English pastor announced his leave. In spite of the news, we both felt refreshed, as we were actually able to sit and listen to two sermons in a row, in its entirety without being interrupted by a baby (in the nursery) or a toddler (with her cousin and/or my sister in the toddler program). Furthermore, it was a series on marriage; a rare sermon topic at our church, likely because our demographics is mainly students. I don&#8217;t remember what it was about, except that we don&#8217;t pray as a married couple enough &#8211; but I&#8217;m guilty of not spending enough time with God one-on-one, so that would be a good place to start.&nbsp;<br />
During our visit, j.w started 3 months of parental leave; I was elated[ref]While it would have been incredible had he chosen to taken all 37 weeks &#8211; after all, it&#8217;s not often that one gets such an opportunity&nbsp;&#8211; he only wanted to take&nbsp;one month of absence from work for family bonding. I get it &#8211; I&#8217;ve seen the how (terribly) mothers are treated when they come back to work after a year of maternity leave &#8211; to a new team, new leadership, into a new assigned role and (worse) desk, and being away for less time should prevent that from happening; he also fears knowledge loss. &nbsp;However,&nbsp;we managed to negotiate it to three in exchange that I would watch&nbsp;Star Wars: the Force Awakens with him[/ref]. &nbsp;His parental leave began in the middle into&nbsp;our trip, and would end with another trip (sandwiching a road trip with friends midway).<br />
Bebe turned 9 months while we were visiting:</p>
<ul>
<li>this was the&nbsp;start of self-feeding / baby-led weaning; he pursed his lips and refused any pureed food; instead, he took to ribs and other chunky food</li>
<li>we found out that not all kiddie toilet seats are created equal, and had to order one from Amazon, where the curved seat prevented him from arching his back every time we put him on, which affected his bowel movements</li>
<li>bum shifting became a means for mobility</li>
</ul>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				Bebe has now spent more time outside of the womb than inside! I still&nbsp;marvel at the wonder of how Bebe managed to fit inside me and then the birthing&nbsp;process, which is only made possible through God&#8217;s design and handiwork.<br />
We&#8217;re also almost halfway through my husband&#8217;s three month parental leave, and I feel like we&#8217;ve accomplished nothing on our list, except travelling. However, it&#8217;s definitely a huge blessing that he&#8217;s home with the kids &#8211; taking them to the playground, putting one down for nap-time while I take the other, or letting me have some solo time or one-child time and he takes the other; the initial sacrifice of not having him around at the beginning is worth it, since the baby is in a much more interactive and fun stage. I&#8217;m thankful that our country allows the father to take up to 9 months off (without pay except EI unless your company tops it off), but few fathers I know take advantage of the allowance (citing income and/or knowledge/skill loss as the top two reasons). Though I wish that he took more time off, but it&#8217;s already 2 more months than I expected &#8211; in exchange, I just need to watch Star Wars: the Force Awakens.<br />
So, what have we learned about Bebe during the past two months?<br />
This baby crosses legs at his ankles while sleeping or lying down and scratches his head when he&#8217;s tired (a great visual cue!), but he&#8217;s done that ever since I could remember. He&#8217;s also decided to not take to the pacifier as readily now, either pawing away at it, turning his head, complaining, or spitting it out, either opting for no pacifier or his oft-preferred human pacifier (that would be yours truly &#8211; the human pacifier has milk&nbsp;and doesn&#8217;t taste like silicone!).<br />
Nine</p>
<ul>
<li>Wave hello and knows how to shake his head from side to side (when I say yes and nod, he shakes his head no) &#8211; both of these are games to him, as well as him pulling up his legs and kicking them down on the bed; he also really likes a rhyme in my mother&#8217;s dialect, <em>hoi-ping</em>&nbsp;(the only sentences I still know)<em>&nbsp;</em></li>
<li>Yoga poses, bum shuffle, bum pivot</li>
<li>at the end of the 9 months, he pulled himself standing inside the crib</li>
</ul>
<p>Ten</p>
<ul>
<li>Discovering different syllables and repeating them: &#8220;ba&#8221; was the first repeated syllable, now repeated &#8220;da&#8221;s and sometimes &#8220;eh&#8221;s</li>
<li>Third tooth appears in the bottom left of his mouth</li>
<li>Standing up on stairs landing</li>
<li>&#8230;more to come</li>
</ul>
