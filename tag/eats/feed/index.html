								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				I&#8217;m at the age where I&#8217;m comfortable with shopping and ordering online. And while I prefer to text and instant message people over chatting on the phone, I felt uneasy texting an unknown Toronto number to order a box of brownies for local delivery; so, my age is beginning to show, perhaps?<br />
The other day, I came across an ad on Facebook: the premise is that you text a number to order some treats (brownies in this case), and they deliver to your door. The conversation started on Facebook Messenger and then transitioned over to SMS, where I was able to order a box of dairy-and-nut-free, reduced-sugar brownies. Sure enough, that evening, a box of brownies showed up at the door, with a real person &#8211; the baker &#8211; behind it.<br />
My first SMS order was a success! And while I feel like this way might be more personal and a cheaper than ordering through an e-commerce site, traditional credibility (ethos) goes out the window, which impacts the professional image. It didn&#8217;t help that they wanted me to give an online review on a Facebook group in exchange for free delivery, and when they told me they took square (for credit card payments), I expected to pay with a credit card, but on delivery, he told me he didn&#8217;t bring it because everyone paid with cash (square charges a fee). I also took measures to use a throwaway SMS number as I didn&#8217;t want a business to have my personal mobile number for other marketing purposes.</p>

But I probably would order from <a href="https://www.facebook.com/bakehurry/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bake-Hurry</a> again &#8211; especially if they had a promo since dairy-free and nut-free baked treats are hard to come by! When local hipster cafes and bakeries start charging an upwards of $4 for a square brownie, a box of 24 decently sized pieces of freshly baked custom brownies for $30 (or $20 for first time customers) becomes a great price and I like being able to support our local small businesses. The way they are boxed makes them look homemade, but they do come from a rented commercial kitchen (Courtyard Kitchens), in the same building as <a href="https://www.fourall.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Four All Ice Cream</a> in Kitchener. I should have frozen some had I done some pricing research since they should last up to a month in the freezer or a week in the fridge. They do have a nice chocolately crunch on the outside with a soft chew on the inside, just as advertised, and just the way I like my freshly baked cookies. I&#8217;m glad I asked for reduced sugar because I found it sufficiently sweet &#8211; the regular version would probably have been too sweet for me. A friend commented on the texture, that it reminded her of mooncake, but perhaps that is because it is the dairy-free version?<br />
Same day (from order to) delivery is another win in my books, as it&#8217;s perfect for those cravings (for dessert, a sweet bite, or those midnight munchies &#8211; like right now) and last minute meal prep and I don&#8217;t have to go out to get them, especially if I don&#8217;t want to lug my kids around with me.		</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				It&#8217;s been almost half a year since our little one&#8217;s first diagnosis of&nbsp;<a href="http://her.happyhippos.ca/2017/01/we-are-one-of-those-families/">his peanut and dairy allergy</a>, so here&#8217;s our first update and a few lessons I&#8217;ve learned:</p>
<ul>
<li>The allergist called me one Saturday afternoon, which surprised me as I thought doctors don&#8217;t work on weekends?&nbsp; He told that the&nbsp;blood results for&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioallergosorbent_test" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the RAST test</a> came back: DS&nbsp;would likely have a 50% chance of an anaphylactic reaction to milk, and a 90% chance of peanuts. So nope, not qualified to take the peanut challenge at this time.</li>
<li>He appears to be allergic to other tree nuts, but I&#8217;m not sure which one. How do I know? I fed him a mixed nut butter from Trader Joe&#8217;s which has the following ingredients:&nbsp;Almonds, Cashew Nuts, Walnuts, Brazil Nuts, Hazelnuts, Pecans, Sea Salt; he didn&#8217;t react the first time. The second time? Instant hives, which only went away after two doses of Benadryl.&nbsp;Our next appointment is not until the middle of summer, but at that appointment, we can test for further food allergies like goat&#8217;s milk protein, and the nuts, though I suspect it might be walnuts as it seems that it coincides with peanut allergies; he&#8217;s had almond milk before without any reaction, as well as almond in Chinese soup.</li>
<li>And as mom and son are refraining from nuts and dairy, I have&nbsp;noticed that Bean has asked for dairy items less &#8211; she wants his soy milk, and doesn&#8217;t ask for cheese, milk, or yogurt nearly as often as before</li>
<li>And as a mom refraining from nuts and dairy, I have failed him at least once &#8211; which I feel incredibly bad about. &nbsp;As my body can&#8217;t tell if I&#8217;ve ingested dairy or nuts, it&#8217;s only when he reacts that I&#8217;ve known that I had something I shouldn&#8217;t have had &#8211; specifically, the time when a friend made a special bowl of pasta for me knowing that I couldn&#8217;t have garlic or onions, but she had forgotten I wasn&#8217;t able to have cheese. I didn&#8217;t want to refuse it, so we decided to scrape off the top of it with the melted cheese and I would eat the rest of it. Bad idea. Within 30 minutes of breastfeeding, he threw up. Lesson learned: learn to get over feeling bad for inconveniencing people</li>
<li>Another lesson learned: Be skeptical. When someone tells you that a batch of homemade goodies they received from someone else are said to be safe, but it actually wasn&#8217;t, you learn that it&#8217;s okay not to trust what people tell you.</li>
<li>And, if anyone tells you that there is no such thing as dairy-free chocolate (as I&#8217;ve been told), it&#8217;s a myth; you can find dark chocolate / cocoa without milk, although many varieties&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fda.gov/ForConsumers/ConsumerUpdates/ucm433555.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">might come with a risk</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Dairy alternatives</h3>
<p>Unfortunately, I&#8217;ve noticed that&nbsp;I tend to crave for more sweets because I can&#8217;t readily have them anymore, so in my quest to search for sweets and treats that I can have, I&#8217;ve come to realize a few things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Many products that are nut and dairy-free tend to be vegan and gluten-free. I guess, it&#8217;s a better cost-benefit to sell&nbsp;a product that meets multiple-dietary needs than just one or two.</li>
<li>Be willing to pay a premium for anything that isn&#8217;t mainstream; this is true of organic products, and any specialty products like these</li>
<li>While I initially enthusiastically tried some dairy-free alternatives, I now am wary of trying most of them as I&#8217;ve only found one or two that didn&#8217;t have a strange texture or aftertaste:
<ul>
<li>The <a href="http://sodeliciousdairyfree.com/products/almond-milk-frozen-desserts/mocha-almond-fudge-bars" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mocha almond fudge</a>&nbsp;&#8220;ice-cream&#8221;&nbsp;bar by So Delicious is surprisingly good, President&#8217;s Choice coconut milk-based &#8220;ice cream&#8221; in chocolate and mango is good and affordable; I have yet to try coconut; and, Belasoy dark chocolate pudding is tasty too!</li>
<li>Soy yogurt, coconut yogurt, almond milk yogurt &#8211; strange texture and aftertaste, and unusually sweet if fruit flavoured <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f641.png" alt="🙁" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></li>
<li>Fake cheese, either blocks, shredded, or sliced &#8211; they tend to be okay together with something like melted on top of a burger, but terrible on its own or where it&#8217;s highlighted, like on nachos; I wouldn&#8217;t buy it again</li>
<li>I had forgotten that&nbsp;<a href="http://blog.fatfreevegan.com/2011/10/what-the-heck-is-nutritional-yeast.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">nutritional yeast</a> can be an interesting alternative to make popcorn taste cheesy</li>
<li>The most surprising finds yet:
<ul>
<li>while Oreo and Pillsbury croissants <em>are</em> dairy-free,</li>
<li>many types of margarine are <strong><em>not</em></strong> dairy-free; the ones that are contain artificial flavours, colour and other strange additives &#8211; the <a href="http://www.becel.ca/en/becel/becelproducts/becel-vegan.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">vegan one by Becel</a> is the one I ended up buying and using for baking, but I&nbsp;prefer using coconut oil on my toast now over margarine</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>My favourite stores? Organic Garage in Thornhill, for their discount breads and discount milk alternatives when they&#8217;re close to expiry; and locally,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.cefoodexperience.ca/?page_id=29" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ce Food Experience and Bakery</a> where&nbsp;I encountered the most wonderful nut-free, dairy-free apple pie; her partner has multiple allergies, so they have a selection of safe treats to choose from, and <a href="http://www.sevenshores.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Seven Shores</a> for their vegan menu options (including vegan cheese and ease of subbing avocado for mayo for example) and baked treats (sometimes $1 day-olds).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>The UX of Labels</h3>
<p>I&#8217;m used to reading labels to see if a product has garlic, onion, etc. and how high and the sodium content on the nutritional value chart, but when I&#8217;m specifically looking for allergens, it&#8217;s so much easier when companies decide to highlight them. Here are a few design choices that I&#8217;ve encountered:</p>

<ul>
<li>Graphics and lists that tell you what common allergen they don&#8217;t have</li>

</ul>
<h4>And then, there&#8217;s the&nbsp;possibility that the product <em>might</em> contain a common allergen</h4>
<p><figure id="attachment_5681" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5681" style="width: 225px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipOnzRsfAoOR8UgSfTQi-pwSnOOWUISg8KMmJg3dBG8A81LetmyqRGJ8FMXxLn6hIg/photo/AF1QipPZEFVH7X6oEm2yBf7jJY7MBjKicmFrmuI5ubXC?key=c19hQmJWSlZhdXRENGdpWnU4d1lhRXBXOURVWG1n"><img class="wp-image-5681 size-medium" src="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_20170218_202116374-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300" srcset="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_20170218_202116374-225x300.jpg 225w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_20170218_202116374.jpg 738w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-5681" class="wp-caption-text">An oxymoron: these cookies are dairy-free, but watch out, they&#8217;re made in a facility that uses dairy&#8230;</figcaption></figure><br />
I have a love-hate relationship with the disclaimer on a product that tells me that it&nbsp;<em>may</em> contain an ingredient that isn&#8217;t listed, or that it&#8217;s processed in a facility or shared-equipment that uses those ingredients. This information&nbsp;is not regulated, and instead seems to&nbsp;be&nbsp;<a href="http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/fn-an/label-etiquet/allergen/precaution_label-etiquette-eng.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">volunteered information</a>&nbsp;&#8211; aimed to help consumers (but&nbsp;allows companies to cover their butts I&#8217;d say); it&#8217;s definitely important to know that a certain product may have been in contact&nbsp;with an allergen, but this information becomes useless in situations where the label isn&#8217;t helpful anymore.<br />
It does help when the labels tell me to consult the website for more information, or straight up <a href="http://sodeliciousdairyfree.com/allergen-information" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tells me&nbsp;what they do</a>&nbsp;on the label to make sure that there isn&#8217;t any cross contamination. If it&#8217;s made in-store, I often find that if I talk to the department in-person or call them, I can decide if I&#8217;m comfortable with their methods of cleaning, etc.&nbsp;I have come to trust[ref]perhaps foolishly especially knowing that this label is volunteered info[/ref]&nbsp;that if a certain brand of food always uses the &#8220;may contain&#8221; label, if this is absent in a product, I take to mean that there are no known possible contaminants.<br />
But, two labels come to mind that have thrown me in for a loop:</p>
<ul>
<li>This box of cookies that have a giant list of allergens that they&#8217;re free from, yet down below in smaller print, it says: &#8220;Made in a facility that uses dairy&#8221; so now, a little doubt creeps in over the credibility of the &#8220;dairy-free&#8221; claim.</li>
<li>Costco&#8217;s rotisserie&nbsp;chicken&#8217;s label tells me that it may contain ALL of the top allergens it seems: wheat, fish, milk, eggs, soy, shellfish, crustaceans, tree nuts, sesame, mustard. REALLY? So, I called our local Costco, and spoke to someone from the meat department who prepares these chickens, and he told me that they prepare the chicken in the raw meat room, so the only risk would be fish (shellfish, crustaceans, etc.). <em>Thank you</em>. I guess you can say everything that isn&#8217;t packaged in the store might be cross contaminated if they prepare food in an open bakery, but I don&#8217;t see bags of apples with those labels&#8230;</li>
</ul>
<p>I&#8217;ve started taking <a href="https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipOnzRsfAoOR8UgSfTQi-pwSnOOWUISg8KMmJg3dBG8A81LetmyqRGJ8FMXxLn6hIg?key=c19hQmJWSlZhdXRENGdpWnU4d1lhRXBXOURVWG1n" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">photos of labels that&nbsp;I&#8217;ve come across</a> as a digital artifact collection of sorts &#8211; you&#8217;re welcome to add to it.		</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				A few weeks ago, the main branch of the Kitchener Public Library invited Matter of Taste owners, Phong (and Dawn) Tran, to give a quick coffee-brewing workshop to a dozen or so guests. While I have experienced horrible customer service multiple times at the coffee shop itself (including with one of the owners) and have since stopped going (which saves me a bunch as we often opted to treat ourselves to Dawn&#8217;s special &#8211; the MoT pricier version of Vietnamese-style iced coffee), I commend them for crafting out time to share their insights with us.<br />
At the end of the night, I was surprised to discover that even if you use the same beans and the same weight of grind, depending on which method you use to make a cup of coffee, the end results can be so varied in look and taste. It&#8217;s also amazing how much more fragrant freshly roasted and ground coffee is! Our samples were from Ethiopia, roasted a day before and ground that evening.<br />
From my observations*:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AeroPress" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Aeropress</a>: coarser grind, paper filter, hand pressure<br />
Result: clean, no sediment, sweet after taste, dark in color, my favourite choice<br />
If you don&#8217;t have an espresso machine, you can get a cheater espresso with this device</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_press" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">French press</a> (commonly associated with the Bodum brand): coarsest grind, mesh filter &#8211; push down a bit first so grounds can soak and aerate &#8211; then let it sit for a few minutes before slowly plunging it the rest of the way<br />
Result: sediment at bottom of cup, lighter in color, similar in body/taste as Aeropress<br />
So if going for the same taste as Aeropress but want to save $ for the equipment, this would do / be a happy medium</li>
<li><a href="http://coffee.wikia.com/wiki/Pour-Over_Filtration_Brewing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pour-over</a>: paper filter &#8211; rinse with hot water first to take out chemicals in filter and to warm up the receptacle<br />
Result: Tasted more acidic (&#8220;citrusy notes&#8221; was how Phong described it). Clean, but I didn&#8217;t like the taste.</li>
</ul>
<p>Alas, I was too busy drinking up the shots, keeping mental notes and comparisons, and trying to keep up that I forgot to take photos for visual reference.<br />
*Note: Certain flavours&nbsp; may be more apparent to some and preferences may differ but the remark about different methods, different results hold true.		</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				Tomorrow marks the last day of this challenge and it sure wasn&#8217;t easy being constrained to being intentionally local, especially when others around you aren&#8217;t. The most frequently asked questions were, &#8220;<em>is this [considered] local?</em>&#8221; and &#8220;<em>why are you doing this?</em>&#8221;<br />
The second question is a bit easier to answer: aside from the <a href="http://www.baileyslocalfoods.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">free year&#8217;s membership to Baileys Local</a> and to support and participate with the community, I wanted to see if it would take a lifestyle change to live locally. With only a day to go (and $12 for cheating between the two of us, the biggest culprit for us being online entertainment like streaming and reading non-local blogs and eating), I&#8217;ve concluded that being exclusively local can be easy in some ways, but it would not work long-term for us if we had to do it day in and day out. T&#8217;was not for naught though, as we happened upon a few new discoveries along the way (<a title="#livelocalkw: Coffee &amp; The Great Outdoors" href="http://her.happyhippos.ca/2014/09/livelocalkw-coffee-the-great-outdoors/#comments" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@SKL</a> &#8211; this part is for you!): a place that sells beeswax (for my baking experiment that will hopefully happen), <a href="http://ambrosiapastry.com/about-us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a shop that sells <span class="st">canelés</span> (!)</a>, <a href="http://www.baileyslocalfoods.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">one more online option to order local/organic food</a>, and the manager that ran the sushi and sandwiches at the now-defunct Casa Mia is selling sushi (and other items) at the Y Café at the CIGI campus beside it (so not all is lost!)!<br />
In our quest to stay local this week, we discovered that not everyone defines local the way we do;&nbsp; for example, a well-intending parent tried to convince us that Ontario corn and carrots bought at a Walmart in Toronto counts as being &#8220;local&#8221;, and while Ontario-grown produce is great, Walmart is far from being local on my list, even if it had been bought at the Walmart in KW and even if Walmart employs staff that are from the city.<br />
And while there are plenty more great places around town to eat, shop, and play local, the following three ties up this blog series:</p>
<h3>Eat</h3>
<p>Generally speaking, I don&#8217;t like paying for cold sandwiches (or grapes, honeydew, cantaloupe, muffins, veggies that can be found on a veggie tray, har gow or siu mai) &#8211; this likely stems from eating deli sandwiches for lunch throughout most of primary and secondary school because our family owned a soup and sandwich restaurant and catering business (har gow, siu mai from daily dim sum lunches with the grandparents while in HK). However, I still enjoy hot sandwiches and the occasional cold ones &#8211; usually ones that don&#8217;t have deli meat in them.&nbsp;<br />
I especially like the housemade bacon-based sandwiches made at <a href="http://breadbaron.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">breadbaron</a>, a take-out stand that took over <a href="http://indulgekitchen.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Indulge Kitchen</a> at the Kitchener Market, but they cycle through a few sandwiches every so often, which makes sense as they can ensure fresh ingredients and do it well. . One perk is that after you order one sandwich, they give you a $1 off coupon to be used on a subsequent purchase there!</p>
<h3>Shop</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/Steckle/photos/a.152547468193790.30913.121778541270683/631374770311055/?type=1&amp;theater"></a> Steckle&#8217;s produce stand (Photo: Facebook)<br />
Well, since this is the last of the series, here are three other places apart from the typical supermarket chains that we buy our fridge and freezer food from:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.stecklehomestead.ca" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steckle Heritage Farm</a> when in season, sells their farm-grown veggies and root vegetables. Last year they had a novel concept where you just pay what you can or what you feel like it&#8217;s worth, but this year, they seem to have priced their harvest reasonably (and pay by honour system).&nbsp; The produce stand just sits near the entrance and is open to the public on Tuesdays between 3-7pm</li>
<li>Sustainable360.ca doesn&#8217;t require a membership fee (unlike Bailey&#8217;s) and while the selection isn&#8217;t as vast as Bailey&#8217;s, they do offer products that Bailey&#8217;s doesn&#8217;t sell and on par or cheaper than its online and in-store competitors (I&#8217;ve compared blueberries from the same farm, same volume, and it was $1 cheaper here than Bailey&#8217;s)</li>
<li>and a honorable mention to <a href="http://www.caudlescatchseafood.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Caudle&#8217;s Catch</a> &#8211; because I miss the seafood from Vancouver. Seafood isn&#8217;t local, but they do sell quality seafood, including wild-caught fish from the Great Lakes in addition to a variety of other farmed and wild fish (and other frozen and fresh seafood). While they are not swimming in a tank like Asian supermarkets, they get shipments weekly and they often look fresher than the dying fish in those tanks anyway; they will also gut and clean/scale the fish for you in store, and can cut up a whole fish for you the way you like it, if you give them a day or two notice (e.g. filets and steaks)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Play</h3>
<p>I love that our library is not just about books:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can borrow books, movies, even video games!</li>
<li>I can use our city libraries without having to leave the house. How?
<ul>
<li>The Kitchener library system lets you download unlimited e-books, magazines to keep, two songs to keep twice a month, and lets you stream movies (twice a month)</li>
<li>You can search online for an item (from both cities) and place a hold on it to be delivered to your preferred library for pick-up (but you need to return the item to a library of the city it belongs)</li>
<li>They email you when your item is ready to be picked up and when upcoming items are due back</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The beauty of our libraries is that you can get both a Kitchener and a Waterloo library card</li>
<li>Aside from parking and fines, all their services are free!</li>
<li>Programs, films, talks, including family-friendly activities</li>
<li>Media space and use of a 3D printer (limited to 3hrs a day)</li>
</ul>
<p>&#8212;<br />
Well, I hope you enjoyed this series. Maybe you&#8217;ll consider taking up this challenge sometime or check out some of these places too if you haven&#8217;t already?<br />

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				One of the great things about living in Kitchener-Waterloo is that you don&#8217;t need to go far to eat, shop, or play. Perhaps it is partly because of this that one of friends can say that Waterloo isn&#8217;t about the scenery or the pretty buildings, but about the community that brings the people and the city together (I&#8217;m glad that others have come to <a title="Talent Attraction Lab" href="http://her.happyhippos.ca/2011/11/talent-attraction-lab/">this same conclusion</a>).<br />
Yesterday, the little one and I deviated from her regular routine and instead of a morning nap; we headed over to our neighbourhood community centre to play with toys and make new friends.&nbsp; Today, I participated in a free, lively workshop (hosted by Employment Ontario) about money saving ideas in and around town and was inspired by other like-minded people who have even better methods of saving money / finding a good deal (so I&#8217;m not the only crazy one out there <a href="http://bec4-beyondthepicketfence.blogspot.ca/2012/05/pallet-bench-tutorial.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">who wants to turn a palette into a furniture piece!</a> sadly, I don&#8217;t have any tools nor have I the woodworking experience).<br />
In this morning&#8217;s daily #livelocalkw email, we were asked, <em>how do you feel about your community when you eat, shop, and play local?</em>&nbsp; Aside from being able to support the livelihood of those in the community, by being intentional, the faces around you eventually become people you know instead of strangers who you may only interact with once or twice (or maybe not&nbsp; at all for those transactions done over a screen).<br />
Today&#8217;s picks:</p>
<h3>Eat</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/aromacafewaterloo/photos/a.215748145251734.1073741828.174792352680647/284505125042702/?type=1&amp;theater"></a> Aroma Cafe&#8217;s Bibimbap (Photo: Aroma Cafe, Facebook)<br />
Uptown Waterloo&#8217;s <a href="https://www.facebook.com/aromacafewaterloo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Aroma Café</a>, <em>not</em> to be confused with the Toronto-based Aroma Espresso Bar franchise chain, is a small coffee shop that is tucked away in the upstairs of the building beside Angie&#8217;s Kitchen. But don&#8217;t think that it&#8217;s just another &#8220;coffee&#8221; shop; Kiki, the owner, is super-friendly and aside from making their own blends of coffee beans (which they discount off every few days to keep their supply fresh), I love that she puts her own twist in traditional Korean bibimbap, using atypical ingredients like beets, turnip, avocado, and alfalfa sprouts so that the dish tastes super fresh and is full of &#8220;gourmet&#8221; vegetables. I&#8217;ve concluded that any of her Korean-style takes are simply delicious, because her rice cakes and kalbi pockets were tasty too.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Shop</h3>
<p>One of our regular weekly destinations to shop on Saturdays is the Kitchener Market. We go to get locally grown vegetables, eggs, and other good (non-local) deals. We also find that the average price at this market cheaper than the one in St. Jacob&#8217;s, perhaps it is because it feels less touristy and has fewer vendors. Like the St. Jacob&#8217;s market, many vendors will also mark down their fresh food to clear their stock by the end of the day (10 minutes prior closing, which is around 2pm).</p>
<h3>Play</h3>
<p>Community associations/centres and recreation complexes provide quality programs at affordable prices; for instance, the caregiver + tot drop-in down the street from us costs $1 each time we go.&nbsp; Depending on the community association, you can find a range of offerings, from fitness and sports like <a href="http://www.kitchener.ca/en/livinginkitchener/Lyle_Hallman_Walking_Track.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">indoor running tracks</a> (free!), badminton and ballroom dancing to art and cooking classes. Our neighbourhood association even throws a yearly party for the community, bringing live entertainment, music, and bouncy castles!<br />
Even if you&#8217;re not participating this challenge, how do <em>you</em> feel when you eat, shop, or play local?		</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				We&#8217;ll be donating a few toonies by the end of the week (e.g. caught myself snacking on a Cliff Mojo Dark Chocolate bar from Costco &#8211; which are 1/2 the price of retail btw!), but in our quest to find local food today, we ended up touching on the topic of how far is considered local? I think we&#8217;ve concluded that not enough is locally grown (whether of feasibility because of climate or other reasons). For instance, we drove to Herrles Market, a local farm known for its corn and strawberries among other product, but it is in Wilmot. And how about fruit? Even though we&#8217;re ordering from local co-ops, their fruit is tree-run from the Niagara region. Or avocados. Or vineyard wine.<br />
Today&#8217;s local find? Free mulch (chips) and dirt at the local dump (Waterloo Region Waste Management: Gate 2, open until 4pm on weekdays). We took a recycling bin&#8217;s worth and our garden has a nice new layer of mulch now (saving $ from having to buy non-local from a hardware store or gardening centre).<br />
By featuring a few of my favourite spots this week, perhaps you&#8217;ll end up calling them yours too if you&#8217;re in this area. What are some of your favourites?<br />
Today&#8217;s picks:</p>
<h3>Eat</h3>
<p><figure style="width: 320px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/aimeili/sets/72157626912574894/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5310/5810465205_30732de305_n.jpg" alt="" height="200" width="320"/></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Uptown21</figcaption></figure><br />
Uptown21, or the long-form <a href="http://uptown21.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nat and Nick&#8217;s Uptown 21</a> for their <a title="Uptown21: Tapas Tuesdays" href="http://her.happyhippos.ca/2011/06/uptown21-tapas-tuesdays/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tapas Tuesdays</a> and #brownbagfridays.&nbsp; This restaurant features in-season ingredients that are sourced locally, and the couple that runs it came from Hannah&#8217;s Bella Bistro (don&#8217;t recall the food, but vaguely recall a &#8220;date&#8221; there!); the people there have influenced other successful ventures (e.g. West of Seoul food truck, MPC Public / MamaPapa Catering Co., TacoFarm)<br />
If you&#8217;re an adventurous eater, they determine what they serve on those days (so you can&#8217;t choose). Make a reservation at Uptown21 for their AYCE tapas &#8211; for $35 they&nbsp; keep the tapas coming until you say stop. And don&#8217;t forget about the dessert tapas too!<br />
For #brownbagfridays, it&#8217;s local, made in-house, and a great deal at $5 tax in (take-out only). The line up starts before noon, even though they only serve from noon until they run out. Keep an eye out on <a href="https://twitter.com/nnuptown21" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">their twitter account</a> for their weekly feature, especially for their fried chicken sandwiches &#8211; they are amazing! Oh, and don&#8217;t forget to bring a mug for their (iced) tea of the day, which is also included in the $5 price.</p>
<h3>Shop</h3>
<p>Most of our friends knows that we have a good collection of board games. Most of it comes from <a href="http://www.jjcards.com/shop/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">J&amp;J Superstore</a> (we know it as J&amp;J&#8217;s, and they sell great toys too! and yes, MTG cards to those so inclined). We find their prices quite reasonable as well (though others have told me that <a href="http://www.greatboardgames.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">German Boardgames</a>, a local business that used to be run from some guy&#8217;s basement, has better pricing especially when you buy a lot of games in a year).<br />
(So why pay $5 to play at board game cafés &#8211; which have popped up recently around here, when you can play our place &#8211; how about instead of us charging you $5, you just bring us some food? Though you could borrow some as well).</p>
<h3>Play</h3>
<p>Speaking of local dumps, <a href="http://www.kitchener.ca/en/livinginkitchener/MclennanPark.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">McLennan Park</a> is a family favourite, especially in the winter. This was the old local dump that has converted into a park, which is (not-so-)affectionly known as Mount Trashmore. It&#8217;s conveniently close to us and features a great splash pad, dirt / mountain bike challenges (haven&#8217;t tried), and in the winter, Mount Trashmore itself is a great hill for toboganning adventures, but beware of the steep and long runs &#8211; we&#8217;ve seen paramedics called to the scene at the bottom of the hill.<br />
&lt;warning: choppy video below &#8211; not for those who get motion sick watching choppy videos&gt;<br />
<iframe title="Tobogganing at Mount Trashmore" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/v8KdxNyAl4g?start=17&#038;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe><br />
&#8212;<br />
Speaking of adventures, we haven&#8217;t been to the newest in-person game fad that I remember as a 2D computer game &#8211;&nbsp; Adventure Room, where you need to solve puzzles to get out of a locked room!<br />
&nbsp;		</p>

				<description><![CDATA[We&#8217;re taking part of #livelocalkw, a challenge to eat, shop, and play locally for one week. I hesitated on signing up to take on the challenge, as I knew that it wasn&#8217;t going to be easy and I didn&#8217;t want to be held accountable. Sure, our family shops at the market weekly, tend to choose locally-based restaurants when eating out, and stay in the area for most activities, but we don&#8217;t make a conscious effort to restrict our choices to being local only.

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				We&#8217;re taking part of <a href="http://livelocalkw.wordpress.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#livelocalkw</a>, a challenge to eat, shop, and play locally for one week. I hesitated on signing up to take on the challenge, as I knew that it wasn&#8217;t going to be easy and I didn&#8217;t want to be held accountable. Sure, our family shops at the market weekly, tend to choose locally-based restaurants when eating out, and stay in the area for most activities, but we don&#8217;t make a conscious effort to restrict our choices to being local only. With groceries, we tend to focus on prices and convenience, which when &#8216;local&#8217; isn&#8217;t always the cheapest or in season. But the <a href="http://www.baileyslocalfoods.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$20 membership to Baileys Local</a> for <a href="http://livelocalkw.wordpress.com/participating-people/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#livelocalkw participants</a> was the motivating incentive to push us forward, so we&#8217;ve signed up and have had lively discussions with each other on <a href="http://livelocalkw.wordpress.com/2014/08/18/what-does-local-mean-to-you/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">what is considered &#8216;local</a>&#8216;, with questions from whether social networking and blogging need to be on a hiatus, to whether our house is truly local because of the materials that were used to build it, but I think we&#8217;ve settled on being local-minded as much as possible, so for me, no online shopping on Amazon or streaming non-locally based YouTube or Netflix videos for example, but we can still take part in conversations online with folks around town and to share about our progress. And <a href="http://livelocalkw.wordpress.com/faq/#people" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">if we cheat, we&#8217;ll give $2 towards Foodlink Waterloo Region</a><br />
So this week, I&#8217;ll feature some places that I enjoy going to eat, shop, and play (even though they may not be a <a href="http://livelocalkw.wordpress.com/participating-businesses/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">participating business</a> for the challenge). Will you consider joining us this week as well? <a href="http://livelocalkw.wordpress.com/participating-people/#signup" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">It&#8217;s not too late to sign up!</a><br />
Here are the first three:</p>

We&#8217;ve had delicious home-cooked meals with local lamb chops, lamb meatballs, and spiced chicken with local swiss chard, kale, bacon, butternut squash and beans as sides thus far, but when it comes to eating out, one of my favourite coffee shops around is<a href="http://www.dvlb.ca" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> DVLB (short for Death Valley&#8217;s Little Brother)</a> &#8211; they make some fantastic coffee (including espresso-based drinks and even hot chocolate, and for those who have only been drinking Starbucks/McDonald&#8217;s/etc., don&#8217;t expect them to be syruped or necessarily big in size), and their desserts and pastries are great complements. I also really like the atmosphere as well, with repurposed wooden tables and cycled artwork on the walls.</p>
<h3>Shop</h3>
<p><a href="http://advguide.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Adventure Guide </a>is my go-to for quality outdoor gear. The team at Adventure Guide knows their stuff, and most of the time, they are happy to help you and answer any questions you have, even if it&#8217;s not related to their products (like, how do you keep an infant warm when camping?). They also rent out some great equipment for reasonable prices as well.<br />
Twice a year, they wake up early and put on a fantastic sale for members. Sadly, one can only get so many shoes ($40) and jackets (70% off) before you have too many and need to stop buying the great deals &#8211; because they are quality products, they don&#8217;t typically wear out that fast either! Clothing and other miscellaneous items are often bundled into the sale as well. And the best part is that membership is only $10 for a lifetime and you get points from all purchases (even from the sales) that you can eventually use to redeem on future purchases.</p>

<p> Turtle in the sun at Huron Natural Area (Photo: Emily L)<br />
Maintained by the City of Kitchener, <a href="http://www.kitchener.ca/en/livinginkitchener/HuronNaturalArea.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Huron Natural Area</a>, is an urban trail park that is conveniently close to us. Seems like the trails are accessible throughout the year (even with a stroller), whether in snow, rain or sun. I especially enjoy watching the turtles bask in the sun, but we&#8217;ve also seen and heard many frogs there too!<br />

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In my last post, I went on and on about AYCE sushi places, so maybe it&#8217;s time to highlight other &#8220;Japanese&#8221; restaurants.</p>
<p>Enter Tomoya, a relatively new and hidden gem (at least for Korean food).</p>
<p><strong>Tomoya: Japanese Bistro &amp; Bar</strong><span class="adr"><span class="street-address"><br />325 Max Becker Drive<br /></span><span class="locality">Kitchener</span>, <span class="region">ON<br /></span><span class="phone tel">(519) 749-9997</span></span></p>
<p><span class="adr"><span class="phone tel">Date of last visit: July 9, 2011 (for dinner)<br /></span></span></p>
<p><span class="adr">It seems that the name &#8216;Tomoya&#8217; is really a compound of two Japanese words: Ya &#8211; for store or shop, and Tomo &#8211; meaning friend.<br /></span></p>
<p><span class="adr">But, I don&#8217;t go to Tomoya for their Japanese food, though I do enjoy their spicy salmon sushi rolls ($5.95); I come for their Korean food.</span></p>
<p><span class="adr"><br /></span></p>
<p><span class="adr">Like many non-AYCE &#8220;Japanese&#8221; restaurants in town, Tomoya is managed by Koreans, which is fine, because I have come to like Korean food a lot since coming back from a short visit to Korea many years ago (sadly, many Korean dishes often rely on generous amounts of garlic and onions, to which I sometimes suffer consequences from because of a mild food intolerance I have).<br /></span></p>
<p>Many would probably say that the prices at Tomoya are a bit high, but I would compare it to the prices of Taka (Bleams+Strasburg). I am willing to pay $10 for their <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bibimbap" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">stone bowl (dolsot) bibibamp</a>, as I would say it&#8217;s equally good and similarly priced as Korean BBQ Restaurant in downtown, and much closer than downtown is for us.</p>
</p>
<p>The portion sizes always surprise me; you really get a pretty big serving of the Korean dishes (haven&#8217;t tried the Japanese, but the table next to us was raving about the chicken teriyaki and the Korean galbi/beef ribs). Furthermore, they seem to always give us miso soup and salad to start the meal, and some seasonal fruit to finish (pretty much regardless of what we order &#8211; watermelon this time, last time it was apples) &#8211; and this time even some kimchi to go with our Korean dishes (as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banchan" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">banchan</a>?)! They have limited selection of Korean dishes, but what they have is consistent, and tasty.</p>
<p>It appears that they have some lunch and monthly specials. I had my eye on the soon tofu stew ($8.50) but an <span id="result_box" class="short_text" lang="ko"><span class="hps" title="Click for alternate translations">&#50500;&#45768;&#50724;</span></span>&#65279; from the kitchen confirmed that they only serve it during lunch hour. Instead, I opted for the monthly special, which was described as crystal noodles, but I know it as &#8220;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japchae" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">japchae</a>&#8221; ($4.50). Because it was on the appetizer section of the menu (regularly $5.50), I didn&#8217;t actually expect much (in terms of portion size), so I ordered a roll to go with it. Was I ever wrong &#8211; the portion size is much bigger than expected, and would be perfect for someone with a lighter appetite, like myself!</p>
</p>
<p><span class="adr">It&#8217;s kind of sad to see them relatively empty every time we go, but I guess it is pretty much off the beaten path. It&#8217;s also somewhat unsettling to hear the microwave after you place your order (to defrost the meat??). The service is somewhat sparse, and maybe it&#8217;s a language barrier &#8211; but with so few customers, I can understand that they only really need one person to look after the tables.</span>&#65279;</p>
<p>I hope they&#8217;ll last and stick around, because it gives me one other option for non-AYCE sushi and Korean food! By the time I&#8217;m full, I&#8217;ve paid less than a meal at an AYCE place anyway.</p>
<p>And here&#8217;s a link to the only other blog review I managed to stumble upon on Google: Tomoya Japanese Bistro &amp; Bar</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>June 2011 Update:</strong></p>
<p>Since the series of posts about a few sushi restaurants in town a few years ago, more and more all-you-can-eat (ayce) sushi options have been popping around the region &#8211; it&#8217;s almost to the point of oversaturation. Most of them have a dollar or two difference in weekday vs. weekend pricing.</p>
<p>Here are some of the choices:<strong></strong><strong></strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Sushi Feast</strong>, Cambridge, ON &#8211; good tight rolls, small pieces that aren&#8217;t filled with rice. Points for presentation: sashimi and rolls are sometimes served in a sushi boat even. Probably is my first choice for fish and rolls. More expensive than most.</li>
<li><strong></strong><strong>&#65279;</strong><strong>Nara Sushi</strong>, Kitchener, ON &#8211; closer to us, decent overall, favourite is Nara Roll, which is made from rice paper instead of seaweed. Offers more unique cooked items like salmon belly. Beef ribs quite tender as well. My first choice for cooked items.<strong>&#65279; </strong>It&#8217;s a nice bonus that carbonated drinks are included in the price, and that kids under 5 eat free. In terms of pricing, Sunday is considered a weekday.<strong><br /></strong></li>
<li><strong>Sushi Boat</strong>, Kitchener, ON &#8211; close to Nara Sushi in terms of location, and a good alternative (non-similar options for their menu items, such as rolls with mango and kiwi). While some may say the menu offering is a bit smaller than others, the salmon sashimi has good texture, and even offers red tuna sashimi (though I didn&#8217;t much like the texture nor taste of it there).&nbsp; The soups aren&#8217;t as salty as most places, but all the salads are lettuce based (instead of the pure seaweed for example). This one, unlike all of the others mentioned in this post has employees that also speak Cantonese, instead of just Mandarin or Korean. Has a VIP room for bigger groups. In terms of pricing, Sunday is considered a weekday.&#65279; Children under 5 also eat free.<br /><strong>Update</strong>: a visit two months later resulted in very poor quality rolls, mainly due to warm rice. The sashimi is still pretty decent though.<br /><strong></strong></li>
<li><strong>Sakaye</strong>, Cambridge, ON &#8211; would not go for their rolls, but their Korean dishes are delicious. Their deep-fried items like tempura or potato croquette use the same batter. Sashimi (dinner) is hit and miss: salmon is good, tuna is somewhat mushy.</li>
<li><strong>Sushi 99</strong>, Waterloo, ON &#8211;<span style="text-decoration: line-through;"> I must admit, I have not tried their all-you-can-eat yet, but</span>Sushi 99&#8217;s AYCE is nothing to write home about, despite their extra choices for deep fried vanilla ice cream and cold creme brulee: the rolls have rice that is still warm, their kitchen dishes are okay (seafood pancake, green onion roll), but Nara Sushi seems to have better quality (kalbi/short ribs there are less fatty, and their salmon belly is less deep fried). Their a la carte option is good value and decent taste. e.g. Spicy salmon with avocado 8 piece roll $4.95, Chicken teriyaki meal ($9?) offers a good portion of meat with stir-fried vegetables on rice</li>
<li>As for <strong>Ye&#8217;s</strong>, Waterloo/Kitchener, and <strong>Sushi Star(s)</strong>, Kitchener, ON &#8211; used to go a lot more when it first opened, but now it doesn&#8217;t really stand out compared with the other choices. And I haven&#8217;t been to Ye&#8217;s Sportsworld Kitchener, Yummyaki (Korean-operated) in Waterloo, since it renovated, or Yummy&#8217;s (Waterloo, ON)</li>
</ol>
<p>We generally do not go to AYCE places for quality, just like we don&#8217;t generally go to chain restaurants for theirs either; it&#8217;s more for convenience (variety in a group setting that&#8217;s almost the same price as ordering an entree at a sit-down restaurant).&#65279;</p>
<p>So with that being said, the a la carte sushi rolls at <strong>Casa Mia</strong>, Waterloo, ON is probably one of the best in quality/taste around here!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.uptown21.ca" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Uptown21</strong></a><br />21 King Street South<br /> Waterloo, ON<br /> 519.883.1100<br />Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/NNUptown21" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@NNUptown21</a><br />Date of visit: June 7, 2011</p>
<p>After stumbling upon the book <em>Where to Eat in Canada</em> in Newfoundland some years ago, we have bought a copy of a later edition and discovered some places to try locally. Over the years, we have visited some on special occasions and this year, it just so happened that Tapas Tuesdays at Nick &amp; Nat&#8217;s Uptown21 coincided with my birthday! So, we took the opportunity to try it.ï»¿</p>
<p>A friend asked me whether it was worth it, so here are my thoughts:</p>
<p>Serving time is from 5 to 9pm. We had a reservation at 5:30 pm and stayed pretty much until almost 8:30 pm. They&#8217;re really quick to bring you food until the tables start getting full (which by the way, seems to be always a full house so reservations a pretty much necessary on Tuesdays). Then, the food slows down, but it let&#8217;s you have time to digest and just enjoy, so not for those in a rush. We started to refer to each round of tapas as &#8220;levels&#8221; (like in a video game, the geeks that we are) since the breaks got longer in between (and fewer dishes) and we wanted to see how many we could try before we were full; the lamb and smoked pork poutine did it.</p>
<p><a title="IMG_9068 by b.p., on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aimeili/5811047294/"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3643/5811047294_c37dfa56b6_m.jpg" alt="IMG_9068" width="200" height="133" /></a> <a title="IMG_9058 by b.p., on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aimeili/5810475225/"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5111/5810475225_1ea7beb562_m.jpg" alt="IMG_9058" width="200" height="133" /></a></p>
<p>If you&#8217;re willing to dish out $35 (+tax, tip) for say another meal (like Summerlicious), then this is worth it. This type of eating suits the types of people who like trying new foods, and not for the types that aren&#8217;t as adventurous and need to know what they&#8217;re ordering, because you won&#8217;t get that there; the dishes change weekly, depending on what they have on hand. It&#8217;s more a meal <em>experience</em> instead of a quick sit-down meal.</p>
<p>At first, I had thought that maybe if more people went, you would get to try more dishes, but it doesn&#8217;t work like AYCE sushi; the portions pretty accurately reflect how many people are the table (which is nice since the portion sizes at sushi are usually the same regardless of the number of people). </p>
<p>So if you do go, I&#8217;d recommend going as early as you can to minimize the wait time between &#8220;levels&#8221;/rounds of food.</p>
<p><a title="IMG_9052 by b.p., on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aimeili/5811035912/"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5200/5811035912_f382d32eda_m.jpg" alt="IMG_9052" width="200" height="133" /></a> <a title="IMG_9098 by b.p., on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aimeili/5810488959/"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5264/5810488959_6a4a42bfda_m.jpg" alt="IMG_9098" width="200" height="133" /></a></p>
<p>And as for me, I would go back and try it again &#8211; maybe for another special occasion.</p>
