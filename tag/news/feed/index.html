Two members of our family share a birthday with celebrities: Prince George and Max Zuckerberg. While we&nbsp;had a <a href="http://www.therecord.com/news-story/3904661-couple-s-little-princess-arrives-same-day-as-prince/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">unexpected birth announcement</a>&nbsp;in our local paper with Bean, this babe&nbsp;didn&#8217;t&nbsp;share the same announcement with Facebook&#8217;s $45&nbsp;billion philanthropic birth announcement.<br />
A few weeks earlier, I had posted <a href="http://her.happyhippos.ca/2015/11/one-month-countdown/">a poll on this blog</a> and to select groups on my Facebook feed to see what guesses for our babe&#8217;s gender and delivery date would be this time around, and based on the responses, the majority of participants guessed that the baby would be a boy, and the most common guess for day was December 2 (not sure if it&#8217;s because I told many people my guess &#8211; I figured if I was in early labour starting December 1, I would deliver by December 2). The signs this time around pointed to the baby being a boy, which included buying boy-tagged clothing, receiving gifts that have a slight color-bias to a boy, and only having a name picked out for a boy (the opposite happened with Bean) so perhaps subconsciously I knew. My mother and my sister-in-law won for guessing the right date and gender, with my mother being closest in time (though, I tell her that her guess doesn&#8217;t count because I was already talking about early labour symptoms in our family chat when she submitted her guess).<br />

<h3>Birth Story</h3>
<p>Like many birth stories, some people &#8211; especially those who are not yet&nbsp;parents or health professionals &#8211; may find that the following content may be too graphic / contain too much information. Reader discretion advised.<br />
I&#8217;ve found out that despite similar pregnancy symptoms, you can&#8217;t count on having similar labour and birth stories between babies even within the same family! With Bean, from first contractions to delivery, it was short and relatively&nbsp;pain-free: it lasted 24 hours; but with this one, it felt long, painful, and drawn out, with mild contractions and rectal pressure starting on the Thursday and baby delivered&nbsp;by&nbsp;Tuesday. One redeeming factor, however:&nbsp;active labour &#8211; from when I was first directed to push &#8211; lasted only 17 minutes, as opposed to 4-6 hours. If I was asked which I would prefer, I think in hindsight, this one was probably the better choice, but in the moment, I would have probably told you that I would have preferred one that didn&#8217;t feel so painful.<br />
Since we almost had an accidental home birth with Bean the first time around, and it wasn&#8217;t a bad start, I considered trying at home when presented with the option this time for a few reasons: I wanted to prove (especially to both our mothers) that it was a safe alternative to a hospital birth; being at home cooler months meant that there is no need to shuttle mom+baby in the cold, in construction, and having to find/pay for parking; and we both liked the midwife who didn&#8217;t yet have local hospital privileges but could do home births. It&#8217;s a good thing too, because we would&#8217;ve likely been in and out of the hospital in under 3 hours.<br />
I knew that&nbsp;D-day (doomsday and/or delivery day) was coming closer and closer when I kept having multiple bladder accidents, especially en route to the bathroom after not moving for a while (eg. waking up in the middle of the night). When mild contractions and mild urges for a bowel movement came on the Thursday evening while I was out volunteering at the Operation Christmas Child processing centre, I texted j.w&nbsp;to get things packed and ready to go. The mild contractions seem to have subsided by Sunday, but by Monday, I started to see some pink bloody mucous discharge&nbsp;and felt some&nbsp;mild menstrual-like&nbsp;cramping pains in the morning, intensifying with back pain and rectal pressure with each cramp. That evening, my contractions were more regular, with it peaking at 6-1-1 (six minutes apart for 1 minute for 1 hour), so I was starting to think that I would have the baby in the middle of the night, especially since my sleep was constantly being interrupted starting at 3 AM. I tried to time them using my Fitbit so that I could get some visual data later, but turns out, none of the tracking was recorded and later on, when I was chatting with support, they told me I had found a system bug! (boo)<br />
Of course, as a second-time father, &nbsp;j.w didn&#8217;t seem to give much thought to them or show any&nbsp;urgency, for even on Tuesday morning when I asked if he could work from home for the day, he proceeded to go to a work conference. Later that day, when I tried to ask him to come home because I was going to page the midwife to come, the impression I got was that free lunch trumped coming home earlier, although he did offer to pick something up for me I suppose.<br />
The first time I paged the midwife on the recommendation of the office administrator&nbsp;at the clinic, I asked if Tylenol+gravol was safe to take during the day for pain management (yes, every 4 hours). When she heard that I was experiencing contractions, she offered to come for a home visit early evening and cancel my appointment in the afternoon. A couple of hours later, I called again asking if she could come any earlier as my contractions felt more intense &#8211; thankfully, she did because after an initial assessment, it turns out she already felt the baby&#8217;s head and I was 8 cm dilated. This was when she said I better call j.w to tell him to come home immediately &#8211; thankfully he was already en route. Although our primary midwife (Beau) has only been practicing post-graduation since August of this year (which had my mother-in-law concerned about her experience), she diplomatically told her that we were going to try for a home birth first when my mother-in-law asked about going to the hospital (even though MIL knew that we decided to do that already). It&#8217;s a good thing that my mother-in-law didn&#8217;t overhear the midwives (jokingly?) say that Beau haven&#8217;t ruptured membranes before, but she managed to break the water and with a &#8216;pop&#8217;, the fluid gushed out &#8211; this time on a sheet since it was planned so it didn&#8217;t soak the carpet. Good thing our TENS machine still worked as the midwife&#8217;s was out on loan &#8211; it took the edge off each contraction. I later asked if I would have ever gotten to 10 cm without membrane intervention or to 5-1-1, she did say that some people just never get to 5-1-1. I also later found out that even if I had asked for the laughing gas, I would&#8217;ve been too far along to have been able to use it.<br />
She called the backup midwife + student midwife and after some walking up and down the stairs&nbsp;to get things moving along, they ended up recommending that I do lunges on the stairs, which were tremendously difficult to get through. Of course, the contractions started to slow down once I stopped moving, but after swallowing some labour tincture, and sending j.w to fetch the electric&nbsp;breast pump&nbsp;in hopes that will trigger the uterus to get more contractions going, the midwives somehow&nbsp;managed to coax a few contractions out without it and directed me to push the baby out in those weak contractions (instead of waiting for the natural urge to push &#8211; and it seemed that I pushed even after the contraction was over). Beau&#8217;s advice helped tremendously, but I&#8217;m still not sure why to this day: tuck in chin, hold breath, and push into the pain. The worst part was between contractions, waiting for them especially since it felt like there was a baby stuck waiting for the next push.&nbsp;I later remembered that we had this problem with Bean: my contractions were always short and didn&#8217;t seem to last enough for a big push.&nbsp;<br />
Was there a ring of fire this time? I&#8217;m not sure; I was already moaning through gritted teeth and tears (so maybe that&#8217;s why my jaw was sore&nbsp;a day or so after!). Within 17 minutes (and 3 hours since the midwife first came), the baby was out! This one was 1 lb heavier than Bean &#8211; which also proved that my body CAN push a baby out that was larger than Bean (last OB said that if Bean was any larger, she would&#8217;ve needed a C-section). After declining to touch babe as it was emerging because of the slime and goop, I first saw babe&#8217;s face and then they unwrapped the towel and showed me that it was a boy! j.w missed it so instead of telling him, I just let him see himself. This time, he also had the honours of cutting the umbilical cord&nbsp;after some babe to mom skin-to-skin time (delayed cord clamping).<br />
I don&#8217;t remember noticing the birth of the placenta last time, though I know it came out, but this time though quick, it wasn&#8217;t without some pain. I think it was sped up with a shot of oxytocin. The midwives also stitched me up (black dissolvable thread with local anesthesia) as I had a natural second-degree tear and I appreciated that they calmly tried to stop the moderate amount of bleeding that is post-partum hemorrhage (apparently I lost more blood than necessary &#8211; and they check by pressing on your uterus / belly to see if it&#8217;s firmed up and if any blood gushes out) &#8211; with the help of some dissolvable tablet under the tongue and an IV drip (of oxytocin?); each of the&nbsp;midwives have enough supplies for a &#8220;mini Cambridge hospital&#8221; in their car, so they can attend to little emergencies like this. &nbsp;A catheter was uncomfortably put in but taken out pretty much right away after emptying my bladder, unlike at the hospital which stayed in for the duration of the delivery. &nbsp;A few times, I wanted to doze off, but they didn&#8217;t let me because of the amount of blood that I lost. Not too long after, my body had the shakes and chills, which was accompanied by a fever so the midwife stuck around for a bit longer &#8211; thankfully it dissipated by morning, which meant it wasn&#8217;t a sign of an infection (or a piece of placenta left inside). &nbsp;Apparently the midwife doesn&#8217;t leave until you can tell them that you can pee (and apparently mothers tend to find it easiest to do a first pee in the shower).<br />
In the end, the basement worked out to be a great place to do everything: I got a chance to nap in peace on a double bed as j.w took shifts with the baby, the lights were dimmable and at its brightest setting, brighter than our bedroom and the bathroom was just steps away; it was also more spacious and laminate floors are easier to clean than carpet. The midwives help with some clean-up: they bagged the placenta, garbage in another, and laundry in a garbage bag; I &nbsp;that all blood stains came out in the wash completely! &nbsp;<br />
My body down there seems to have recovered quicker than the first, but there seem to be more muscle aches and pains, with the pecs being the worst so I can no longer lift Bean (not sure if it was from poor posture breastfeeding or as Beau puts it, your body has gone through a marathon). I&#8217;ve already lost 10 lbs the first day (of the 20lb I gained) so we&#8217;ll see if it&#8217;ll bounce back to shape quickly.</p>
<h3>First Days</h3>
<p>The first days have been challenging, with him sleeping nicely during the day, but not wanting to sleep on his own at night. This isn&#8217;t new to us, as Bean had her night and day switched as well. Milk supply hasn&#8217;t been too bad either, with him losing 10% on day 3, but gaining again by day 6. This time, I have started using a <a href="https://www.motherlove.com/product/more-milk-plus-alcohol-free" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">herbal tincture by motherlove </a>on the recommendation of my midwife. I just found out that the herbs are only effective for the few 2ish weeks so I better start&nbsp;taking it more regularly.<br />
I should have been prepared that he would be the one to spit up though, since Bean has ever only spit up/thrown up twice in her lifespan. &nbsp;Maybe because there was some tiny milk supply left in me to begin with that he actually had more than the recommendation soiled diapers for the first couple of days (the number of day should match the number of soiled diapers).<br />
Bean seems to take to baby brother well for the most part (eg. wants to hold him, say goodbye to him, ask what about what he is doing), but I think there are difficult moments for her &#8211; as it is for me &#8211;&nbsp;as she sometimes breaks down or have out bursts over things that she normally wouldn&#8217;t. I miss spending time with her, and while I know she misses certain things that I do with her, she seems to find solace in others right now (or looks to others instead of to me), which is good but I feel a mother&#8217;s guilt and a bit sad too that I can&#8217;t be there for her for things that she used to ask mama to do with her.		</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				<img class="alignright wp-image-4610 size-medium" src="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/1-WP_20150722_14_07_39_Pro-252x300.jpg" alt="Sonograph" height="300" width="252" srcset="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/1-WP_20150722_14_07_39_Pro-252x300.jpg 252w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/1-WP_20150722_14_07_39_Pro-768x916.jpg 768w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/1-WP_20150722_14_07_39_Pro.jpg 859w" sizes="(max-width: 252px) 100vw, 252px" /><br />
Gasp, can&#8217;t believe we&#8217;re already at the halfway mark! Bean has been such a distraction that I haven&#8217;t counted, Daddy isn&#8217;t as involved this time around at coming to midwife sessions and other appointments, and we&#8217;re just going with the flow (seems like typical second child syndrome!).<br />
This time, I had an inkling based on the sudden minor weight changes when I was tracking for my fitbit but I had continued to drink a few gulps of beer here and there because I just dismissed that gnawing feeling (guilty!). So, j.w finally went to the dollar store to buy a test to confirm (wow, a huge savings than buying from the pharmacy!). Compared to the last, the symptoms have been pretty consistent, with the exception that my feet feel like it&#8217;s pulsing (swollen?) all the time and everything is happening so much sooner:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nausea</li>
<li>Food stuck in gums near the teeth</li>
<li>Fatigue</li>
<li>Round ligament and groin pain (much sooner than first time but surprisingly, chiro visits seem to help!)</li>
<li>Abdominal pulling when lifting heavy things</li>
<li>Baby bump showing at 3 months instead of later (4-5?)</li>
</ul>
<p>Bean must know something is up (though a fried says it&#8217;s a phase even when you&#8217;re not expecting) because despite Daddy complaining the she wanted him all the time after our trip, that soon passed and now mommy is super-priority. If she&#8217;s around, she&#8217;s the one that&#8217;s Bean-appointed to buckle her in, sit beside her, hold her, play with her, change diapers, feed her (or assist), change clothes, do the bedtime routine., etc. Thankfully, she knows that Daddy is the one that takes her outside to play in the evenings.<br />
At first, I had wanted to find out about the gender for practical and prep reasons, but last night I changed my mind &#8211; because how am I going to keep it a secret from my husband and everyone else for another 20 weeks? The mystery is what makes it a fun surprise for everyone too. The ultrasound technician today was really patient, took many images for us to take home, and showed us a lot of detail, unlike the sonographer (at a lab well known for&nbsp; pregnancy ultrasounds) <a href="http://her.happyhippos.ca/2013/04/hiding-no-more/">who said it wasn&#8217;t for &#8220;entertainment purposes&#8221;</a>: the heart pulsing (amazing!), spine, hands, feet, eyes (the lens!)&#8230;she even said that sometimes you can see the baby pee if she ventures down there (and they just drink it all back, yum). She also explained to me that they&#8217;re the eyes for the radiologist, who actually provides an analysis and report to the midwife &#8211; and here I thought the technicians did that too! This time, I only drank around 750 ml of water an hour prior, as I couldn&#8217;t hold it for the session last time (didn&#8217;t help the tech was late). Thankfully, last time, in her empathy, she told me I was allowed to go for 7 seconds (HOW does one cut off pee after exactly 7 seconds especially if they have weak pelvic floor muscles?) and said that they didn&#8217;t actually require 1L of water to get good results but it was formally still required (and wondered at how they expected pregnant women told hold so much for so long) so I cheated this time around.<br />
I opted to go with another midwife practice this time around because they have the <a href="http://www.perinatalservicesbc.ca/ForHealthcareProviders/Resources/ConnectingPregnancy.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Connecting Pregnancy</a> group session program, which after attending one session, seems to serve as a good reminder of previous prenatal classes but best of all, it&#8217;s free! For one of the activities in the nutrition session, we were asked to shared what we have heard about eating during pregnancy and then discussed whether they were true or false. Most people were surprised and amused at the Chinese pre-cautions around avoiding watermelon (cooling food) until third trimester due to pre-term labour risk and avoiding spicy food, crustaceans, pineapple and mango (hot foods?) due to potential skin allergies that your future baby will develop.<br />
I have some crafting/sewing projects on the go (and in my mind) that I hope we&#8217;ll have time to finish before baby arrives, but we&#8217;ll see how well that works out and we&#8217;ll see if my nesting instinct kicks in this time around. I certainly don&#8217;t look forward to pre-washing and prepping baby clothes and gear as laundry isn&#8217;t exactly my forté (I tend to forget it in the wash so it doesn&#8217;t get to dry right away).		</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Happy new year! We anticipate 2013 will be a year of surprises, changes, lots of excitement and uncertainty, along with shared joys and support.

If you hadn&#8217;t or haven&#8217;t heard by now, here is the most frequently asked question: When will it be?<br />
Here are the answers to other FAQs, most of which are &#8220;We don&#8217;t know&#8221; but thanks for being excited for us!</p>
<ul>
<li>When and where did this happen?<br />
On the evening of my birthday in Halifax</li>
<li>Did you really say, &#8220;I guess so&#8221;?<br />
I guess?</li>
<li>When is the date?<br />
We don&#8217;t know yet &#8211; possibly Fall 2009</li>
<li>Where will it be?<br />
TBD</li>
<li>How did it happen?<br />

<li>Were you surprised?<br />
I think part of me suspected since I asked some pretty probing questions but the rest of me was in denial.</li>
</ul>
