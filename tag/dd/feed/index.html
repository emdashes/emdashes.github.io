<p class="has-drop-cap">When you ask Little Brother how old he is, he holds up two fingers, and confidently says, &#8220;Three!&#8221; While I find myself correcting him almost every time, mathematically, I suppose he isn&#8217;t incorrect.</p>


<p>At the age he is at now, he&#8217;s starting to identify colours (or colors, for my American friends). He knows &#8220;black&#8221; and &#8220;wipe&#8221; (white), and maybe he knows the others too, but when you ask him what shirt he&#8217;s wearing, or what colour Daddy is wearing today, he might respond with &#8220;Thomas!&#8221;, &#8220;Percy!&#8221;, or &#8220;James!&#8221;. Some days, he might mention Emily or Stephen / Rocket too. It just so happens, those are the colours of  Thomas the train and friends; so, I suppose he isn&#8217;t incorrect.</p>


<p class="has-background has-very-light-gray-background-color">I&#8217;ve come to realize that although Bean doesn&#8217;t often show affection towards people, she deeply cares and loves her little brother. This side of her shows when we are trying to threaten him or put him in time out, she pleas that we don&#8217;t carry through (&#8220;I don&#8217;t want him to go to the hospital&#8221; or &#8220;don&#8217;t leave him!&#8221;) or wants to follow him into time out and be with him. So, in case you missed it &#8211; because I almost did: her favourite colour is no longer green, but currently, &#8220;Thomas&#8221;; I think his is James &#8211; because she has designated the red train in our set for him. He likes trains, so now, she does too.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				That&#8217;s our office cat in the photo. I&#8217;m one month in. And yet, it feels like a lot longer than that. I&#8217;ve found a rhythm that works with this new routine, and I&#8217;m thankful that both our kids have adjusted well too. Consequently, we transitioned our oldest to full day kindergarten, and after some trial and error, we dropped her afternoon nap, we eat dinner earlier, and they go to sleep earlier. Unfortunately, our youngest still wakes up at night and asks for food then, but our oldest seems to fall asleep faster and stays asleep throughout the night for the most part. This week has been one of the few germ-free weeks this year, so it&#8217;s a nice relief to not have to deal with that (if it wasn&#8217;t him, it was her, and if it wasn&#8217;t either of them, it was us or our daycare) &#8211; I&#8217;m grateful that our workplaces are pretty flexible when it comes from work from home policies and taking time off / emergency days, so we pretty took turns staying home with one child or both children. How do working families who don&#8217;t have backup plans / caregivers manage?<br />
At the beginning, it sort of felt like I was starting at a new school in the middle of the school year; I had a lot to learn and a lot of faces and names to remember. I still have a lot to learn and faces and names to remember, but it feels like I&#8217;m making an impact. I&#8217;m also thankful that I enjoy my work, so it&#8217;s easy to wake up earlier and rush out the door.<br />
We will have to find a different routine come summer, but so far, it&#8217;s been working out just perfectly. I&#8217;m glad I scaled back my hours (before signing the offer) because it turns out if you&#8217;re driving a car for school pick-up, you pretty much have to arrive in the neighbourhood at least 20 minutes early in order to find available street parking around the perimeter of the school; otherwise, you&#8217;re pretty much out of luck. And even though I get off at 2:30PM, by the time I get everyone home, it&#8217;s 4PM. I then give them a small snack, work on unloading the dishwasher and getting another load in, and starting supper. By the time we are done dinner, it&#8217;s close to 7PM, and we play a bit then bathe (if applicable), and then off to bed. After that, I clean up the kitchen (pack food away, prep lunches) and maybe wash or fold the laundry. I&#8217;ve been doing laundry on weekends in loads, so I can just sit and binge-watch Netflix (working through The Crown) while folding.<br />
Surprisingly, I find myself dozing off before midnight and using the computer less after work (but still on my phone) &#8211; maybe it&#8217;s because I no longer have mid-day naps or work is more tiring than staying at home (though I feel it&#8217;s a break / nice change from home life). I&#8217;m on a modified work week, and I&#8217;m already wondering how full-time working parents do this every day and survive? I applaud those families!<br />
Other than work and school, we started going to a different small group / life group, which has changed to an earlier start time, which means for the first time in a long time, we actually get to stay past dinner. We have also started going to another church, primarily because Bean is at an age where she is learning, and I simply can&#8217;t go on teaching her every week &#8211; and when I don&#8217;t, I hear implied comments about going to a different church anyway. I&#8217;m a little sad, but since I also miss fellowship time because I&#8217;m watching them after service is over while everyone else is chatting and because people don&#8217;t tend to eat together for lunch as much anymore, I&#8217;m not really connecting with anyone either. I know Bean misses it because on occasion, she tells me she wants to go back to Simply, or that she wants me to be her teacher that day, and every time we pass by St. Paul&#8217;s, she points out that it&#8217;s our church. Finding a new church to call home is hard. Personally, I don&#8217;t like the format of the sermons by the lead pastor at this new church so far (grossly paraphrased: partial verses are taken from different translations to fit into the sermon&#8217;s points) though the supporting pastor actually goes into a passage in contrast, but the kids seem to have adjusted so well even at the first visit and a lot of effort is put into the children&#8217;s spiritual wellbeing and education. So yes, 2018 is going to be a year of change and adjustment.</p>
<hr />
Two years ago, we were celebrating <a href="http://her.happyhippos.ca/2016/02/two-month-milestones/">two month milestones</a>. Now, at 2, he&#8217;s come a long way:</p>
<ul>
<li>Speaks in complete sentences. Has started to communicate (and copy) in English. Boo.</li>
<li>Enjoys climbing and doing crazy things and will deliberately test boundaries with people in authority (me &#8211; he&#8217;s heavy so I can&#8217;t just pick him up and grab him while grocery shopping for example, so I don&#8217;t go when I&#8217;m on my own as it&#8217;s impossible to get more than one or two things in one trip)</li>
<li>Loves to sing, and can sing many songs in English including the Alphabet song, Twinkle Twinkle Little Star, Away in the Manger, Roly Poly and can sing along with or recognize songs by Walk Off the Earth, Moana, and Frozen.</li>
<li>Loves trains, especially Thomas. And cars. And airplanes. Prefers trains though, if given a choice.</li>
<li>Easily sucked in by technology: photos on the phone, TV, iPad game, and YouTube videos. One time early on, the caregiver gave an older child a tablet to use while the younger ones were supposed to nap; he had a meltdown and refused to sleep. Then she figured out why (we had warned her prior so she made the connection and no more problems since).</li>
<li>Has not completely weaned. So, I&#8217;m still off dairy and some nuts. Nuts!</li>
<li>While he started off with liking meat, he doesn&#8217;t seem to like meat (fish the exception) as much anymore, unless it&#8217;s chicken nuggets/fingers/crispy. He will still eat it but when it is in chunks, he tends to pick it out. He also doesn&#8217;t like green fiber veggies, but will repeatedly down it in smoothie form. Like his sister, he loves fruit. Avocados, bananas, and cereal with alternative milk are now his favourite breakfast foods. He is a soup and rice monster. Sometimes noodles too.</li>
<li>Self-toilet training is hit and miss so far &#8211; and if successful, it&#8217;s still only #2 (though a few times, he wakes up with a dry diaper and will go if you put him on the toilet); progress seems to have slowed down or regressed especially now that he doesn&#8217;t tell his caregiver he needs to go (or maybe she hasn&#8217;t learned the signs yet)</li>
<li>He may have had a mini <a href="http://her.happyhippos.ca/2017/04/the-day-we-had-our-first-ambulance-ride/">febrile seizure</a> the other week, when he had a slight fever (while fighting off strange rashes &#8211; maybe mild symptoms of hand, foot, mouth + reaction to lactose in Tylenol) but it lasted no more than a few seconds and it was in his sleep.</li>
<li>He seems interested in people he knows (and babies) &#8211; often willing to share a toy, asking for someone by name, offering hugs to those he loves (except it&#8217;s sad to see hugs not reciprocated, especially when his sister comes out from dance class and he goes to hug her and she brushes him off; however, she always asks to go into timeout with him when he&#8217;s in trouble), and enjoys helping out in the kitchen (putting dishes away, watching and helping mommy cook/bake)</li>
<li>He must have shorter legs or something, because he fits his age in tops when it comes to sizing but his bottoms are behind a bit.</li>
</ul>
<p>I&#8217;m amazed at how fast our children is growing up, now that we all have slightly different routines and that they are no longer babies.		</p>

				<description><![CDATA[In milestones news, I can&#8217;t believe how fast time seems to fly for #2.

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				In milestones news, I can&#8217;t believe how fast time seems to fly for #2. I think partially because he is the second child so it&#8217;s not as lonely, but also because at the back of my mind, I keep thinking&nbsp;that&nbsp;he may be our last baby (and thus, no more &#8220;baby&#8221; moments)!<br />
Now that he&#8217;s moved beyond 12 months, here&#8217;s what we have observed:</p>
<ul>
<li>No distinguable words &#8211; despite the <a href="http://www.ndds.ca/ontario" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NNDS guidelines</a> saying that we should recognize 3 words by 9 months. We don&#8217;t recognize any consistent words, although he has recently be saying &#8220;yeh yeh yeh yeh&#8221; when his paternal grandfather is around, so it might be a correlation. He&#8217;s also copied his sister and said &#8220;Dad-dy&#8221; or &#8220;dada&#8221; and other syllables, but they don&#8217;t seem to be repeated in any sort of associated pattern.</li>
<li>Can freely stand and cruise along furniture, with a walker or while holding your hand &#8211; the first time he did on a walker, he had a blast, laughed for half an hour; crawls like a limping dog</li>
<li>Has taken a few steps, seemingly unintending to &#8211; but like <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+14:29-31" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Peter walking on water</a>, once he realizes he&#8217;s taken a few steps, he stops and falls (or sits down).</li>
<li>Has given up the pacifiers completely</li>
<li>Dropped his morning nap, not by choice</li>
<li>Understands signs or follows your questions, like claps his hands to music though he first wiping his hands instead of clapping, taps his head for head, recognizes and looks up when I say, &#8220;light&#8221;, puts a phone to his ear when I say, &#8220;Hello?&#8221; and mimics mommy. When I say &#8220;mummum&#8221; or put him in the high chair, he immediately clasps his hands in prayer.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Enjoys playing games with you, like foot games and hand games</li>
</ul>
<p>In other news, Bean has self-designated herself as being a &#8220;baby&#8221; more often now, putting toys and teethers into her mouth (which she didn&#8217;t do), asking to be fed and held, crawling around (which she didn&#8217;t do), asked to be called her brother&#8217;s name and saying that the baby is the big sister, and mimicking baby coos.		</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>1:</h2>
<blockquote><p><a href="https://twitter.com/KensingtonRoyal/status/756407093373112320" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Can&#8217;t believe it&#8217;s been three years already!</a>[ref]this is in reference to Prince George but we echo their sentiments[/ref]</p></blockquote>
<p>Though some days, it feels like more. The latest word trend after terrible twos, is not terrifying threes, but threenager. This past year was definitely a year of growth for Bean, both physically and developmentally, expressing herself more verbally, and understanding negotiation tactics, and lately, how to use a firm no. Instead of terrible or tantrum twos (thankfully), I would say teary twos, with more tears&nbsp; as of late and constant[ly the same] questions, accompanied with some whining, as she flip flips from learned independence to craved dependence. She enjoys watching mommy cook and helps out wherever she can: whether it&#8217;s loading the laundry machine, putting dishes away, prepping food for cooking &#8211; I often have to remind myself that although it&#8217;s often faster to do it myself, it&#8217;s these moments that are teaching and practice opportunities, and that I will likely regret it later when she does grow up and decide helping mommy do house chores isn&#8217;t exactly fun.&nbsp; She&#8217;s growing up though: almost toilet-trained (didn&#8217;t take the 3 day potty training route), figured out how to blow her nose, uses the correct personal pronouns more often, and eagerly takes on older sister roles, like feeding the baby, or watching and/or playing with him (ie. bossing him around) while mommy is momentarily occupied or keeping a watchful eye from a distance, which when he co-operates is quite wonderful as I can multi-task. She also enjoys finishing off her brother&#8217;s unfinished leftovers, which I remember I enjoyed too when my younger brother was eating baby food. Lately though, she has also reverted to not wanting to sleep on her own at night and wakes up multiple times in one night.<br />
Things that have not changed much through the first three years:</p>
<ol>
<li>She is&nbsp; happy to be the cautious observer-follower instead of the leader, though she can be determined/persistent (aka stubborn, like both her parents) &#8211; which sometimes translates to being fiesty, and/or bossy. For her, being a cautious observer seems to lends well to having an eye for detail and a good memory.</li>
<li>She hates the feeling of tears and runny nose on her face when it is caused by crying and she refuses to wipe it herself. The more you make her, the more water works result &#8211; a vicious cycle, really. Meltdowns often happen around some seemingly inconsequential thing, but it&#8217;s really a build-up of unsaid/unresolved feelings inside (maybe it&#8217;s feeling like she&#8217;s not being heard or lack of closeness / security that you&#8217;re there)</li>
<li>Early enthused independence of feeding herself does not translate to continued self-independence</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<h2>2:</h2>
<p>In other developmental news, our almost 8-month old can now roll over from front to back, and back to front, though I think he really just rolls in one direction each way. He also can sit up unassisted for extended periods, and we have been practicing moving by trying to place items he wants a little beyond his reach. While he mouths everything, I can already sense that he is a much pickier eater than Bean was, despite his love for bananas and apples and sometimes sweet potatoes; he appears to really dislike yogurt, and maybe because it&#8217;s really cold and when upon skin contact, it turned red (like it did with peanut oil, tomatoes, and oranges for Bean). While we haven&#8217;t given rice cereal after that one time when he threw it all up, he doesn&#8217;t seem to have any problems with regular rice or barley. We need to give him more opportunities to practice grabbing food and eating it, which he has been with chunks of bananas, raw chunks of apples and celery sticks (a perfect gnawing/teething food I find), cooked zucchini and pasta tubes (rigatoni), a messy experiment as it often ends up on the floor, though I might try cooked broccoli florets or carrots next; the harder foods like apples and celery I need to watch closely as sometimes he swallows before chewing it well.&nbsp; He&#8217;s still a relatively chill baby, which I am especially thankful for&nbsp;as I don&#8217;t think I would be able to handle two of the same temperaments; he is content to spend time in the playpen (or modern term: play yard) with his toys or chewing on a toy in his swing, preferring these two items more often than in the bouncer, and I can leave him for a short to an extended period, depending on his mood, before he complains, whereas his sister would still prefer that I am next to her all the time, if she had her way.&nbsp; I&#8217;m glad our playpen is getting some use, as Bean didn&#8217;t like it back then (same story with Sophie la giraffe), although she now enjoys going inside at times to sit and play with him! He&#8217;s also been able to effectively eliminate on the mini toilet seat a few times which saved me from having to clean up a messy (cloth) diaper, but we have also encountered baby in pain while trying to strain, poor boy.</p>
<blockquote><p>For this boy I prayed, and the Lord has given me my petition which I asked of Him. So I have also dedicated him to the Lord; as long as he lives he is dedicated to the Lord.&#8221; &#8211; 1 Samuel 1:27-28a (NASB)<br />
Train up a child in the way he should go: and when he is old, he will not depart from it.&#8221; &#8211; Proverbs 22:6 (KJV)</p></blockquote>
<p>As parents, we feel that it is important to lead and spiritually nurture our children so that they will develop a desire to love God and be followers of Christ, so&nbsp; while we had a small baby dedication ceremony at Bean&#8217;s one-month celebration, we decided to wait until j.w&#8217;s family could join us and held off until this year&#8217;s baptism service at our church (which effectively became a baptism + baby dedication service); it was especially meaningful to see our friends and family who don&#8217;t normally go our church present as I felt like they&#8217;re the ones that will support us in raising our children[ref]it takes a village, as the saying goes [/ref].</p>
<hr />
<h2>3:</h2>
<p>A friend recently commented that I look thinner yet again, and to my surprise when I stepped on the scale, she was right. Turns out it took me almost 8 months, 3 months longer to reach the low end of my last postpartum weight loss, and more &#8211; no wonder my pants all feel loose; I was beginning to attribute it to pregnancy stretching them out.&nbsp; I&#8217;d better consult the &#8220;<a href="http://her.happyhippos.ca/2013/12/how-to-gain-more-weight/">How to gain more weight</a>&#8221; post again. /86		</p>

Around 6:30 AM one morning, Bean woke up and didn&#8217;t go back to sleep but was content to lie in bed with me. At some point, she told me that something was bothering her at the back of her head (her one-worded summary: &#8220;ow&#8221;), near the nape of her neck. In my sleepy haze, I parted her hair and took a peek. A skin-coloured lump, almost the size of my pinky fingernail, puzzled and troubled me so I tried to get a closer look with a tissue because I didn&#8217;t want to touch it because it looked like it had hair follicles, which also sort of resembled short insect-like legs. So, trying to hide my &#8220;heebies jeebies&#8221;[ref]the &#8220;heebie jeebies&#8221; accurately sums how I feel, as used by one forum poster with his experience[/ref], I asked her if she wanted Daddy or Grandma to come in to help me, and she said Grandma, so I went to get a second opinion. Grandma later told me she took a video and some photos and sent it to a doctor friend of hers, who admitted he didn&#8217;t know what it was, perhaps an insect bite or an infection with a sac. We made an appointment with our family doctor, and I started googling and looking for images of skin tags that matched what I had seen &#8211; nothing that looked that size, even though the description seemed to match.<br />
At the doctor&#8217;s office, the nurse and the doctor took a look and confirmed that it was a skin tag. Her explanation was in line with what I had read online: that they&#8217;re benign, often made of the same cells and components of your skin, so you will see things like hair follicles, and that this one had a stalk. I couldn&#8217;t figure out how I missed it (since I comb her hair daily), but I asked how long it could have been there for, and she explained that it could have been there for awhile but was hard to spot because it wasn&#8217;t bothering Bean. She told us that it look like it was going to auto-amputate because the stalk end/base was starting to turn bluish, so we had a few options:</p>
<ol>
<li>Leave it be, and see how long it would take. Usually for smaller skin tags, it takes 2-3 days, but this one could be slower because of its size.</li>
<li>Use liquid nitrogen to burn it off. I asked how the pain would be compared to a needle, and she said it would probably be the same intensity but longer.</li>
<li>Something similar to #2 but with local freezing. We opted to go with this.</li>
</ol>
<p><figure id="attachment_5269" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5269" style="width: 225px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/715.jpg"><img class="wp-image-5269 size-medium" src="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/715-225x300.jpg" alt="tick-closeup" height="300" width="225" srcset="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/715-225x300.jpg 225w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/715-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/715.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-5269" class="wp-caption-text">Photo courtesy of our doctor</figcaption></figure><br />
For whatever reason, she decided to take a second look, and this time, IT MOVED. I appreciate that she didn&#8217;t freak out, because I would have &#8211; and certainly did inside. Instead, she calmly said that she was going outside to get a second doctor&#8217;s opinion and help. The second doctor was a lot more certain that it was a tick and they partnered to quickly remove it with a pair of tweezers; it was still very much alive in the urine sample jar they put it in, so we assume that every bit came out (thus reducing Lyme disease, if at risk) &#8211; the second doctor must have really wanted to make sure for he must have pulled extra skin and hair off, because Bean started crying even more and I was handed a piece of gauze to apply pressure to stop the bleeding[ref]a week later, the spot looks raised with a dark scab, and it must feel tender because it still bothers her[/ref]. Google helped identify the tick as a dog tick, which isn&#8217;t as great of a threat as the black-legged ticks, but they jarred it anyway to be sent for analysis. She called a contact to see if we needed to start antibiotic treatment, as their guidelines only offered advice to those over 8 years of age. Later, she also followed up to tell us that Public Health would call if they found something of concern and texted us some close-up photos. We don&#8217;t have a dog, but we did go to the urban natural area the day before, and that&#8217;s likely where we picked it up.<br />
I also appreciated that she apologized and retracted her first diagnosis; she had seen ticks before, but none this size[ref]I don&#8217;t blame her &#8211; Google tells me that it was an adult female in its partially fed state so it would be bigger[/ref]. She&#8217;s a family doctor, so I can&#8217;t expect her to know everything, even though we hope they know what ails us. She recognized that even though I had made comments about characteristics reminding me of an insect, it was likely that everyone&#8217;s quick glance assumptions as a skin tag threw everyone off.<br />
<figure id="attachment_5267" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5267" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/20160623_144856_edit.jpg"><img class="wp-image-5267 size-medium" src="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/20160623_144856_edit-300x224.jpg" alt="topview-tickinjar" height="224" width="300" srcset="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/20160623_144856_edit-300x224.jpg 300w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/20160623_144856_edit.jpg 436w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-5267" class="wp-caption-text">Looking from the outside of the jar &#8211; doesn&#8217;t look as big as the close up, nor as creepy as when it was on her head.</figcaption></figure><br />
I like being outdoors. I enjoy aspects of camping, canoeing, and especially hiking; I remember my dad would take us on walks and bike rides around trails when we were much younger. In all my years doing activities outdoors, I would have never imagined having to deal with this. Thankfully, I think this experience was more traumatic for me than it was for Bean, since she didn&#8217;t see what was bothering her, despite some tears and pain.<br />
Thank God that Bean noticed it, and He answered our prayers, giving wisdom to our doctor who for reason decided to do a second&nbsp; look &#8211; because who knows if we would&#8217;ve found it otherwise. Plus, I am really glad that I didn&#8217;t have to remove it myself.		</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				I can hardly believe that he&#8217;s already half a year old. Month six marks the beginning of solids. First foods: Avocado first, then sweet potato. We skipped rice cereal as the absolute first food. I enjoy making him laugh, stare intently at my silly expressions, and encouraging him to blow raspberries / bubbles.<br />
He is currently working on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rolling over from front to back</li>
<li>Starting to sit on his own for short periods of time, but I always am close by because he tends to teeter over</li>
<li>Growing his first tooth. He pulled my finger into his mouth a few days ago, and when he gnawed down my finger, I noticed something sharp. He puts everything in his mouth though (his hand was in his mouth at birth after all), but lately, he loves Sophie; I know this because he lets me know with displeasure when she&#8217;s dropped. Thank goodness they&#8217;re getting some use, because Bean didn&#8217;t put anything in her mouth, so our quality teething toys were neglected (they&#8217;re pricey!)</li>
</ul>
<p>As I celebrate[ref]in-laws came this year to help, thus relieving me to go off to get birthday freebies, enjoying a long nap (longer than a current sleep cycle at night), a dinner+dessert date with j.w, and daddy took the kids for their bed time while I enjoyed an evening out with small group friends, all #kidfree over a course of a few days![/ref] being another year older, a conversation I had with a friend from my high school days reminded me that this year is significant because it would mean I have spent almost half my life in Ontario. <em>Crazy</em>. That means after this point, I can&#8217;t and shouldn&#8217;t be calling &#8220;Vancouver&#8221; home unless I move back.<br />
Next month, Bean will turn three. We&#8217;re <em>still</em> working on toilet training &#8211; that&#8217;s the biggest challenge; I feel guilty since I missed the window of opportunity (the time when she peed without any bottoms on and realized it was on her leg, and she told me that she needed to go the second time during the same hour). As she gets older, I realize that one of her current combo strength is an eye for detail and a good memory &#8211; unless this happens with every kid. She observes and remembers the tiniest details: I ask her if she&#8217;s seen pieces of her toys&nbsp; a day or so later, she tells me; she tells me she threw the cloth diaper behind my bed a few days ago; describes what she ate and drank during her time while mommy+baby has a program; and tells me about the brown dog at a new friend&#8217;s house, with the blue leash (turns out, my husband tells me that it&#8217;s a stuffed dog &#8211; no wonder she wasn&#8217;t afraid of it!). She also seems to notice or ask me about things that I wouldn&#8217;t expect a toddler to pay attention to, like what&#8217;s on a specific shelf after I briefly open and close the fridge door.<br />
So here&#8217;s to getting older (but not necessarily wiser)!		</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				I cannot believe he&#8217;s five months old already! I remember the first six months of Bean&#8217;s life felt like a long time, but alas, #secondchildsyndrome; no wonder some moms with older kids miss the baby years. In a month&#8217;s time, our lives will begin to get more complicated, when he becomes more mobile and starts solids and thus, smelly and poopy diapers that are no longer water-soluble.<br />
#secondchildsyndrome means that he lacks dedicated one-on-one time with mom, resigning to being propped up on swing to observe what&#8217;s going on around him (until he gets restless and complains). Some people have asked how our second one is, and he&#8217;s still pretty chill in comparison to our first. My theory is because first-time moms are often more anxious when babe is still growing inside, but with subsequent pregnancies, they become more &#8216;lax, so it somehow transfers to them. As parents, we&#8217;re not supposed to compare our children &#8211; especially in front of them, but I can&#8217;t help but say that there are definitely traits that the siblings share, but he&#8217;s also very different from his sister:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Similarities</strong>: they both had a phase where they disliked car rides, and let me tell you that driving with a crying baby is very stressful and makes for a very unpleasant ride for everyone (though the toddler&#8217;s coping mechanism seems to be singing to herself); they both battled a severe bought of eczema; when there are visual distractions around, they fall asleep faster and stay asleep longer with a breathable covering over their heads; a bald spot appeared on their back of their heads from shaking their heads back and forth vigorously on their sleeping surfaces; they now share the same size diapers</li>
<li><strong>Differences</strong>: he tolerates the swing; can fall asleep on his own fairly quickly when he is swaddled and has a pacifier; does not fall asleep much while breastfeeding and will finish a feed fairly quickly; he happily puts everything in his mouth (after all, he was pretty much born sucking on his hand, which means we might have to baby-proof the house which we didn&#8217;t have to worry about before); he is a heavy baby, chubs, with a big head (he&#8217;s now around 16-17 lbs) &#8211; thankfully that was of the boy and not the girl, and thankfully for the second, since my muscles are slightly used to the heavier first child</li>
</ul>
<p>#secondchildsyndrome means that I almost missed some milestones, or failed to record them &#8211; including a lack of photos, especially photos with the entire family and me and him together:</p>
<ul>
<li>lots of cooing still; he has discovered how to blow bubbles and figured out how to make a high-pitched squeal &#8211; which is amusing because his friend, just a couple of months older than him went through the same thing a few weeks ago (and he reminded her to blow bubbles again haha)</li>
<li>he knows how to reach up to play with toys &#8211; I put him in the play pen and I had dangled a toy off the mobile, and he reached up to play with it</li>
<li>he also managed to rotate 90 degrees in the playpen &#8211; probably by pushing his feet against the sides</li>
<li>tummy time is a bit easier for him now &#8211; he can hold his head up longer before complaining (instead of a face plant into the floor)</li>
<li>he can almost sit up like a tripod (bent forward toward his toes)</li>
<li>he sits up better in the bumbo these days, but he still tends to lean sideways shortly after he&#8217;s in</li>
<li>his sleep-cycle is more regular: 2 in the morning (30-40 min nap within 2 hours of the morning wake-up, then another 30-40 min nap 2 hours after that, usually around when we eat lunch thankfully), and 1 long nap in the afternoon (when toddler is sleeping &#8211; first by himself, and then with me feeding/holding him), a short nap just before or during dinner, and bed time around when the toddler sleeps</li>
</ul>
<p>In toddler news, her current favourite colour is green and ESL English/Chinglish is picking up speed, despite a Chinese accent that accompanies it (though her English seems more whiny than her Chinese &#8211; not sure if it&#8217;s just the tone of voice). Her appetite is growing, and pan-fried, grandma-made potsticker dumplings are one of our favourite lunch meals right now, because she feeds herself &#8211; with chopsticks &#8211; for most of the meal, and she can eat up to 7 dumplings at a time! The other day, at her friend&#8217;s 5yo birthday party, she was one of the few younger ones who enjoyed following the dance teacher&#8217;s instructions &#8211; maybe it&#8217;s time to sign her up in some form of group lessons or activity soon.		</p>

Wow! After a little more than two and a half years, Bean is now naturally okay with me leaving the room before falling asleep &#8211; which leaves me with a little more free time in the evenings and some time in the afternoon when her brother is napping. &nbsp;She surprised me when&nbsp;she practically kicked me out during one of her naps when she heard her brother crying the other day, saying that I needed to feed him. Now, I tell her that I&#8217;ve forgotten to brush my teeth, she chimes in and tells me that I&#8217;ve forgotten to shower, and sends me away after I tuck her in and telling her she doesn&#8217;t need to be scared, and leaving the door open a crack. After hearing my mother tell me that if I don&#8217;t let her cry it out, then she will continue to need me until years later (like&nbsp;into school age), I wasn&#8217;t quite prepared for this as she was still making sure to hug me closer when she heard her brother cry just a week or two ago, and then reluctantly let me go after I told her I would come back. We&#8217;re on Day 3 &#8211; dare I&nbsp;hope that this will become a new routine that sticks?		</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				To pee or not to pee, that is the question.<br />
I sometimes wonder whether our toddler feels the urge to go at the most inconvenient times on purpose: in the middle of the meal, or when she&#8217;s supposed to be falling asleep after lights out or during nap time. Of course, this prolongs either routine, and every time I take her, she does of course actually go. But when I ask her if she needs to go outside of those times, of course she doesn&#8217;t (and won&#8217;t). And then, there&#8217;s this&nbsp;strange habit of sucking on her finger when she has the urge to go, which is a nice visual cue for me if I catch it, because she doesn&#8217;t always tell me. Ah, the joys of toilet training (on her schedule instead of a 3 day boot camp schedule).<br />
Woo-hoo! Today marks the first day that the baby fell asleep before the toddler&#8217;s nap time and napped&nbsp;through the long excruciating process, leaving my hands free to pull tissues to wipe her tears and nose while trying to wait for her to fall asleep. Sadly, it&#8217;s the pacifier that saves the day.		</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				Continuing on the theme of two, and just before&nbsp;the second month of the year, Bean reached two and a half, and here&#8217;s what she&#8217;s been learning (play-based):</p>
<h3>Language</h3>
<p>In under two playdates with a 4-year old, her English vocabulary and frequency of use&nbsp;has exploded; now, it&#8217;s almost as if her English switch gets turned on as soon as she steps into her play area. Whether she use words in the right context, or put together nonsensical sentences or words which I know is her attempt at English, she isn&#8217;t afraid to try &#8211; and persist when we don&#8217;t understand her. When she first&nbsp;started speaking (signing and Cantonese), we understood her &#8211; it was almost as if she saved up all she learned before speaking, so this babbling is new to us! I&#8217;m certain she understands more than she can express, which generally happens when one learns a new language; it&#8217;s easier to pick up a language when reading and listening than speaking and writing.<br />
As I listen to her speak more and more English day after day (which I worry she might soon forget her Chinese), I wonder how much more quickly we would pick up a language if we adults approached language learning that way: not being afraid to just go for it even when you might not make sense.<br />
For some of&nbsp;her Cantonese, sometimes I can tell who she has&nbsp;picked it up from based on the words&nbsp;she uses. For example, if I hear &#8220;啜筒&#8221; (<em>zyut tung</em>), I know it&#8217;s from Joseph and his side of the family, because I say &#8220;飲筒&#8221; (<em>yum tung</em>); likewise with &#8220;裡<span class="hps">頭</span>&#8221; (<em>lui tou</em>), I say &#8220;裏邊/面&#8221; (<em>lui bian/mian</em>) instead.</p>
<h3>Music</h3>
<p>She still enjoys singing songs and will spontaneously break out in song all day long, especially ones with actions &#8211; either ones that she&#8217;s been singing at Music and Movement, the library, or ones I&#8217;ve been teaching&nbsp;her &#8211; so I am&nbsp;trying o find Christian songs that are easy to learn in Cantonese to pass on (so far, I&#8217;ve managed <em>Jesus Loves Me</em> with 2 missing words, and parts of two other songs I sang in my childhood).</p>
<h3>Colours and Letters</h3>

She&#8217;s also at the point where she will make and remember associations, so I&#8217;ve found success with helping her identify colours and alphabet letters, although sometimes, she will just say &nbsp;the association, like &#8220;Daddy&#8221; instead of &#8220;D&#8221; &#8211; but I know that she recognizes that letter now, because she says the same association every time.&nbsp;Other letters she recognizes is O, &#8220;Breanna&#8221; or &#8220;Baby&#8221; B, &#8220;mama&#8221; E (maybe because&nbsp;of&nbsp;my name?), &#8220;doggie-bone&#8221; I,&nbsp;sometimes &#8220;moon-crescent&#8221; C and &#8220;snake&#8221; S, &nbsp;and consistently &#8220;Leia P&#8221; (but it&#8217;s really an A). This opens up new activities to try, such as at&nbsp;restaurants, instead of doing word search on the kids menu, we do letter search.<br />
For colours, we&#8217;ve progressed from doggie brown to sunshine yellow and fire engine red &#8211; and she just somehow knows the colour green, so it&#8217;s her favourite colour of the moment. She can sometimes also identify cloud/blueberry blue, purple and pink. With her new-found love for green, she has also begun to collect objects of the same colour and sort them.</p>
<h3>Doing</h3>

She has started to assert more independence (which often leads to doing especially when told not to do), or wanting to do more things on her own, so I&#8217;ve asked her to help me get a diaper and wipe when changing her brother, pick out her table setting and bring it to the table at meal times, (re)wash her bib after she&#8217;s done with it, and let her figure out how to put on a pair of elastic-waist pants and bite my tongue when it ends up being backwards.<br />

I know many children at this age can put on clothes, socks, jackets, etc. but we haven&#8217;t mastered those skills yet. Toilet-training is also slow progress &#8211; some days she knows and will tell me she needs to go, and other days, she is happy to pee in her training underwear and not care or seem to notice the couch has gotten wet (still thankful she self-trained for poop for over a year now).<br />

Meals are still spent half self-feeding, with help from an adult once she gets bored with self-feeding (or isn&#8217;t as hungry anymore), especially with food choices that aren&#8217;t as easy to self feed because it requires utensils or may be messier, like soup noodles or rice with <em>soong</em>; she can pretty much eat an entire sandwich or a serving of sushi rolls on her own though.<br />
<figure id="attachment_5136" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5136" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img width="300" height="277" class="wp-image-5136 size-medium" alt="scissors-fun" src="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_20160124_103106-e1455855963415-300x277.jpg" srcset="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_20160124_103106-e1455855963415-300x277.jpg 300w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_20160124_103106-e1455855963415-768x708.jpg 768w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_20160124_103106-e1455855963415-1024x944.jpg 1024w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_20160124_103106-e1455855963415-1568x1446.jpg 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-5136" class="wp-caption-text">Attempting to cut on the line with a pair of blunt scissors</figcaption></figure><br />
When it comes to art and drawing, she&#8217;s starting to be able to trace around objects and the other day, she coloured within the lines &#8211; we have yet to find out if that was an accident or not. She is starting to cut by following lines with scissors and thread objects through a pipe cleaner, but she&#8217;s not at the point where she does it repeatedly / enjoys it yet.&nbsp;<br />
This afternoon&#8217;s&nbsp;blog post is brought to you by the peace and quiet of two children napping away, a first! Will report back at three; hope it&nbsp;won&#8217;t be&nbsp;the terrifying threes.		</p>
