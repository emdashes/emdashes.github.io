								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				I&#8217;m at the age where I&#8217;m comfortable with shopping and ordering online. And while I prefer to text and instant message people over chatting on the phone, I felt uneasy texting an unknown Toronto number to order a box of brownies for local delivery; so, my age is beginning to show, perhaps?<br />
The other day, I came across an ad on Facebook: the premise is that you text a number to order some treats (brownies in this case), and they deliver to your door. The conversation started on Facebook Messenger and then transitioned over to SMS, where I was able to order a box of dairy-and-nut-free, reduced-sugar brownies. Sure enough, that evening, a box of brownies showed up at the door, with a real person &#8211; the baker &#8211; behind it.<br />
My first SMS order was a success! And while I feel like this way might be more personal and a cheaper than ordering through an e-commerce site, traditional credibility (ethos) goes out the window, which impacts the professional image. It didn&#8217;t help that they wanted me to give an online review on a Facebook group in exchange for free delivery, and when they told me they took square (for credit card payments), I expected to pay with a credit card, but on delivery, he told me he didn&#8217;t bring it because everyone paid with cash (square charges a fee). I also took measures to use a throwaway SMS number as I didn&#8217;t want a business to have my personal mobile number for other marketing purposes.</p>

But I probably would order from <a href="https://www.facebook.com/bakehurry/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bake-Hurry</a> again &#8211; especially if they had a promo since dairy-free and nut-free baked treats are hard to come by! When local hipster cafes and bakeries start charging an upwards of $4 for a square brownie, a box of 24 decently sized pieces of freshly baked custom brownies for $30 (or $20 for first time customers) becomes a great price and I like being able to support our local small businesses. The way they are boxed makes them look homemade, but they do come from a rented commercial kitchen (Courtyard Kitchens), in the same building as <a href="https://www.fourall.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Four All Ice Cream</a> in Kitchener. I should have frozen some had I done some pricing research since they should last up to a month in the freezer or a week in the fridge. They do have a nice chocolately crunch on the outside with a soft chew on the inside, just as advertised, and just the way I like my freshly baked cookies. I&#8217;m glad I asked for reduced sugar because I found it sufficiently sweet &#8211; the regular version would probably have been too sweet for me. A friend commented on the texture, that it reminded her of mooncake, but perhaps that is because it is the dairy-free version?<br />
Same day (from order to) delivery is another win in my books, as it&#8217;s perfect for those cravings (for dessert, a sweet bite, or those midnight munchies &#8211; like right now) and last minute meal prep and I don&#8217;t have to go out to get them, especially if I don&#8217;t want to lug my kids around with me.		</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				The local libraries here aren&#8217;t your typical traditional ones; sure you can borrow books, but they offer so much more. In addition to having resources like a media centre with a 3D printer and VR games, library patrons can borrow video games, toys, museum passes, and even internet hotspots; they also offer some really interesting programs for different age groups. I&#8217;m no stranger to circle time with wee ones, crafting terrariums, breaking out from a mini-escape-room, <a href="http://her.happyhippos.ca/2015/05/coffee-notes/">learning about </a>coffee, or watching new DVD releases in the library&#8217;s little theatre; everything is at and hosted by the library, and the best part is that they are all free! I sometimes wish I had more time or the waitlist to some of these weren&#8217;t so long (like the upcoming social paint nite and refreshments) [ref] this one filled up within 10 mins of open-registration[/ref])!<br />
<span style="font-size: 16px;"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-5592" src="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_20170123_194337-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="739" height="554" srcset="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_20170123_194337-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_20170123_194337-300x225.jpg 300w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_20170123_194337-768x576.jpg 768w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_20170123_194337.jpg 1447w" sizes="(max-width: 739px) 100vw, 739px" />The other night, Ryan Horne from </span><a style="font-size: 16px;" href="https://www.facebook.com/foragergreens/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@ForagerGreens</a><span style="font-size: 16px;"> graciously gave a workshop at the library on how to make kombucha, offered samples of some of his kombucha, and brought everyone a container of starter brew + SCOBY (ready to be added to freshly brewed sweet tea). At the workshop, we found that he sells the starter kit for $20, so we just saved ourselves $20 &#8211; though it&#8217;s really the SCOBY that we&#8217;re after, as everything else we can easily source! Like </span><a style="font-size: 16px;" href="http://her.happyhippos.ca/2014/01/kefir-and-breast-milk/">the kefir</a><span style="font-size: 16px;"> that j.w now makes and drinks (whereby Bean happily drinks plain and gulps down the whey as if it was juice), all one needs is the active ingredient (Kefir &#8211; grains; Kombucha &#8211; SCOBY), and you&#8217;re good to go for awhile.</span><br />
I don&#8217;t know how my first batch will turn out; it&#8217;s sitting on another counter away from the kefir. If it&#8217;s doing what it&#8217;s supposed to be doing, the tea <del>will turn</del> is turning lighter, almost to a golden hue, as the week progresses, and a new layer of SCOBY <del>will be formed</del> is forming on top. Unlike kefir where you see a distinct separation of the &#8220;curds&#8221; and whey, there seems to be no obvious visual indicator, other than the color and that the SCOBY has formed a layer across / seal &#8211; and only if you&#8217;re paying attention. However, the final indication of both is the taste-test; if you like it, it&#8217;s ready.<br />
Before my notes get all wrinkled and smudged, here&#8217;s what to know about kombucha:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kombucha" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">kombucha</a>, Japanese in origin to mean &#8220;kelp tea&#8221; [ref]makes sense to me, since the stringy yeast on the SCOBY reminds me of kelp / seaweed at times[/ref], now it means fermented (sweet) tea. If you buy a commercial bottle in stores, you could spend anywhere from 3$ to 6$! Essentially, it&#8217;s made up of starter brew+SCOBY+brewed sweet tea.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Starter Brew</h2>
<p>Fully brewed kombucha should smell like vinegar (or a faint smell if it&#8217;s not too strong), and a formula for starter brew comprises of: 1-2 cups of full brewed kombucha (the starter liquid) + SCOBY that is at least 1/8 inch thick (5oz) and should cover at least 1/2 of the surface area / opening of the jar/container/vessel, which is added to 1 gallon brewed tea; the more SCOBY you have, the more likely you will succeed. If you don&#8217;t have starter liquid, you can substitute it for a 1/4 cup of distilled vinegar.</p>
<h2>SCOBY</h2>
<p>What&#8217;s a SCOBY? It stands for Symbiotic Culture of Bacteria and Yeast.</p>
<ul>
<li>A healthy one can look like a thin puck and it&#8217;s not unusual to see spits, holes, strands, floaties and strings of yeast[ref]edible, but most people filter it out[/ref]. When you pick it up, it should stay together and shouldn&#8217;t tear easily. A new SCOBY is beige, creamy in colour; the underside will likely look more weird than the top side, and colours of blue or purple aren&#8217;t unusual; it might sink, and that&#8217;s okay. If your container is too small for the SCOBY, it is safe to cut it up.</li>
<li>An older SCOBY can turn brown, work slower or stop working, but you can just keep it there in the batch. However, if you see mold on it, just scrap it and start new.   Signs of mold include powdery, dry splotches, specks in black, blue, or white; people have compared it to mold on an orange or a piece of bread.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Brew Environment and Equipment</h2>
<ul>
<li>Making an ideal brew: it thrives in 73-85F temperature, out of direct sunlight and avoid an exterior wall if possible. Don&#8217;t fill the container too full: leave some breathing space at the top of the container for the ecosystem to work; it also needs a &#8220;lid&#8221; that breathes such as a paper coffee filter, dish towel, or a piece of paper towel.</li>
<li>Food-grade plastic, glass, or stainless steel is okay, despite what online research may say</li>
</ul>
<h2>Brewing Sweet Tea</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<h3>Water</h3>
<ul>
<li>Must be chlorine-free, clean, potable</li>
<li>Avoid minerals &#8211; hard water can slow it down or kill it so if you&#8217;re using tap, boil it first and then let it sit overnight; then reboil it for tea</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Sugar</h3>
<ul>
<li>1 cup sugar per 4L / 1 gallon of tea / kombucha. Don&#8217;t worry, 50-80% of the sugar gets converted</li>
<li>White is good; evaporated cane juice crystals is the best choice. A bag of Kirkland organic cane sugar is supposedly only $4!</li>
<li>If you decided to use honey, he recommends that you get the pasteurized kind because the raw, unpasteurized kind contains anti-bacterial properties, thus may kill it[ref]Jun, is a honey-based kombucha, and <a href="http://www.kombuchabrooklyn.com/blog/jun-honey-based-kombucha/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">using raw honey</a> seems to yield success[/ref]. Honey will result in a faster brew; same with maple syrup, so use less if you use either kind.</li>
<li>Do not use artificial or plant sugar (e.g. stevia, agave), as it won&#8217;t work</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Tea</h3>
<ul>
<li>Black tea is the best; use bagged or loose</li>
<li>Avoid flavoured or herbal teas; any natural oils in them can kill the SCOBY (makes sense since some <a href="http://her.happyhippos.ca/2017/01/essential-oils-when-less-is-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">essential oils</a> have anti-fungal, anti-bacterial properties)</li>
<li>Should just stay &#8220;tea&#8221; in the ingredients; decaf is okay</li>
<li>Boil 4-5 bags of tea in a 2 gallon pot of water for 15+ minutes; cool it down to lower than body temperature before adding it to the starter brew</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Ready State</h2>
<ul>
<li>Is the kombucha ready to drink? You can use a straw (and a finger to suck up some tea) for the taste test, or more scientifically, you can also use PH strips to check for the ideal 3.5 PH; a PH of 4.0 is indicative of a new batch, &lt;3.0 is more potent. For a 2 gallon batch, it will start stating like apple cider vinegar around Day 5, and generally, a batch would be ready in about 7-10 days. If you want to slow the process down, you can put the whole thing in the fridge. You can pour it out in a batch and leave some starter brew (batch brew), or add a new batch of freshly brewed tea to the container (continuous brew)</li>
<li>When it&#8217;s ready, you can do a secondary fermentation, where you add 10-20% of fruit or other flavours in a bottle of ready kombucha, such as ginger or pear, with or without pulp. Leave it in room temperature for 1-5 days. Sealed will make more carbonation (be careful when opening)</li>
<li>You can put it in the fridge to cool it before drinking, or you can drink it straight up.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Clean up</h2>
<p>When washing the jars and other equipment for kombucha, don&#8217;t use antibacterial soap, including on your hand; you can easily use hot water and vinegar to wash and rinse.<br />
ENJOY!		</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				When some friends asked me for suggestions for local hiking trails or places for a nice nature walk, I had to pause and use my memory and Google to help[ref]so I guess I can&#8217;t blame them if all they could find was a hike that charged $7 a person to see a waterfall some 40 mins away[/ref]; it can sure be challenge to find suitable ideas.<br />
To be honest, I&#8217;ve always wanted to explore some trails but have only maybe done a few as many of these trails are linear (and goes on for hours or days &#8211; with trail access at varies points) instead of loops, so it feels like there&#8217;s a lot more effort to do them (either doubling back or need to park two cars and shuttle back), but this time of the year is probably one of my favourite times to do nature walks[ref]I call them walks instead of hikes as I&#8217;m used to West Coast terrain[/ref].<br />
<a href="https://flic.kr/p/aCyEwY"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/6052/6320977980_5e41dff727_z.jpg" alt="IMG_9665" width="640" height="426" /></a><br />
So, here are some in KWC for my (and hopefully your) future reference &#8211; most of which I&#8217;ve narrowed down based on distance / time and how scenic or interesting the trail might be:</p>
<h3>Cambridge</h3>
<ul>
<li>Devil&#8217;s Creek Trail</li>
<li><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.raresites.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/seasonal-cliffs-and-alvars-trail-map.png" target="_blank" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=http://i2.wp.com/www.raresites.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/seasonal-cliffs-and-alvars-trail-map.png&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1476758739398000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGXMrMJMVUn2C6gI8iwmhIFpnF7xg" rel="noopener noreferrer">Trails along Blair Road (RARE):</a> the river side one has cliffs and water and a lookout (could extend to a loop); I always want to walk along this one when I drive by it</li>
</ul>
<h3>Kitchener</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.ontariotrails.on.ca/trails/view/homer-watson-park-trail" target="_blank" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=http://www.ontariotrails.on.ca/trails/view/homer-watson-park-trail&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1476758739398000&amp;usg=AFQjCNF5qmFYeWJXYsdUNjwUdrYtYwPILA" rel="noopener noreferrer">Homer Watson Park:</a> a 10-second walk from the car leads me to my favourite spot for a fall photo (one that overlooks the Grand River with coloured trees on either side). I discovered this sometime ago, from hunting around online, as it&#8217;s hidden and tucked away, but I haven&#8217;t actually ventured too far along the trail.&nbsp; Someone has kindly documented a 8km loop if you&#8217;re feeling adventurous or park a car at one end and walk to another parking spot and drive back to get the other car &#8211; ‎<a href="http://www.hember.ca/hikes/HomerWatson/" target="_blank" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=http://www.hember.ca/hikes/HomerWatson/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1476758739398000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHoJqTlz1Ag20rPH1QpbkkUZL0aJA" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://www.hember.ca/hikes/HomerWatson/</a><br />
Or, you can try for a shorter loop: <a href="http://hember.ca/hikes/HomerWatsonDoon/index.html" target="_blank" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=http://hember.ca/hikes/HomerWatsonDoon/index.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1476758739398000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFrPAGylOPdPgrWn2f3M14duu42gA" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://hember.ca/hikes/<wbr>HomerWatsonDoon/</wbr></a></li>

<a href="https://www.kitchener.ca/en/livinginkitchener/HuronNaturalArea.asp">Huron Natural Area</a> is my go-to for urban, easy loop walks and nearest to our house (one trail goes around a pond where on a sunny day you can spot turtles sunbathing, and in the fall, the leaves look really nice across the still water). My friends ended up choosing this place, and some told me that they didn&#8217;t even know this place existed before this! (I&#8217;m glad they ended up having a nice leisurely walk)[ref]The same someone also documented a possible 5km and 8km loop:<a href="http://www.hember.ca/hikes/HuronNaturalArea/index.html" target="_blank" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=http://www.hember.ca/hikes/HuronNaturalArea/index.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1476758739398000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEVt9gnOhgms5wwwfWbkDPM1qI1qQ" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://www.hember.ca/hikes/HuronNaturalArea</a>[/ref]</li>

<h3>Waterloo/St. Jacobs</h3>
<figure style="width: 500px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a title="IMG_9667" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/aimeili/6320456853/in/album-72157602404604327/" data-flickr-embed="true" data-footer="true"><img src="https://c6.staticflickr.com/7/6110/6320456853_0f1d4eb5d1_n.jpg" alt="Race Mill trail" width="500" height="333"/></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">A Mennonite man walks with two kids across the train trestle</figcaption></figure>
<ul>
<li>Health Valley Trail: This one is a challenge to find it seems but you walk to downtown St Jacobs from Waterloo, so you could have lunch there after!</li>
<li><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>Mill Race trail: in the village of St. Jacobs, goes under a train trestle, a next to a creek in some spots, see some chipmunks or frogs, some farm land, and if you&#8217;re lucky you&#8217;ll also hear gun shots. At the end of the 2km linear trail, you will see a small dam (so it&#8217;s like a mini-waterfall, right?)</li>
<li>The <a href="http://thehydrocut.ca/">Hydrocut</a> (specifically, only the multi-use trail): this might offer a more challenging terrain (enter via the <a href="http://thehydrocut.ca/trails-map">Snyders Road parking lot</a>) ‎but be warned that despite it being a multi-use trail, you may encounter many mountain biking enthusiasts &#8211; as it&#8217;s &#8220;their&#8221; trail around here. And I&#8217;ve been told there&#8217;s plenty of mosquitoes (but I&#8217;d imagine other places w trees and water might too)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.waterloo.ca/en/gettingactive/geotimetrail.asp">GeoTime trail</a>: This 4.5 km one seems like it would be an informative / educational walk vs. a hike &#8211; the concept is kind of neat, and I didn&#8217;t know this existed either; thanks, @jowu!</li>
</ul>
<p>And then, there are walks with a purpose: to <a href="https://fallingfruit.org/?z=16&amp;y=43.43180&amp;x=-80.49604&amp;m=false&amp;t=roadmap&amp;l=true&amp;locale=en&amp;c=forager,freegan">harvest fruit</a> along the pathways!<br />
Are there anymore that are worth checking out?		</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				I often look forward to Saturdays because there is still one more day left before the work week begins again. If I don&#8217;t have a chance to sleep in, and j.w doesn&#8217;t take the kids (or leaves me one while he plays MTG), it means that we can spend time together as a family &#8211;&nbsp;this usually means we do our weekly shopping trip at Costco or&nbsp;the Kitchener Market.<br />
A couple Saturdays ago, it was certainly a nice kind of different:&nbsp;we took part of a little library&nbsp;community build and we visited the region&#8217;s waste management site. &nbsp;</p>
<h3>Little Library &#8211; Community Build</h3>
<p><figure id="attachment_5221" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5221" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="size-medium wp-image-5221" src="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/IMG_20160423_093522-e1462586310284-300x300.jpg" alt="little library materials" height="300" width="300" srcset="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/IMG_20160423_093522-e1462586310284-300x300.jpg 300w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/IMG_20160423_093522-e1462586310284-150x150.jpg 150w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/IMG_20160423_093522-e1462586310284-768x768.jpg 768w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/IMG_20160423_093522-e1462586310284-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/IMG_20160423_093522-e1462586310284-1568x1568.jpg 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-5221" class="wp-caption-text">Little library build, gable-style</figcaption></figure><br />
At the start of the year,&nbsp;I had shared with j.w two of my <del>resolutions</del>[ref]I don&#8217;t believe in resolutions as I don&#8217;t (like to) make promises I can&#8217;t keep[/ref] goals for the year, which he has helped me to meet: make our bed daily (a little step towards to tidiness) and get a little library up and running in our front yard (community).<br />
A community build event took place and j.w put together most of the little library house. To our surprise, we now share another thing in common with our neighbours two houses down: not only do our sons share the same first name, but they also have the same gable-style library that they picked up the same morning!<br />
Sometime this summer, I aim to paint/stain it, seal it, and then put it up with some family-friendly reading, primarily books in the Christian and children genre. While there are plenty of other little libraries with children&#8217;s literature, I wonder what the uptake will be on Christian books. I have other little ideas for it, including maybe a Facebook group to post what&#8217;s available, a NFC check-in tag, as well a QR tag to track the location and review of the books that go through our little library &#8211; those are lofty ideas, so we shall see.</p>
<h3>Waterloo Region Waste Management &#8211; Open House</h3>
<p><figure id="attachment_5222" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5222" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="wp-image-5222 size-medium" src="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/IMG_20160423_122123-300x225.jpg" alt="Recycled material" height="225" width="300" srcset="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/IMG_20160423_122123-300x225.jpg 300w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/IMG_20160423_122123-768x576.jpg 768w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/IMG_20160423_122123-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/IMG_20160423_122123-1568x1176.jpg 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-5222" class="wp-caption-text">Cubes of compacted recycled cans</figcaption></figure><br />
After a morning of building most of the little library, we rushed to the waste management site. I had signed us up to go because of Bean&#8217;s interest in garbage trucks and buses &#8211; a school bus was to take us on a tour of the site, with pauses at the current landfill, and a stop at the recycling centre. If their goal of open houses is to send an environmental message home, I think it achieved it with our family; it probably ended up being the most educational for us, the parents. Here&#8217;s what I learned:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_box_recycling_system#History" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The (now world-wide) blue box recycling program started in Kitchener</a></li>
<li>The waste management site &#8220;hires&#8221; two <a href="http://www.therecord.com/news-story/4260095-this-job-is-for-the-birds/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hawks to send seagulls away</a> a few times a week</li>
<li>Mount Trashmore, our local popular tobogganing hill, was discontinued as a landfill in the &#8217;70s</li>
<li>Landfills that are at max capacity are capped with ceramic before being topped with soil and grass</li>
<li>Items you throw in the garbage that you know are biodegradable or claims to biodegrade in X days won&#8217;t actually ever if it ends up in the landfill because the environment isn&#8217;t right for it; it actually gets packed down (sort of WALL-E-like), so it lacks oxygen and organisms that break it down</li>
<li>A tarp-like sheet goes over every layer of garbage to keep it from blowing away and fumes and moisture are sent through pipes, where the methane gas is collected and converted into energy; I didn&#8217;t see any burning pipes anywhere, nor did it smell nearly as bad as the one we used to drive back next to Highway 1 back home before it got converted to a driving range</li>
</ul>
<p>You could say that we unknowingly took part in some Earth Day weekend activities, with a specific focus on recycling / reusing (books in the community instead of the garbage, and learning about recycling operations in our city). It felt like a long day, but it wasn&#8217;t even mid-afternoon yet by the time we finished! While I do enjoy doing our regular stops, after this past Saturday&#8217;s activities together as a family, I find it&#8217;s worth waking up early if it means doing something different.<br />
Some neat upcoming events in May around #kwawesome that you could do with your family, a date, or friends are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Saturday, May 7, 9-10:30a <a href="http://janeswalk.org/canada/kitchener/lets-have-coffee-or-10/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Coffee walk around Downtown Kitchener (DTK)</a></li>
<li>Sunday, May 8, 2p <a href="http://janeswalk.org/canada/kitchener/spur-line-trail-smile-tiger-berlin-bicycle-cafe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Coffee tour bike-ride on Spur Line Trail</a></li>
<li>Friday, May 27, 6-7p Listening choir DTK (probably not suitable for families with little ones, as they will likely get impatient or lose attention since there&#8217;s no speaking and you stand and appreciate the urban noise) &#8211; other dates are also available</li>
</ul>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				Now that the <a href="http://her.happyhippos.ca/2015/11/things-to-do-in-kw/">adults have ideas on what #kwawesome offers</a>, here&#8217;s a list of no or low-cost drop-in programs that are toddler friendly. While the local libraries, Early Years Centres, and some community centres / associations have great programs for children and caregivers, most of them require registration. I didn&#8217;t take Bean to many programs when she was younger because they were all offered in the morning, which conflicted with her morning nap; now that she&#8217;s just napping in the afternoon, these times work better for us. Drop-in programs are also great for us because it allows flexibility: on low-key days,  or the times we don&#8217;t have the car or the weather isn&#8217;t bussing or walking friendly, we can choose to stay in.<br />
This list is really to help me keep a track of what&#8217;s being offered during the fall and winter terms around us (the start of summer usually means the end of some programs):</p>
<ol>

<li><strong>Wednesdays:</strong> <em>to be determined, but you can always bring them to The Museum ($5 admission Wednesdays, free for child under 3)<br />
Or join <a href="http://www.ourplacekw.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Early Years Centre for Music and Movement</a> (offered weekdays. Songs with actions and parachute fun), 11:30-noon free (gym open for use prior to program), or <a href="https://creeksidechurch.ca/playground/">Creekside Church indoor playground,</a> 9:30-11:30 AM free (Monday &#8211; Thursday, unstructured free play)</em></li>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>A few nights ago, a friend asked me what there was to do in Kitchener-Waterloo, and how I found out about them. This isn&#8217;t&nbsp;the first time someone has asked for ideas, so I figured a compiled list of what I follow may be helpful to my other self and for future reference &#8211; and even though I don&#8217;t necessarily have time do venture out to many events offered around time, I still try sometimes! So what piques my interest? Generally, I like to know about free/low-cost activities that don&#8217;t need&nbsp;too much&nbsp;commitment.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Here are some of my sources:</div>
<ul>
<li>Meetup groups &#8211; a few that I subscribe to, include:
<ul>
<li>Badminton Fun in KW&nbsp;&#8211; John sends out a reminder of places that offer drop-in badminton around town (mostly at community centres)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.meetup.com/Tri-Cities-Food-Lovers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tri-Cities Food Lovers &#8211;</a> I tend to follow this group for restaurant ideas (haven&#8217;t been to a meetup yet)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.meetup.com/Its-On-Events-for-20s-30s-at-Kitchener-Public-Library/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">It&#8217;s On &#8211; Events for 20s and 30s</a>&nbsp;&#8211; a central place for all the events that Kitchener Public Library offers for a specific crowd, though open to all. Note that registration actually happens on the KPL site itself, and that most of it is just a repeat of what&#8217;s listed on the KPL Events Calendar (but easier to find here).</li>
<li><a href="http://www.meetup.com/Hiking-for-Beginners-in-Cambridge-ON/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hiking for Beginners</a> &#8211; while the group says Cambridge, Ontario, I find that a bunch of the hikes are actually in the Kitchener area. I tend to follow them to discover trails around me as the timing for the meetups hasn&#8217;t been right for me yet.</li>
<li>I also follow the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/KW-Chinese-English-Language-and-Cultural-Exchange/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chinese-English Social Cultural Exchange</a> meetup group to keep a tabs on Chinese eating places around town</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Public Library events
<ul>
<li>I tend to find out about interesting events from the library posters, TV screens, and their <a href="http://www.libraryaware.com/1111/Subscribers/Subscribe?showonlynewsletterlists=true">newsletters</a>;&nbsp;e.g. Etc., Music Notes, KPL News. Popular events that have limited seats tend to fill quickly, and if you end up registering late, you&#8217;ll be added to a waitlist. A few that I&#8217;ve attended include one on <a href="http://her.happyhippos.ca/2015/05/coffee-notes/">coffee</a>, making your own terrarium during #diyfestival,&nbsp; interior design, and an upcoming ones that seem interesting&nbsp;is an&nbsp;art class, an escape room adventure featured for international games day, and a <a href="http://kplca.evanced.info/signup/EventDetails.aspx?EventId=11432&amp;lib=" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DIY string art piece</a>.</li>
<li>You can also <a href="http://kplca.evanced.info/signup/EventCalendar.aspx">filter events in the calendar</a> to browse for ones that interest you (hint: set filters by Date: today&#8217;s date, leave end date open; Event type: Adult, Arts &amp; Culture, Business; Age Group: Adults &#8211; List view). Notably, KPL Central branch offers a weekly free movie&nbsp;screening in their theatre space.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Community Centres / Community Associations tend to offer many classes at a reasonable cost, but they usually require registration and a 8-10 weeks of commitment. I find that I have to browse through the leisure guides physically because&nbsp;the online versions aren&#8217;t very browseable (ref. <a href="http://issuu.com/cityofwaterloo/docs/waterloo_fall2015_web?e=1669671/14829852" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Waterloo</a> / Kitchener). I&#8217;ve noticed that similar classes tend to vary in price depending on where it&#8217;s offered, perhaps because of&nbsp;each community centre&#8217;s surrounding demographics (e.g. Downtown Kitchener seems to have lower drop-in prices than say RIM Park in Waterloo)
<ul>
<li>Cooking classes</li>
<li>Art classes (e.g. $5 a class for drawing)</li>
<li>Language classes (e.g. ASL &#8211; $5+ /class, Spanish, Conversational Chinese &#8211; $5 a class on Saturday mornings)</li>
<li>Social Dance / Ballroom dancing&nbsp;classes, even more affordable than the ones taught at University of Waterloo (outside of&nbsp;the clubs)</li>
<li>Drop-in sport activities &#8211; organized and self-organized, such as badminton (from $3 a session)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://enews.kitchener.ca/enews/signup.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">City of Kitchener</a> and <a href="http://enews.waterloo.ca/mailinglist/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">City of Waterloo</a> newsletters, which include a Kitchener Market sub-newsletter
<ul>
<li>By extension, the <a href="http://www.downtownkitchener.ca/en/index.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Downtown Kitchener BIA </a>also offers a e-newsletter that&nbsp;highlights events such as <a href="http://nightshiftwr.ca/">NightShift</a> and Art Market, and the <a href="http://frederickartwalk.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">annual Art Walk </a>(local artisans featuring their works for sale)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Free <a href="http://www.kitchener.ca/en/livinginkitchener/public_skating_schedule.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">community skating </a>/ <a href="http://www.timhortons.com/ca/en/social/free-swimming.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">swimming / aqua-fit</a> sessions</li>
<li>Theatre:

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				For two weeks, we had the company of my family with us (minus two). I especially treasured moments between our two-year old and her cousin, who at six months younger, seemed to equal in height and just a bit more solid in terms of weight.<br />
While it seemed like they took some time to get used to the presence of each other, by the end of the visit, they played and interacted with each other without needing any encouragement from us. I now know that Bean is capable of independent play (the adults spent a whole meal eating around the dining table while the two played in the play area)! This visit seemed like they were closer than their time spent in California together, even though that was only a few months prior.<br />
I worried that Bean was going to have some withdrawal, but she seems to be coping it quite well; Mommy might be the one that ends up in withdrawal as she settles us back into a quieter routine that will likely be marked with hibernation tendencies due to the cooler weather.<br />
The two weeks seemed to go by quickly, as each day was packed with an activity, with only one or two days of resting at home. I discovered that it&#8217;s more fun and motivating to do things with others &#8211; and that there is a lot of low to no-cost activities offered here in region! Each day required some flexibility, as we often didn&#8217;t leave the house until past 10:30 or 11am, but nap times were generally around 2:30pm &#8211; sometimes&nbsp;in the car.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Our&nbsp;stay-cation</h3>
<p>Niagara area</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cousin&#8217;s wedding at Creekside Estate Winery</strong>:&nbsp;a&nbsp;lovely&nbsp;intimate evening outdoor wedding,&nbsp;with traditions brought&nbsp;in from the bride and groom&#8217;s culture &#8211; Metis and Chinese (including&nbsp;a&nbsp;tying ceremony and mooncakes). However, I couldn&#8217;t bring myself to try the cheese and crackers&nbsp;that&nbsp;many of the fruit flies feasted on &#8211;&nbsp;they can&#8217;t&nbsp;be avoided at this time of the year because of the grapes they say); we managed to catch the super moon / lunar eclipse!</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://outletcollectionatniagara.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Outlet Collection at Niagara</a></strong>&nbsp;&#8211; I found it to be more spacious with better food selection / food courts&nbsp;than Premium Outlets &#8211; though we managed to squeeze in a 30-minute power shopping stop&nbsp;at those outlets too in Milton on the way to the airport</li>
<li><strong>August 8</strong>: The Golden&nbsp;Lotus buffet at Fallsview charges a ridiculous $16 for a 2-year old (same until 10 years old) even though the adults are $20. <em>How many two year olds can eat the same amount as a ten-year old, or 4/5ths of an adult?&nbsp;</em>I enjoyed the variety and quality of the kitchen (cooked) options. They charge a more reasonable $1.20 per year of the child (free under 2). As it turns out mind you, August 8 pricing is&nbsp;actually more per person than Fallsview (because Lotus includes tax and it&#8217;s lower per adult), so&nbsp;had we gone,&nbsp;Golden Lotus would&#8217;ve saved us at least $16 in the end despite the $16 meal for the 2-year old. Ah well, at least we can say we tried August&nbsp;8 now.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<div>In town</div>
<ul>
<li><strong>Early Years Centre:</strong> Music &amp; Movement scheduled program meant that they participated in some songs and parachute fun. It was C&#8217;s first time, but she wasn&#8217;t shy about it the second time we went; they also had the opportunity to play on the Little Tikes plastic playground&nbsp;items in the open gym&nbsp;and little odds and ends in the Orange Room</li>
<li><strong>Pioneer Park Library: </strong>C was around for our first toy-borrowing experience&nbsp;so she got to play with some new toys with Bean. Bean is now super excited when she sees a new toy from the library.</li>
<li><strong>St. Jacob&#8217;s and Anna Mae&#8217;s</strong> (Millbank): We also checked out the newly rebuilt St. Jacob&#8217;s market on a Thursday, and even though it was a weekday, it was bustling with people and it seemed a lot bigger in general: with vendors outside and inside of three separate buildings! At one booth, the woman remembered me from the Etsy show two weeks ago, and I found out that she sells her&nbsp;Calendula balm was actually $2 cheaper at the market &#8211; and it seemed to be an already reasonable price at the show! ($10 tax in at the market). We managed to catch a filling lunch at Anna Mae&#8217;s, a place my parents actually stumbled upon years back, famous for their broasted chicken and pies.</li>
<li><strong>The Museum:&nbsp;</strong>It was pretty much deserted at the Museum, which allowed ample time and space for them to play and explore. The two probably spent the most time in the infant and toddler area and the boat water station (just playing with the water, not exactly directing the boats downstream). Sadly, the top floor is now more geared for adults as opposed to children &#8211; gone is the sticker and balloon rooms and the science and nutrition stations. Bean enjoyed watching her grandfather flap his arms to a dinosaur game and playing in the color-changing sand pit; she also loved the star show (where we blasted off to many planets, including Jupiter, resulting in her new favourite planet and her frequent reminder asking me, &#8220;Do you remember we went to Jupiter?&#8221;) but C was &#8220;all done&#8221; had to leave&nbsp;shortly after it begun (fear of the dark?).</li>
<li><strong>Waterloo Park (Zoo):&nbsp;</strong>Bean was a lot more hesitant about the animals roaming around behind the fences at Waterloo Park, but C seemed to enjoy them, especially the llamas, since she knows a song about them. It seems like many of the animals seems to have disappeared, leaving behind overgrown and/or empty habitats including the bunnies and pigs.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Shantz Family Farm:&nbsp;</strong>This farm is just five minutes down the road from us &#8211; I don&#8217;t know why we haven&#8217;t gone to it before as everything, including the corn maze is free. The two girls loved the plastic play toys (Little Tikes houses and slides) &nbsp;in the children&#8217;s straw maze area and Bean had a great time with accessible banana seat swings (as opposed to the diaper seats). When we visited on a weekday, it looked abandoned but this past Thanksgiving Monday, it was bustling with families &#8211; what a contrast! Bean was afraid of the animals during her first visit, but seemed to warm up to them to the point of wanting to watch and &#8220;feed&#8221; them on Thanksgiving Monday.</li>
<li><strong>Kitchener Market&nbsp;</strong>for Saturday produce and bacon shopping, iced pineapple tea and breadbaron, with a side visit to the Asian supermarket down the street. The children&#8217;s program was a bit too advanced for the two kids but they tried to glue a fall wreath together anyway.</li>
<li><strong>Oktoberfest:&nbsp;</strong>Because their visit coincided with the beginning of Oktoberfest, we took a trip downtown to check out the street vendors and happened to wander into Hockeytown instead. I thought it was a bit strange that Oktoberfest was so hockey-fied and thought maybe they were sponsors until I later learned that they were two different events in the same area. I think we enjoyed hockeytown more as they had more kid-friendly activities and freebies (including a free jersey for children under 16!).</li>
<li><strong>Stratford &#8211; The Sound of Music:&nbsp;</strong>The grandparents and j.w lovingly stayed at home to babysit while the sisters had a date to see the Sound of Music in Stratford (40 min leisurely drive &#8211; it seems like a lot shorter drive than 40 minutes on the&nbsp;401 towards Toronto for some reason), thanks to a Groupon-advertised $40 deal. We sat a row apart, next to the sound booth, but the view was great and the sound booth wasn&#8217;t much of a distraction &#8211; other than me noticing that the guy had the script and music score of the entire play in a binder and would be following along (though at times, he had to catch up a few pages); I do wonder if the AV guy has memorized most of it by now or is bored from seeing it over and over. My short review as posted on Facebook:<br />
<blockquote><p>Wasn&#8217;t sure it was worth seeing the Sound of Music twice, but it was different enough and surprisingly, I enjoyed Stratford&#8217;s version more than Toronto&#8217;s &#8211; the key characters were believable, and I welcomed the comic relief (Max and the &#8220;cowboys&#8221; as referenced in the review &#8211; one vignette coincided well with Oktoberfest). If you have time before the season ends, go catch it!</p>

<p>When dining out, we celebrated my sister&#8217;s birthday at Dels and treated my mom to the westernized version of pig ears (fried and savoury sweet) at Fork and Cork Grill. We also managed two lunch visits to Mikey&#8217;s and shared some deep-fried tofu (they previously liked) and introduced them to their version of iced lemon tea, beef brisket noodle soup and condensed milk HK style french toast! j.w also took everyone to SOS BBQ for his favourite in town fish and chips, Downtown Crepe Cafe for cappuccino and crepes, Seven Shores for cappuccino and café mocha (my fave place for the latter), and to breadbaron for our family favourite sandwich place (ms piggy! though porksgiving is another fav of mine too when they don&#8217;t offer ms piggy). In Mississauga, we tried to visit the recommended Grand Chinese Cuisine, but it was closed to a private wedding reception (though my mother thinks that was a good thing as we found out later that a noodle dish is regularly $18!) so we ended up at Royal Jasmine (very salty but that&#8217;s all I know near the 401) and Phoenix (not to be confused with the chain in GTA), a HK style café which had great baked pork chop on fried rice and other good ha-ng-cha dishes overall!<br />
If you&#8217;re a friend on Facebook, we&#8217;ve posted a <del>few</del> number of photos of them together.</p>
<h3>Developmental progress</h3>
<div>Bean has picked up a few sayings and mannerisms from her cousin (and vice versa) and now sings a version of Veggie Tales&#8217; &#8220;where is my hairbrush&#8221; and Sesame Street&#8217;s &#8220;brush your teeth&#8221; song and says &#8220;nope&#8221; and &#8220;yep&#8221; in addition to her usual &#8220;no&#8221; and &#8220;yeah&#8221;;&nbsp;the strangest one yet seems to be her regression in being toilet&nbsp;trained&nbsp;for&nbsp;#2. She used to tell us when she needed to go but&nbsp;a few days into their visit, she actually went in her diaper (and didn&#8217;t tell me and even when I asked, she didn&#8217;t seem bothered), and even now, she ends up with a funny look (with her poking or picking her nose?!) while on occasion with some crying. When she does acknowledge that she needs to go, and I ask her about it, she tells me she needs to pee too (which she does&#8230;which I guess&nbsp;that&#8217;s progress to a degree!)</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
 Their way of saying goodbye!

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				A few weeks ago, the main branch of the Kitchener Public Library invited Matter of Taste owners, Phong (and Dawn) Tran, to give a quick coffee-brewing workshop to a dozen or so guests. While I have experienced horrible customer service multiple times at the coffee shop itself (including with one of the owners) and have since stopped going (which saves me a bunch as we often opted to treat ourselves to Dawn&#8217;s special &#8211; the MoT pricier version of Vietnamese-style iced coffee), I commend them for crafting out time to share their insights with us.<br />
At the end of the night, I was surprised to discover that even if you use the same beans and the same weight of grind, depending on which method you use to make a cup of coffee, the end results can be so varied in look and taste. It&#8217;s also amazing how much more fragrant freshly roasted and ground coffee is! Our samples were from Ethiopia, roasted a day before and ground that evening.<br />
From my observations*:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AeroPress" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Aeropress</a>: coarser grind, paper filter, hand pressure<br />
Result: clean, no sediment, sweet after taste, dark in color, my favourite choice<br />
If you don&#8217;t have an espresso machine, you can get a cheater espresso with this device</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_press" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">French press</a> (commonly associated with the Bodum brand): coarsest grind, mesh filter &#8211; push down a bit first so grounds can soak and aerate &#8211; then let it sit for a few minutes before slowly plunging it the rest of the way<br />
Result: sediment at bottom of cup, lighter in color, similar in body/taste as Aeropress<br />
So if going for the same taste as Aeropress but want to save $ for the equipment, this would do / be a happy medium</li>
<li><a href="http://coffee.wikia.com/wiki/Pour-Over_Filtration_Brewing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pour-over</a>: paper filter &#8211; rinse with hot water first to take out chemicals in filter and to warm up the receptacle<br />
Result: Tasted more acidic (&#8220;citrusy notes&#8221; was how Phong described it). Clean, but I didn&#8217;t like the taste.</li>
</ul>
<p>Alas, I was too busy drinking up the shots, keeping mental notes and comparisons, and trying to keep up that I forgot to take photos for visual reference.<br />
*Note: Certain flavours&nbsp; may be more apparent to some and preferences may differ but the remark about different methods, different results hold true.		</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				Tomorrow marks the last day of this challenge and it sure wasn&#8217;t easy being constrained to being intentionally local, especially when others around you aren&#8217;t. The most frequently asked questions were, &#8220;<em>is this [considered] local?</em>&#8221; and &#8220;<em>why are you doing this?</em>&#8221;<br />
The second question is a bit easier to answer: aside from the <a href="http://www.baileyslocalfoods.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">free year&#8217;s membership to Baileys Local</a> and to support and participate with the community, I wanted to see if it would take a lifestyle change to live locally. With only a day to go (and $12 for cheating between the two of us, the biggest culprit for us being online entertainment like streaming and reading non-local blogs and eating), I&#8217;ve concluded that being exclusively local can be easy in some ways, but it would not work long-term for us if we had to do it day in and day out. T&#8217;was not for naught though, as we happened upon a few new discoveries along the way (<a title="#livelocalkw: Coffee &amp; The Great Outdoors" href="http://her.happyhippos.ca/2014/09/livelocalkw-coffee-the-great-outdoors/#comments" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@SKL</a> &#8211; this part is for you!): a place that sells beeswax (for my baking experiment that will hopefully happen), <a href="http://ambrosiapastry.com/about-us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a shop that sells <span class="st">canelés</span> (!)</a>, <a href="http://www.baileyslocalfoods.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">one more online option to order local/organic food</a>, and the manager that ran the sushi and sandwiches at the now-defunct Casa Mia is selling sushi (and other items) at the Y Café at the CIGI campus beside it (so not all is lost!)!<br />
In our quest to stay local this week, we discovered that not everyone defines local the way we do;&nbsp; for example, a well-intending parent tried to convince us that Ontario corn and carrots bought at a Walmart in Toronto counts as being &#8220;local&#8221;, and while Ontario-grown produce is great, Walmart is far from being local on my list, even if it had been bought at the Walmart in KW and even if Walmart employs staff that are from the city.<br />
And while there are plenty more great places around town to eat, shop, and play local, the following three ties up this blog series:</p>
<h3>Eat</h3>
<p>Generally speaking, I don&#8217;t like paying for cold sandwiches (or grapes, honeydew, cantaloupe, muffins, veggies that can be found on a veggie tray, har gow or siu mai) &#8211; this likely stems from eating deli sandwiches for lunch throughout most of primary and secondary school because our family owned a soup and sandwich restaurant and catering business (har gow, siu mai from daily dim sum lunches with the grandparents while in HK). However, I still enjoy hot sandwiches and the occasional cold ones &#8211; usually ones that don&#8217;t have deli meat in them.&nbsp;<br />
I especially like the housemade bacon-based sandwiches made at <a href="http://breadbaron.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">breadbaron</a>, a take-out stand that took over <a href="http://indulgekitchen.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Indulge Kitchen</a> at the Kitchener Market, but they cycle through a few sandwiches every so often, which makes sense as they can ensure fresh ingredients and do it well. . One perk is that after you order one sandwich, they give you a $1 off coupon to be used on a subsequent purchase there!</p>
<h3>Shop</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/Steckle/photos/a.152547468193790.30913.121778541270683/631374770311055/?type=1&amp;theater"></a> Steckle&#8217;s produce stand (Photo: Facebook)<br />
Well, since this is the last of the series, here are three other places apart from the typical supermarket chains that we buy our fridge and freezer food from:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.stecklehomestead.ca" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steckle Heritage Farm</a> when in season, sells their farm-grown veggies and root vegetables. Last year they had a novel concept where you just pay what you can or what you feel like it&#8217;s worth, but this year, they seem to have priced their harvest reasonably (and pay by honour system).&nbsp; The produce stand just sits near the entrance and is open to the public on Tuesdays between 3-7pm</li>
<li>Sustainable360.ca doesn&#8217;t require a membership fee (unlike Bailey&#8217;s) and while the selection isn&#8217;t as vast as Bailey&#8217;s, they do offer products that Bailey&#8217;s doesn&#8217;t sell and on par or cheaper than its online and in-store competitors (I&#8217;ve compared blueberries from the same farm, same volume, and it was $1 cheaper here than Bailey&#8217;s)</li>
<li>and a honorable mention to <a href="http://www.caudlescatchseafood.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Caudle&#8217;s Catch</a> &#8211; because I miss the seafood from Vancouver. Seafood isn&#8217;t local, but they do sell quality seafood, including wild-caught fish from the Great Lakes in addition to a variety of other farmed and wild fish (and other frozen and fresh seafood). While they are not swimming in a tank like Asian supermarkets, they get shipments weekly and they often look fresher than the dying fish in those tanks anyway; they will also gut and clean/scale the fish for you in store, and can cut up a whole fish for you the way you like it, if you give them a day or two notice (e.g. filets and steaks)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Play</h3>
<p>I love that our library is not just about books:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can borrow books, movies, even video games!</li>
<li>I can use our city libraries without having to leave the house. How?
<ul>
<li>The Kitchener library system lets you download unlimited e-books, magazines to keep, two songs to keep twice a month, and lets you stream movies (twice a month)</li>
<li>You can search online for an item (from both cities) and place a hold on it to be delivered to your preferred library for pick-up (but you need to return the item to a library of the city it belongs)</li>
<li>They email you when your item is ready to be picked up and when upcoming items are due back</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The beauty of our libraries is that you can get both a Kitchener and a Waterloo library card</li>
<li>Aside from parking and fines, all their services are free!</li>
<li>Programs, films, talks, including family-friendly activities</li>
<li>Media space and use of a 3D printer (limited to 3hrs a day)</li>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				One of the great things about living in Kitchener-Waterloo is that you don&#8217;t need to go far to eat, shop, or play. Perhaps it is partly because of this that one of friends can say that Waterloo isn&#8217;t about the scenery or the pretty buildings, but about the community that brings the people and the city together (I&#8217;m glad that others have come to <a title="Talent Attraction Lab" href="http://her.happyhippos.ca/2011/11/talent-attraction-lab/">this same conclusion</a>).<br />
Yesterday, the little one and I deviated from her regular routine and instead of a morning nap; we headed over to our neighbourhood community centre to play with toys and make new friends.&nbsp; Today, I participated in a free, lively workshop (hosted by Employment Ontario) about money saving ideas in and around town and was inspired by other like-minded people who have even better methods of saving money / finding a good deal (so I&#8217;m not the only crazy one out there <a href="http://bec4-beyondthepicketfence.blogspot.ca/2012/05/pallet-bench-tutorial.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">who wants to turn a palette into a furniture piece!</a> sadly, I don&#8217;t have any tools nor have I the woodworking experience).<br />
In this morning&#8217;s daily #livelocalkw email, we were asked, <em>how do you feel about your community when you eat, shop, and play local?</em>&nbsp; Aside from being able to support the livelihood of those in the community, by being intentional, the faces around you eventually become people you know instead of strangers who you may only interact with once or twice (or maybe not&nbsp; at all for those transactions done over a screen).<br />
Today&#8217;s picks:</p>
<h3>Eat</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/aromacafewaterloo/photos/a.215748145251734.1073741828.174792352680647/284505125042702/?type=1&amp;theater"></a> Aroma Cafe&#8217;s Bibimbap (Photo: Aroma Cafe, Facebook)<br />
Uptown Waterloo&#8217;s <a href="https://www.facebook.com/aromacafewaterloo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Aroma Café</a>, <em>not</em> to be confused with the Toronto-based Aroma Espresso Bar franchise chain, is a small coffee shop that is tucked away in the upstairs of the building beside Angie&#8217;s Kitchen. But don&#8217;t think that it&#8217;s just another &#8220;coffee&#8221; shop; Kiki, the owner, is super-friendly and aside from making their own blends of coffee beans (which they discount off every few days to keep their supply fresh), I love that she puts her own twist in traditional Korean bibimbap, using atypical ingredients like beets, turnip, avocado, and alfalfa sprouts so that the dish tastes super fresh and is full of &#8220;gourmet&#8221; vegetables. I&#8217;ve concluded that any of her Korean-style takes are simply delicious, because her rice cakes and kalbi pockets were tasty too.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Shop</h3>
<p>One of our regular weekly destinations to shop on Saturdays is the Kitchener Market. We go to get locally grown vegetables, eggs, and other good (non-local) deals. We also find that the average price at this market cheaper than the one in St. Jacob&#8217;s, perhaps it is because it feels less touristy and has fewer vendors. Like the St. Jacob&#8217;s market, many vendors will also mark down their fresh food to clear their stock by the end of the day (10 minutes prior closing, which is around 2pm).</p>
<h3>Play</h3>
<p>Community associations/centres and recreation complexes provide quality programs at affordable prices; for instance, the caregiver + tot drop-in down the street from us costs $1 each time we go.&nbsp; Depending on the community association, you can find a range of offerings, from fitness and sports like <a href="http://www.kitchener.ca/en/livinginkitchener/Lyle_Hallman_Walking_Track.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">indoor running tracks</a> (free!), badminton and ballroom dancing to art and cooking classes. Our neighbourhood association even throws a yearly party for the community, bringing live entertainment, music, and bouncy castles!<br />
Even if you&#8217;re not participating this challenge, how do <em>you</em> feel when you eat, shop, or play local?		</p>
