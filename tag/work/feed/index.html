								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				This spring has certainly sprung some surprises, some better than others:</p>
<h2>Ralph S. Mouse (the S stands for smart)</h2>
<p>Let&#8217;s begin with a story of the mouse. If you have followed my stories for some years now, you might recall <a href="https://her.happyhippos.ca/2008/04/mouse-in-house/">the story of j.w catching a live mouse with a waste basket</a>. I was hoping it was a one-time incident; instead, I found myself mentioning to j.w that I saw a grey blob scurrying near the baseboardÂ on the kitchen floor as I was chatting with j.wu after small group one night. j.w investigated and found some droppings in the corner of our kitchen floor! We eventually found a few favourite places it liked to hide when we saw signs of it: particularly behind the bookcase in the basement and behind/in the stove; and, I had accidentally discovered where it likely came from: the range hood vent. I only know this because I went into the cupboard above the stove and found the silicon sleeve on our coffee carafe broken. My first thought? How cheap! And then, one of us realized it had been chewed through. Lo and behold, there was a bunch of droppings all over the cupboard, which of course I had missed because of my height. Who knows how long it&#8217;s been living among us!<br />
So, the cat and mouse game began. First, the live traps were placed, but they consistently turned up empty, and there was no sign of a mouse anywhere; it seemed that even the food crumbs from our children&#8217;s messy eating habitsÂ were ignored. Until. I found a bun stuck between where the oven vents out into the stove a couple of weeks later. I was baffled at how it got there as I had thrown it out into the green bin bag myself; then I realized that the mouse must have tried to sneak it into its hiding place by going through the oven vents and because the bun was so big, it jammed!! Well, within 24 hours of placing the snap trap that PT recommended, it caught it. And, there hasn&#8217;t been a mouse indoors since.Â  And now, the little ants have returned (they get into the house every spring for a few weeks until the powder keeps them away); oddly [ref] it&#8217;s odd because she&#8217;s afraid of bugs in general, like spiders [/ref], Bean says she likes them and even have picked up a few to watch them crawl on her hands.</p>
<hr />
<h2>120 km/h wind storm</h2>
<p>If a trees falls in a forest, does it make a sound? It certainly makes a big splash.<br />
Then there was the ice storm and the wind storm, followed by some wicked summer weather (30C plus). The ice storm wasn&#8217;t much of an ice storm compared to the earlier ones, but the wind storm knocked down many trees. I happened to be sitting on the couch looking out into the forest and saw a giant tree fall into the bog &#8211; it was quite the splash. Our loose fascia ripped off and it&#8217;s missing &#8211; but we discovered that it was loose in the first place because annoying wasps had made a nest under it a while back. But, we were the fortunate ones, roofing and other repair companies are at capacity for the next month or so because some other houses had batches of shingles and even the siding at the side of the house stripped off from the wind! I still see big trees on the ground or on wooden fences around the neighbourhoods we drive by.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Team dynamics</h2>
<p>I&#8217;m approaching 6 months, and a new office! Within the last few months, I&#8217;ve discovered some interesting stats about the makeup of our current team; our newest hire will change it but until then:<br />
<iframe title="Educate Kids Charity Infographic" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" src="https://www.canva.com/design/DAC5ExYkm3A/view?embed&#038;meta#?secret=b0a4gAZx95" data-secret="b0a4gAZx95" height="960" width="366"></iframe></p>
<hr />
<h2>Nose injuries</h2>
<p>Well, since our mild hand-foot-mouth incident with our little guy (&#8220;diagnosed by Google&#8221; when we noticed that his fingernails were peeling a few weeks following rash symptoms), he&#8217;s had a couple of accidents:</p>
<ol>
<li>He fell from the steps ontoÂ his nose. Thankfully, it was a superficial injury, so it healed up relatively quickly. Now we can say that they both have fallen down the stairs at the same age (she rolled down a whole flight from what I could tell and sustained carpet burn injuries)</li>
<li>A few weeks later, after it healed, he falls from a trike onto the gym floor and onÂ his nose again. His nose was bleeding off and on for a day, so we took him to the doctor before a trip, just to make sure he was okay. Thankfully, he was fine (and no concussions either as they don&#8217;t wear helmets inside)!</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<h2>The better surprises</h2>
<p>Two visits &#8211; the highlights!</p>
<ol>
<li>A lovely visit from a friend and her family from Hong Kong, whom I haven&#8217;t seen in a few years <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="ðŸ™‚" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></li>
<li>A last-minute trip to Orlando (again) for almost a week &#8211; a separate post will followÂ  since we skipped all theme parks this time around!</li>
</ol>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				That&#8217;s our office cat in the photo. I&#8217;m one month in. And yet, it feels like a lot longer than that. I&#8217;ve found a rhythm that works with this new routine, and I&#8217;m thankful that both our kids have adjusted well too. Consequently, we transitioned our oldest to full day kindergarten, and after some trial and error, we dropped her afternoon nap, we eat dinner earlier, and they go to sleep earlier. Unfortunately, our youngest still wakes up at night and asks for food then, but our oldest seems to fall asleep faster and stays asleep throughout the night for the most part. This week has been one of the few germ-free weeks this year, so it&#8217;s a nice relief to not have to deal with that (if it wasn&#8217;t him, it was her, and if it wasn&#8217;t either of them, it was us or our daycare) &#8211; I&#8217;m grateful that our workplaces are pretty flexible when it comes from work from home policies and taking time off / emergency days, so we pretty took turns staying home with one child or both children. How do working families who don&#8217;t have backup plans / caregivers manage?<br />
At the beginning, it sort of felt like I was starting at a new school in the middle of the school year; I had a lot to learn and a lot of faces and names to remember. I still have a lot to learn and faces and names to remember, but it feels like I&#8217;m making an impact. I&#8217;m also thankful that I enjoy my work, so it&#8217;s easy to wake up earlier and rush out the door.<br />
We will have to find a different routine come summer, but so far, it&#8217;s been working out just perfectly. I&#8217;m glad I scaled back my hours (before signing the offer) because it turns out if you&#8217;re driving a car for school pick-up, you pretty much have to arrive in the neighbourhood at least 20 minutes early in order to find available street parking around the perimeter of the school; otherwise, you&#8217;re pretty much out of luck. And even though I get off at 2:30PM, by the time I get everyone home, it&#8217;s 4PM. I then give them a small snack, work on unloading the dishwasher and getting another load in, and starting supper. By the time we are done dinner, it&#8217;s close to 7PM, and we play a bit then bathe (if applicable), and then off to bed. After that, I clean up the kitchen (pack food away, prep lunches) and maybe wash or fold the laundry. I&#8217;ve been doing laundry on weekends in loads, so I can just sit and binge-watch Netflix (working through The Crown) while folding.<br />
Surprisingly, I find myself dozing off before midnight and using the computer less after work (but still on my phone) &#8211; maybe it&#8217;s because I no longer have mid-day naps or work is more tiring than staying at home (though I feel it&#8217;s a break / nice change from home life). I&#8217;m on a modified work week, and I&#8217;m already wondering how full-time working parents do this every day and survive? I applaud those families!<br />
Other than work and school, we started going to a different small group / life group, which has changed to an earlier start time, which means for the first time in a long time, we actually get to stay past dinner. We have also started going to another church, primarily because Bean is at an age where she is learning, and I simply can&#8217;t go on teaching her every week &#8211; and when I don&#8217;t, I hear implied comments about going to a different church anyway. I&#8217;m a little sad, but since I also miss fellowship time because I&#8217;m watching them after service is over while everyone else is chatting and because people don&#8217;t tend to eat together for lunch as much anymore, I&#8217;m not really connecting with anyone either. I know Bean misses it because on occasion, she tells me she wants to go back to Simply, or that she wants me to be her teacher that day, and every time we pass by St. Paul&#8217;s, she points out that it&#8217;s our church. Finding a new church to call home is hard. Personally, I don&#8217;t like the format of the sermons by the lead pastor at this new church so far (grossly paraphrased: partial verses are taken from different translations to fit into the sermon&#8217;s points) though the supporting pastor actually goes into a passage in contrast, but the kids seem to have adjusted so well even at the first visit and a lot of effort is put into the children&#8217;s spiritual wellbeing and education. So yes, 2018 is going to be a year of change and adjustment.</p>
<hr />
Two years ago, we were celebrating <a href="http://her.happyhippos.ca/2016/02/two-month-milestones/">two month milestones</a>. Now, at 2, he&#8217;s come a long way:</p>
<ul>
<li>Speaks in complete sentences. Has started to communicate (and copy) in English. Boo.</li>
<li>Enjoys climbing and doing crazy things and will deliberately test boundaries with people in authority (me &#8211; he&#8217;s heavy so I can&#8217;t just pick him up and grab him while grocery shopping for example, so I don&#8217;t go when I&#8217;m on my own as it&#8217;s impossible to get more than one or two things in one trip)</li>
<li>Loves to sing, and can sing many songs in English including the Alphabet song, Twinkle Twinkle Little Star, Away in the Manger, Roly Poly and can sing along with or recognize songs by Walk Off the Earth, Moana, and Frozen.</li>
<li>Loves trains, especially Thomas. And cars. And airplanes. Prefers trains though, if given a choice.</li>
<li>Easily sucked in by technology: photos on the phone, TV, iPad game, and YouTube videos. One time early on, the caregiver gave an older child a tablet to use while the younger ones were supposed to nap; he had a meltdown and refused to sleep. Then she figured out why (we had warned her prior so she made the connection and no more problems since).</li>
<li>Has not completely weaned. So, I&#8217;m still off dairy and some nuts. Nuts!</li>
<li>While he started off with liking meat, he doesn&#8217;t seem to like meat (fish the exception) as much anymore, unless it&#8217;s chicken nuggets/fingers/crispy. He will still eat it but when it is in chunks, he tends to pick it out. He also doesn&#8217;t like green fiber veggies, but will repeatedly down it in smoothie form. Like his sister, he loves fruit. Avocados, bananas, and cereal with alternative milk are now his favourite breakfast foods. He is a soup and rice monster. Sometimes noodles too.</li>
<li>Self-toilet training is hit and miss so far &#8211; and if successful, it&#8217;s still only #2 (though a few times, he wakes up with a dry diaper and will go if you put him on the toilet); progress seems to have slowed down or regressed especially now that he doesn&#8217;t tell his caregiver he needs to go (or maybe she hasn&#8217;t learned the signs yet)</li>
<li>He may have had a mini <a href="http://her.happyhippos.ca/2017/04/the-day-we-had-our-first-ambulance-ride/">febrile seizure</a> the other week, when he had a slight fever (while fighting off strange rashes &#8211; maybe mild symptoms of hand, foot, mouth + reaction to lactose in Tylenol) but it lasted no more than a few seconds and it was in his sleep.</li>
<li>He seems interested in people he knows (and babies) &#8211; often willing to share a toy, asking for someone by name, offering hugs to those he loves (except it&#8217;s sad to see hugs not reciprocated, especially when his sister comes out from dance class and he goes to hug her and she brushes him off; however, she always asks to go into timeout with him when he&#8217;s in trouble), and enjoys helping out in the kitchen (putting dishes away, watching and helping mommy cook/bake)</li>
<li>He must have shorter legs or something, because he fits his age in tops when it comes to sizing but his bottoms are behind a bit.</li>
</ul>
<p>I&#8217;m amazed at how fast our children is growing up, now that we all have slightly different routines and that they are no longer babies.		</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				If you had asked me at the beginning of this year, or even at the beginning of last month where I&#8217;d be by the end of the year, I would have said, &#8220;same old&#8221;; yet, 2017, turned out to be quite the year of the new and unexpected:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://her.happyhippos.ca/2017/01/we-are-one-of-those-families/">Confirmed allergies; dietary changes</a></li>
<li><a href="http://her.happyhippos.ca/2017/04/the-day-we-had-our-first-ambulance-ride/">Seizure scare resulting in a trip to the hospital via ambulance</a></li>
<li><a href="http://her.happyhippos.ca/2017/07/first-solo-trip-with-two/">Travelling as a solo-parent with two</a> to Vancouver, then hosting my sister who travelled as a solo-parent with two</li>
<li>Getting Ready for School programs and <a href="http://her.happyhippos.ca/2017/09/kindergarten-101/">starting school</a> meant a change in routines and expectations</li>
<li><a href="http://her.happyhippos.ca/2017/12/maui-back-in-time/">Vacationing in Mau</a>i and then <a href="http://her.happyhippos.ca/2017/12/orlando-with-young-kids/">in Orlando</a></li>
<li>Ending the year as a stay-at-home mom and transitioning to a working mom in 2018!</li>
</ul>
<p>Being a stay-at-home mom was God&#8217;s gift: I see it as being paid to leave at the end of my first maternity leave. This upcoming job? Also God&#8217;s gift &#8211; here&#8217;s why:</p>
<ul>
<li>I had not been actively applying for jobs [ref]I had actually resigned to giving up my career (I&#8217;ve labelled it &#8220;career suicide&#8221;) and had expected to stay at home until the youngest was at school at minimum, and then finding part-time or casual work during school hours, probably in a different field[/ref]. Once or twice a year, I get asked and consider going back to work but I&#8217;ve always declined due to the number of hours (I didn&#8217;t want a 40 hour work week; I want to be home when the kids are off school) but the past few months have been a perfect set-up for this&#8230;</li>
<li>I had not been actively applying for jobs. Yet, in the spring, a friend asked me if I was interested in doing consulting work for them; it was ideal: part-time hours, mostly at night after kids&#8217; bedtimes, and my in-laws gave us childcare support during the few on-site visits! Turns out, recent work became relevant work.</li>
<li>When our oldest started school, our youngest lost his playing companion and he suddenly demanded more of my attention (ie. companionship); he also wanted to go out, just like his sister did. So, I turned to the <a href="https://www.sapcrc.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Parent-Child Resource Center at our local Salvation Army</a>, and enrolled in programs three days a week, so that he would have something to do in the mornings. They were (are) amazing: my in-laws&#8217; church nursery couldn&#8217;t calm him down but they did within a short time on the first day, though it took him 3 weeks to stop crying at drop-off and pick-up. Now, even though he initially protests, I know he can be happy in someone else&#8217;s care.</li>
<li>Timing: I have been picking up a friend&#8217;s daughter from Montessori and dropping her off at the sitter once a week, but it just happens that the mom&#8217;s schedule is changing in January, so I don&#8217;t have to do that anymore.</li>
<li>I had not been actively applying for jobs. Somehow, between Maui to Orlando (within a month), I was offered a job.</li>
<li>I had not been actively applying for jobs. I hadn&#8217;t interviewed for at least 7 years, so I&#8217;m not exactly well-practised. I went through a few rounds of interviews, and by the second round, I actually expected to walk away for good, as my interview ended early; I felt that I could have given better answers (instead of what I felt were vague) and I did not complete a 20-minute design challenge in time or thoroughly (what happened to navigation?!). I also didn&#8217;t have a portfolio ready until interviews started!</li>
<li>I had not been actively applying for jobs. Yet, this company had an opening for a permanent position (advertised) &#8211; doing what I enjoy &#8211; at reduced hours (unadvertised), which lets me get off in time to pick up the kids from school &#8211; how awesome is that?!</li>
<li>Interesting tidbit: my first job was at a GIS company with under 50 employees; this job is at a GIS company with about the same number.</li>
</ul>
<p>We just need to find childcare now, but if God has provided all of this, I&#8217;m certain we will be in good hands!		</p>
