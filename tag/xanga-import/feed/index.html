								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				I had dropped into some shops and boutiques on the street, but each shop was a standalone. Went into one asking about whether one had seen some crime in the neighbourhood, and she commented on something and mentioned that NNUptown next door (which for some reason was also a detached one) closed early for the day. I had wanted to see if they had all been hit too. Someone near the neighbour had given me a punch, which had resulted in a bruised eye. Eventually, I ended up in a building, where the culprit was, and was just chatting with him (to get him to admit his crime) at a safe distance before the police came to arrest him. He reminded me of Jamie S (and maybe was). Apparently, he had a moment of insanity and had killed someone. The police had been convinced that he had done some other related crimes and had done it with intent. But from my conversation with him, it didn&#8217;t seem that way. </p>
<p>So, I persuaded them to let me talk to him at the custody jail, with me wired. Going in, I ended up speaking with the front desk in Cantonese, so others didn&#8217;t know I was wired. I was also allowed in with my BlackBerry, so I was able to record the conversation (for my records in case the police decided to snip pieces of the conversation). Yes, he admitted to one crime on an act of impulse, but no, it didn&#8217;t seem like he was capable of the others. He also wasn&#8217;t the guy who punched me in the face or doing some of the crimes in the area.		</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				Armageddon<br />
I recall a scene where we distinctly knew that it was the end times and Christ had returned. Someone asked me why I didn&#8217;t tell him about it earlier, but I told him that I had tried to tell me, but for naught. Oddly enough, those who knew Him were allowed entry into a room, while the rest stayed outside. Still strangely enough, many people were Asians and from NT. Our comission was now that Christ returned, we were given a second chance to share the good news &#8211; hopefully that those who saw would believe.</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>Last night, perhaps from overhearding the news of the Costa cruise ship sinking, I dreamed that we were on a ship and were practicing the emergency evacation drill, in real life. We had to get our life jackets, and actually had to jump from the ship into the frigid water. I didn&#8217;t really want to do it, knowing that I couldn&#8217;t swim, so I thought about not going through with the drill. But, my sister (who also can&#8217;t swim), was calm and at peace about it. I prayed for the same peace and stood in line behind her. After I jumped and the ship was evacuated, we learned that the drill was actually real; the captain had known that the ship was sinking, so he decided to call the drill [maybe to prevent the chaos?].</p>
<p>So, I woke up to Google more about the tragic story about Costa Concordia to find out more details and what happened.		</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				I remember seeing a old classmate, Randy Park, from elementary school performing in a (Christian?) band&#8230;and then afterwards, tried to find them to say hello.<br />
Someone was with me and we even attempted to take the public transit to see if we could catch them. Anyway, shortly after this person remarked that he was disappointed that Randy wasn&#8217;t in the band anymore, but instead was working for the US government; his face even showed on the website. I had the feeling that his disappointment was not in the area of work, but in terms of outreach in the workplace.<br />
Somehow, I had was sitting in a room with a bunch of PR folks waiting for the president to give a speech and DID actually bumped into Randy. And I had the impression that he was doing meaningful work. As we were catching up, Mr. President Obama came in (and yes, the audience actually greeted him as &#8220;Mr. President&#8221;), with his wife.<br />
(woohoo, not only do I bump into old friends in my dreams, I bump into Obama as well).		</p>

zc had a son, but strangely enough it wasn&#8217;t through his wife (made it seem like his wife couldn&#8217;t so she was okay to use a surrogate mother, which was oddly someone they both knew);<br />
jas gave birth to a baby girl and even though it was her first, labour was within 4 hours!<br />
and i was with mel33 when she came to me and her devastated look on her face told me that she had just lost her baby (miscarried) &#8211; i guess she must have seen abnormal fluid like blood. i&#8217;m not sure where m was, but in my mind, i was wondering if we needed to go to the hospital to get her checked out.		</p>

				<description><![CDATA[We were following a map, somewhat like Google, that took us to our vacationing destination (a chalet/cottage at the edge of the lake). When we arrived, it was almost exactly like the map: a row of cottages on the edge of the lake, but with two houses swapped. So, I decided to take a picture: a shot of the map against the real scene, and snapped a quick photo on my BlackBerry camera &#8211; with my sister unpacking off the side, and the mountains in the background.

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				We were following a map, somewhat like Google, that took us to our vacationing destination (a chalet/cottage at the edge of the lake). When we arrived, it was almost exactly like the map: a row of cottages on the edge of the lake, but with two houses swapped. So, I decided to take a picture: a shot of the map against the real scene, and snapped a quick photo on my BlackBerry camera &#8211; with my sister unpacking off the side, and the mountains in the background.<br />
Upon going inside, I discovered that my cousin, Iris&#8217; family was already there. I went into the kitchen, and almost said hi to them, and someone who looked like my uncle. But since I knew that couldn&#8217;t have been my uncle (he passed away in September), I just offered a generic hello. Turns out that it was some other random guests (friends of a church or something?). We went to pick a room on the 2nd floor &#8211; and our family managed to find rooms in the same area, sharing the floor with Matt. And one bathroom.<br />
For some reason, as we got talking, it sounded that the term &#8220;cottage&#8221; wasn&#8217;t a common thing for Americans&#8230;and in a conversation with Iris later, she commented that the bathrooms, save one, were all shared bathrooms (that each one at individual toilet and shower stalls). And when I asked where her and her mother were staying, it turns out that they chose a room upstairs, sharing bunks with some others.		</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				The story doesn&#8217;t start here, but in one scene, I remember riding in a car with my sister on our way to what felt like a piano lesson.<br />
She stopped at a gas station (Esso?) to fill up and I looked back to see a car with Mols, Z, Wron, Teck, Brassman327, and my cousin May with them in a car. I said hello, ignored Z but gave a hug to Wron and Brassman who I hadn&#8217;t seen in awhile, and asked May what she was doing there. Turns out she had went with them to go someplace, and showed me a new set of snowboarding boots.<br />
By the time we left, Brassman actually came with my sister and I and we got chatting in the car. I told him that it felt like deja vu because a couple days ago, at the gas station, I saw Z at the same place, but with Pork, Dan, and some guy named Brian that I didn&#8217;t know in his car. I wondered why Brassman was coming with us, and it turned out that he lived in Surrey, by the Galleria, and my sister had decided that since we would be going by that area, we&#8217;d drop him off on our way, so Z wouldn&#8217;t have to (so that&#8217;s why Z was in Surrey w the gang).<br />
I told them that because I&#8217;ve been away, time freezes for me, even in my dreams, where I last remember. I told him that I sometimes still think that him and Trunkit are still in Ottawa, or in Burnaby. Come to think of it, in my mind I wondered where Trunkit, Wron, or Z&#8217;s wife were but I didn&#8217;t ask. I did mention that Teck didn&#8217;t seem to recognize or remember me, but Brasman reminded me (and I knew) that his memory was impacted by his accident. So, we took Brassman home. I thought it odd that he showered at a hospital-looking facility and then was even more surprised when my sister and another friend with the help of a nurseof his put him to bed in the next room. We left the room and I was just in pure shock, and saddened why no one told me about his condition (leukemia or some sort of potentially terminal illness). My sister went on, and I just ended up talking to his friend wondering out loud what happened, when he called us in and had us read from a Catholic book and sing to him. I thought it odd since he hasn&#8217;t ever been into any religion, but maybe he had found faith during his time here. Holding back my tears, I did and was too comforted. I guess I was going to be late for this piano lesson, but I could visit again next time.		</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				In a store, shopping for clothing and apparel. Saw a pair of (tall) boots that seemed very stylish. My mother was with me and the retailer tried to convince us that it was made of leather. This all in Cantonese. However, I told her that it didn&#8217;t smell like leather so we won&#8217;t get it. Also saw these pink pom pom extensions, where you can attach it to any hoodie and look like you have two pompoms at the end of your strings (on the hoodie string).<br />
As we walked out the store, saw some Valentine&#8217;s Day assortment of cards, stickers, and other variety of things on sale, but we remarked that if we had wanted it, it would&#8217;ve been better if we bought it a few weeks earlier, when it wasn&#8217;t close to Valentine&#8217;s day, as it was 30% off then.<br />
&#8212;<br />
Next day, met two older Japanese ladies. They didn&#8217;t know English, but surprisingly, they knew Cantonese!<br />
&#8212;<br />
Oh, and in one of these dreams, I was very shocked to discover that my friend Henry had chosen to marry another woman (while still married to his first wife)! I was trying to fight for his first wife, who seemed resigned to the fact that this was happening. I was trying to convince him that this isn&#8217;t what Christianity teaches&#8230;but it appeared that his version of faith didn&#8217;t convict him otherwise.<br />
&#8212;<br />
There was a fire. It was on the 2nd floor and people on the balcony ended up jumping down.  My friend jamesclau jumped first, and he didn&#8217;t break any bones or die, despite landing on his side (on his arm). So, we all jumped after.		</p>

I hadn&#8217;t seen them in a very long time, but when I did see Trunkit, I was very saddened to hear that she and Brassman327 had a falling out, and that they ended up becoming divorced. It turned out that ever since I seen them in Ottawa, things got worse and worse. Even sadder was that everyone stopped talking to Brassman327 &#8211; at least from the girls&#8217; perspective. Poor him.</p>

I went out, intended to go farther, but because I was running short on time, I decided to sign up for a play. Actually, there were only 8 people who did &#8211; 4 girls, and 4 guys. When I bought the pass, which were bought from people in costumes, I didn&#8217;t realize that this was for an interactive play. That meant that you were paired with one person of the opposite gender and you actively participated in an improvised play. Each participant was given a story, with lines that the characters need to achieve. For example, the first objective could be: wake up and make breakfast. In the play, you and your partner would say lines and do things on the set to get to that scene before being able to advance to the next objective. In the end, the play would finish when you got to the end of the objectives. So you get to see the story as well as participate in the plot line. And, as much as I don&#8217;t like performing publicly (despite me enjoying it very much as a child), it was a really fun experience and a very good idea&#8230;		</p>
