								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				If you had asked me at the beginning of this year, or even at the beginning of last month where I&#8217;d be by the end of the year, I would have said, &#8220;same old&#8221;; yet, 2017, turned out to be quite the year of the new and unexpected:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://her.happyhippos.ca/2017/01/we-are-one-of-those-families/">Confirmed allergies; dietary changes</a></li>
<li><a href="http://her.happyhippos.ca/2017/04/the-day-we-had-our-first-ambulance-ride/">Seizure scare resulting in a trip to the hospital via ambulance</a></li>
<li><a href="http://her.happyhippos.ca/2017/07/first-solo-trip-with-two/">Travelling as a solo-parent with two</a> to Vancouver, then hosting my sister who travelled as a solo-parent with two</li>
<li>Getting Ready for School programs and <a href="http://her.happyhippos.ca/2017/09/kindergarten-101/">starting school</a> meant a change in routines and expectations</li>
<li><a href="http://her.happyhippos.ca/2017/12/maui-back-in-time/">Vacationing in Mau</a>i and then <a href="http://her.happyhippos.ca/2017/12/orlando-with-young-kids/">in Orlando</a></li>
<li>Ending the year as a stay-at-home mom and transitioning to a working mom in 2018!</li>
</ul>
<p>Being a stay-at-home mom was God&#8217;s gift: I see it as being paid to leave at the end of my first maternity leave. This upcoming job? Also God&#8217;s gift &#8211; here&#8217;s why:</p>
<ul>
<li>I had not been actively applying for jobs [ref]I had actually resigned to giving up my career (I&#8217;ve labelled it &#8220;career suicide&#8221;) and had expected to stay at home until the youngest was at school at minimum, and then finding part-time or casual work during school hours, probably in a different field[/ref]. Once or twice a year, I get asked and consider going back to work but I&#8217;ve always declined due to the number of hours (I didn&#8217;t want a 40 hour work week; I want to be home when the kids are off school) but the past few months have been a perfect set-up for this&#8230;</li>
<li>I had not been actively applying for jobs. Yet, in the spring, a friend asked me if I was interested in doing consulting work for them; it was ideal: part-time hours, mostly at night after kids&#8217; bedtimes, and my in-laws gave us childcare support during the few on-site visits! Turns out, recent work became relevant work.</li>
<li>When our oldest started school, our youngest lost his playing companion and he suddenly demanded more of my attention (ie. companionship); he also wanted to go out, just like his sister did. So, I turned to the <a href="https://www.sapcrc.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Parent-Child Resource Center at our local Salvation Army</a>, and enrolled in programs three days a week, so that he would have something to do in the mornings. They were (are) amazing: my in-laws&#8217; church nursery couldn&#8217;t calm him down but they did within a short time on the first day, though it took him 3 weeks to stop crying at drop-off and pick-up. Now, even though he initially protests, I know he can be happy in someone else&#8217;s care.</li>
<li>Timing: I have been picking up a friend&#8217;s daughter from Montessori and dropping her off at the sitter once a week, but it just happens that the mom&#8217;s schedule is changing in January, so I don&#8217;t have to do that anymore.</li>
<li>I had not been actively applying for jobs. Somehow, between Maui to Orlando (within a month), I was offered a job.</li>
<li>I had not been actively applying for jobs. I hadn&#8217;t interviewed for at least 7 years, so I&#8217;m not exactly well-practised. I went through a few rounds of interviews, and by the second round, I actually expected to walk away for good, as my interview ended early; I felt that I could have given better answers (instead of what I felt were vague) and I did not complete a 20-minute design challenge in time or thoroughly (what happened to navigation?!). I also didn&#8217;t have a portfolio ready until interviews started!</li>
<li>I had not been actively applying for jobs. Yet, this company had an opening for a permanent position (advertised) &#8211; doing what I enjoy &#8211; at reduced hours (unadvertised), which lets me get off in time to pick up the kids from school &#8211; how awesome is that?!</li>
<li>Interesting tidbit: my first job was at a GIS company with under 50 employees; this job is at a GIS company with about the same number.</li>
</ul>
<p>We just need to find childcare now, but if God has provided all of this, I&#8217;m certain we will be in good hands!		</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				And, I hope it will be our last, and I hope this will the first and last time I have to call 911 for an emergency response. Come to think of it, that was his first time at a hospital too, since he was <a href="http://her.happyhippos.ca/2015/12/its-another-baby/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">born at home</a>.<br />
A couple of evenings ago, our little one had a <a href="http://kidshealth.org/en/parents/febrile.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">febrile seizure</a>. I didn&#8217;t know that was the name of it at the time, but I had two fleeting thoughts: &#8211; what was it that I read about seizures in young children during illness &#8211; was this it or something else? and &#8211; I hope I don&#8217;t have to ask for our hand-me-down baby clothes back. During the episode, I felt so helpless watching his limbs twitch, his eyes roll back repeatedly, and his lips turn blue. Shortly after we laid him down on the floor, during the call with dispatch, the seizure stopped but his eyes looked glassy, his gaze off in the distance; he fell asleep despite us talking to him and he didn&#8217;t even notice his sister jumping to get his attention. I cheered inside every time his chest rose up and then down, confirming that he was still breathing.<br />
And for those wondering:</p>
<h3>What was the ambulance ride like?</h3>
<p>The inside of an ambulance is surprisingly spacious, with ample room to seat at least 5 passengers with seat belts, and there&#8217;s a <a href="http://www.fernoems.com/en/search-results/pedi-mate.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">child-restraint system</a> for ambulance cots! Though, with rather limited windows and with the small view whizzing by when I tried to look out to see whether we were, I found myself getting a bit motion sick. We were the first call on their shift. As the ambulance door closed, I could only offer a weak smile to the neighbour who walked out to see what was going on (I found out later, they asked j.w if everything was okay and invited them over and offered to babysit if needed). If the $45 ambulance bill is not covered by OHIP or extended health, it&#8217;s a fairly reasonable cost: $755 cheaper than having a fire truck come on scene, and $35 cheaper than for one in our area in BC.</p>
<h3>What happened at the hospital?</h3>
<p>We were placed in our own room with a bed to rest on in the acute care department of the emergency ward  &#8211; I guess that&#8217;s one advantage of arriving via ambulance: <a href="http://www.grhosp.on.ca/care/services-departments/emergency/current-emergency-wait" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">you don&#8217;t have to sit in the waiting area</a> and deal with triage directly. His temperature was noted at 38.8C (which isn&#8217;t the highest it&#8217;s been). One of the paramedics instructed me to put him on the bed and wanted me to stand or sit in the chair, but thankfully, the nurses let me pick him up, which calmed him down (and kept him from falling off the bed!). For the most part, he wasn&#8217;t too miserable &#8211; I mean, you&#8217;d feel uncomfortable and probably want to cry too if they poked you, put you in some confining <a href="http://www.piggostat.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">x-ray contraption</a>, and put a catheter in you. The blood work showed low bicarbonate which may be related to his crazy <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f4a9.png" alt="💩" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> episodes in the past couple of days (diarrhea, the doctor thinks), and chest X-rays suggest something viral in the chest, possibly early pneumonia, which might have been from his cold a couple weeks back and could explain the wet cough they overheard. The doctor consulted the pediatrician and decided that no antibiotics were needed at this time since he&#8217;s still himself, for the most part anyway (thankfully because antibiotics can cause a bunch of side effects including yeast infection in the diaper area &#8211; but I&#8217;ve supplemented with probiotics anyway since he had diarrhea). Pee dip test came out clear. Overall, we had a nice mother-son bonding time once I was given the okay to pick him up and hold him.<br />
Despite us having to wait 5 hours for tests and results to come back, and with little updates unless I asked, towards the end of the evening, a nurse held my son while she faced the other way in the washroom so I could relieve my relatively full bladder, and even gave me a sandwich, some juice, and some fruit for us to eat, when I asked where I could buy some food to fill our rather empty stomachs (the little guy promptly fell asleep once he satisfied his hunger)[ref]this episode happened just as we were sitting down to eat dinner so we missed it[/ref].<br />
Towards the later parts of the evening, one distressed and very vocal fellow ended up in the same ward as us. One of the nurses told me that on weekends/Saturdays especially, and during later parts of the night, they often see people who don&#8217;t know where they are, or are elsewhere mentally because they&#8217;re either drunk or on way too much drugs, and sadly, the many of the latter are young people.<br />
PT took us home as it was late by the time we left and j.w had stayed home with Bean. Since then, DS has symptoms of a cold in addition to the fever, which comes and goes.<br />
Overall, I am very pleased with the response rate and care that we received the other night by Grand River hospital and by the paramedics.</p>
<h3>What are we to watch for now?</h3>
<p>The doctor instructed me to bring him back if he had another seizure within 24 hours, if we see him have any difficulty breathing, or if the fever doesn&#8217;t dissipate within 5 days. I was also advised to make a follow-up appointment with our family doctor the next week. If we notice less wet diapers, she suggested 1:1 apple juice to water ratio as a cheaper and tastier but equally effective alternative to pedialyte.</p>
<h3>Will it happen again? Does it affect their development? Will they get epilepsy?</h3>
<p>Sadly, the chances of another febrile seizure happening in the future is 1 in 3 (33%) now that he has had one. Both the internet and the doctor tells me that it&#8217;s fairly common in young children in response to a fever past 38C and it doesn&#8217;t seem to harm them. Our relatively laid-back child now has both allergy and febrile seizure risks (to balance out his easy-going nature?).  His chance of developing epilepsy according to the doctor is double, moving from 1% to 2%, which is still quite low: it won&#8217;t happen 98% of the time.</p>
<h3>What happened before all this started?</h3>
<p>Before the seizure, he seemed like his usual self, though he has seemed sad after every time he soiled his diaper for the past day or so (every one was was poopy) especially when I asked him about it, and he vomited once while crying on the toilet (I thought it was from crying, not from being sick). He hadn&#8217;t quite shaken his cough from a couple weeks back, but it didn&#8217;t seem to bother him and it was only on occasion, so I thought it was just residual coughing. He was maybe a touch warmer than usual, but I&#8217;m usually able to tell if he has a fever just by feel, so I&#8217;m not sure why I didn&#8217;t notice it; it probably didn&#8217;t help that he was wearing a wool cardigan. He woke up from his late nap after being transferred to j.w so I could make dinner, and shortly after j.w put him in the high chair, I heard, &#8220;I think he&#8217;s having a seizure&#8221;. I suggested moving him onto the ground (which the doctor assured me that was the right thing to do), called 911 since it was his first time and we weren&#8217;t sure what to do &#8211; I figured I could use the verbal coaching if I needed to do infant/baby/child CPR. He definitely felt and looked a lot hotter by the time the seizure stopped and woke up crying.</p>
<h3>What to expect if it happens again in your care?</h3>
<p>Start timing it &#8211; it&#8217;s probably going to feel longer than how much time has actually passed. Falling asleep is normal as long as breathing is happening, and as long as he is responsive and &#8220;comes out of it&#8221; within an hour of happening, it&#8217;s really nothing to be concerned about[ref]I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;m going to be concerned every time it happens anyway[/ref]. Put him down on the floor and turn his head to side in case he vomits. If the seizure continues for more than 4 minutes, call 911. If it doesn&#8217;t last for more than 10 minutes, we don&#8217;t need to bring him in to be assessed but since it takes a few minutes for the ambulance to come, preemptively calling them after 4 minutes is okay.  Paramedics advised us to strip him down to diaper to bring down his temperature as well. The pamphlet the hospital gave us also told us not to put him in a bath to bring down his temperature and don&#8217;t put anything in their mouths; they will not swallow their tongue. If he&#8217;s feverish, give him the correct dosage of Tylenol / Advil to avoid peaking over 38C.</p>
<h3>P.S. As usual, God&#8217;s fingerprint was all over this.</h3>
<p>He prepared me for this in two ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>I was supposed to be out that evening watching a movie with a friend but because I forgot to arrange the logistics with j.w (dinner, rides, car, etc.) and because the kids were still napping past the time, I missed it.</li>
<li>I have been on a long wait list for a LTE WiFi hotspot router from the library. My hold finally came up the day before this happened and j.w managed to pick it up for me. I was thinking, &#8220;I&#8217;m not going anywhere this week, why would I need internet on the go?&#8221; Well, he thought to throw it into my hospital bag as I was rushing out, and thankfully I had it because I wouldn&#8217;t have paid $10 for internet for the 5 hours that we were there. It enabled me to keep family and friends up-to-date, and I was encouraged to learn that so many were praying for us &#8211; and asking if we needed any help! Thank you, as always 🙂</li>
</ol>
<p>I pray we won&#8217;t experience this again, but if it does happen, at least I know what to expect -sort of; I feel one can never be &#8220;ready enough&#8221; to get married, to get pregnant, to have kids, and now to parent, but I know I&#8217;m never alone in this journey.		</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				Today marks the end of steamed milk in my coffee, grilled cheese sandwiches, peanut butter pretzels and buttered popcorn, yogurt, ice cream, and other products containing milk, possibly soy, and peanuts in my diet until the end of our breastfeeding days, which&nbsp;might be for another year or more. While I only have to endure it until the end of our breastfeeding time together, our little one might have to watch his diet for the rest of his life &#8211; I&#8217;m sad for him, but at least he won&#8217;t have memories of enjoying those, so he may have less cravings for them, and hopefully better self-control (than I do!)[ref]I didn&#8217;t realize how much I regularly enjoy milk products until now, even though I don&#8217;t care for milk itself[/ref].&nbsp;<br />
I once suspected that milk might have been the culprit in his&nbsp;bouts of eczema and bloody stools[ref]though the latter might still be as a result of constipation[/ref], when he was known to spit up after every feeding (I would say mild reflux), and experienced three vomiting episodes after eating one serving of rice cereal that contained milk ingredients, but I was in denial; how could it be? My daily diet only consisted of milk in my one cup of espresso &#8211; or so I thought; I forgot about the cheese, ice cream, butter, everything else that has milk protein in it. I&#8217;m pretty sure I was in denial, so I didn&#8217;t&nbsp;cut anything in my diet, thinking that it wasn&#8217;t really an allergy, and like his sister, would outgrow it. Now, after a visit to an allergist and a positive prick/rash/allergy test, it&#8217;s official: he&nbsp;has a milk and peanut&nbsp;allergy.<br />
So now, our low-maintenance baby has become a high-maintenance one; I guess our &#8220;easy&#8221; baby was too good to be true. Yet, this news comes at a timely moment in our lives; we&#8217;re reading through&nbsp;<em>The Power of a Praying Parent</em> by Stormie Omartian (I keep thinking it&#8217;s &#8220;O&#8217;Martian&#8221;), and we just covered a chapter that talks about releasing our children to God, and this is an example of a very much an appropriate moment to follow her model of prayer: that if it&#8217;s in His will and in His time, that our son will outgrow both his allergies; but&nbsp;if not, will be managed well so that no one would ever need to use an epipen on him; but if so, that it is administered successfully and effectively.<br />
I&#8217;m still processing the news, so I didn&#8217;t get a chance to think of and ask the many follow-up questions that have since popped up (stemming from online research and what others have shared with me &#8211; yep, I&#8217;m also one of those internet moms), but here are some questions that people have asked and the answers I have come across:<br />
<strong>Q. Will he outgrow his&nbsp;allergy?<br />
A.&nbsp;</strong><a href="http://aacijournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1710-1492-7-S1-S7#Sec12" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Possibly</a>. Our allergist says that many children outgrow their milk allergy by the age of 5. I just found out&nbsp;that my siblings and I all had milk allergies until we were 1 years old, and our mother experimented by trying to reintroduce milk slowly and over time. However, only 20% of kids outgrow their peanut allergy. Because Bean seemed to have a milder reaction to peanut butter when she was younger, but outgrew it by 2 years old &#8211; which surprised him, the allergist suggested paying for a blood test to see if her brother&nbsp;would qualify for reintroduction of peanuts under clinical supervision; we&#8217;re praying that&nbsp;he&#8217;d be eligible. So, as of now, it is what it is &#8211; will just have to adapt to manage it.<br />
<strong>Q. How severe is his allergy?<br />
A.</strong> At the skin prick test, the one for peanuts was about 5mm, and the one for milk was slightly larger (6mm, maybe?); I think&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15482519" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the size indicates a positive diagnosi</a>s,&nbsp;but I didn&#8217;t think to ask. According to one site,&nbsp;&#8220;<a href="http://www.kidswithfoodallergies.org/page/food-allergy-test-diagnosis-skin-prick-blood.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">no test [&#8230;] can determine severity</a>&#8220;. Nevertheless,&nbsp;we&#8217;ve been advised to keep two epipens with him. While, I don&#8217;t know the criteria for what makes an allergy a risk for anaphylaxis, we have&nbsp;seen <a href="http://aacijournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1710-1492-7-S1-S6#Sec4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">symptoms matching the criteria in Table 3, section 2 (GI and skin symptoms)</a>&nbsp;and <a href="http://aacijournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1710-1492-7-S1-S6#Sec3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">in this table</a>.<br />
The allergist&nbsp;prescribed two injectors (<a href="http://www.kidswithfoodallergies.org/page/newly-diagnosed.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">as does this site</a>), but I think&nbsp;most people I know only carry one. Although he does not meet <a href="http://aacijournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1710-1492-10-40" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the minimum recommended weight of 15 KG (33 LBs)</a>, the allergist still recommended that over a self-administered antidote citing that human / user error is very common. He then used an ultrasound machine to measure the thickness of muscle between the skin and the bone, to make sure that our son&#8217;s thighs is fat enough &#8211; more than 13mm &#8211; <a href="http://aacijournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1710-1492-10-40#Sec2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">so that the injection won&#8217;t hit bone</a> (and bone marrow, which is equivalent to a IV administration and that&#8217;s bad); he was 16mm. Another option is available (TwinJet?) but is supposedly the same dose.<br />
<strong>Q. Is there no other option other than Epipen? What about Benadryl?</strong><br />
<strong>A. </strong>The allergist and online sources tells me that&nbsp;Benadryl won&#8217;t help with breathing, but it may help reduce other symptoms (e.g. puffy eyes, lips).<br />
<strong>Q. What can he drink instead of milk, to get the fat content and other nutrients that is in whole milk?<br />
A.&nbsp;</strong>My dietician and online sources say that breastmilk is best so to keep breastfeeding for as long as possible. As long as we have the go ahead to eat soy, we can also have soy and coconut milk; there&#8217;s rice and almond milk as well. I&#8217;ve tried hemp milk, and it tastes like grassy straw, which I&#8217;m not a fan of at all. Fortified alternatives provide at least 30% calcium and some fat content, but it doesn&#8217;t completely replace milk&#8217;s benefits; it&#8217;s also a shame that many companies use carrageenan (or xanthan gum, but not as bad) to thicken their drink, and add sea salt to flavour it. I have to remember to continue to supplement him with Vitamin D. For good fat, I will likely have to be more creative, using oils like avocado or olive, and serving more salmon (frozen filet steaks of wild Alaskan salmon is readily available from Kirkland / Costco year-round, works out to be 10$/lb which is reasonable)<br />
<strong>Q. What about formula?<br />
A.&nbsp;</strong>Online sources seem to suggest that if a baby has a milk allergy, baby may have a higher likelihood of developing a soy allergy, so switching to a soy based formula may end up increasing the risk.<br />
<strong>Q. Can he have lactose-free, cheese, or yogurt? What about goat&#8217;s or sheep&#8217;s milk?<br />
A.&nbsp;</strong>Unfortunately, the allergy is to the milk protein, not the lactose. Most people with milk allergy is to cow&#8217;s milk protein, but I&#8217;m not sure if we have the go-ahead to try other kinds of dairy.<br />
I did mention that I had accidentally fed him vegetables cooked in butter a couple of times and failed to see a reaction, to which he was surprised, so as a result, he told me keep to doing it, but don&#8217;t go beyond what I normally would have done. We will likely have to monitor him very, very closely if we do that &#8211; not to mention, we&#8217;ll have to watch&nbsp;him even more closely when we aren&#8217;t the ones providing his meal / food. Though, I wonder if he&nbsp;can tolerate <a href="https://aacijournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1710-1492-8-5#Sec1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">extreme heated milk products</a>&nbsp;&#8211; will have to ask.<br />
<strong>Q. Can he have other nuts?</strong><br />
A. In theory, yes. Peanuts is technically a legume and not a tree nut (e.g walnut, pecan), but we have to be careful of cross contamination because they may be processed in facility that isn&#8217;t peanut free.<br />
<strong>Q. What about peanut oil?</strong><br />
<strong>A.</strong> I&#8217;m not sure about this one. Online sources say that pure unrefined peanut oil should be safe, but I need to check with the allergist about this one. Will likely have to avoid though,&nbsp;especially in commercial places, like restaurants &#8211; because can you be sure that it&#8217;s pure and unrefined?<br />
<strong>Q. So, are you a peanut and dairy-free household now?</strong><br />
<strong>A.</strong> Thankfully, complete elimination measures aren&#8217;t necessary at this time. In fact, the allergist told us specifically not to stop giving our daughter peanut butter! However,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.hamiltonhealthsciences.ca/documents/Patient%20Education/CowMilkProteinAllergyWhatToEatBreastfeeding-trh.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mom will also need to follow a similar elimination diet</a>, which will be a challenge, as she can&#8217;t eat anything from the allium family either (e.g garlic, onions, chives, leeks).<br />
<strong>Q.</strong> <strong>What can I do to help?</strong><br />
<strong>A.</strong> Pray for us &#8211; I (we) have no idea what I&#8217;m (we&#8217;re) doing. Trying to avoid garlic, onions, etc. is already hard; I&#8217;m also thinking that avoiding dairy will likely be more challenging than peanuts. And, if you eat with us, we especially appreciate that you take our dietary needs into consideration &#8211; understandably, it&#8217;s probably&nbsp;especially hard if you&nbsp;don&#8217;t need to conscientious of it in your everyday life; I&#8217;m sorry for the inconvenience. If you&#8217;re in a similar family situation, I&#8217;m open to hearing advice and your experiences too. Thank you!		</p>

<p>Though some days, it feels like more. The latest word trend after terrible twos, is not terrifying threes, but threenager. This past year was definitely a year of growth for Bean, both physically and developmentally, expressing herself more verbally, and understanding negotiation tactics, and lately, how to use a firm no. Instead of terrible or tantrum twos (thankfully), I would say teary twos, with more tears&nbsp; as of late and constant[ly the same] questions, accompanied with some whining, as she flip flips from learned independence to craved dependence. She enjoys watching mommy cook and helps out wherever she can: whether it&#8217;s loading the laundry machine, putting dishes away, prepping food for cooking &#8211; I often have to remind myself that although it&#8217;s often faster to do it myself, it&#8217;s these moments that are teaching and practice opportunities, and that I will likely regret it later when she does grow up and decide helping mommy do house chores isn&#8217;t exactly fun.&nbsp; She&#8217;s growing up though: almost toilet-trained (didn&#8217;t take the 3 day potty training route), figured out how to blow her nose, uses the correct personal pronouns more often, and eagerly takes on older sister roles, like feeding the baby, or watching and/or playing with him (ie. bossing him around) while mommy is momentarily occupied or keeping a watchful eye from a distance, which when he co-operates is quite wonderful as I can multi-task. She also enjoys finishing off her brother&#8217;s unfinished leftovers, which I remember I enjoyed too when my younger brother was eating baby food. Lately though, she has also reverted to not wanting to sleep on her own at night and wakes up multiple times in one night.<br />
Things that have not changed much through the first three years:</p>
<ol>
<li>She is&nbsp; happy to be the cautious observer-follower instead of the leader, though she can be determined/persistent (aka stubborn, like both her parents) &#8211; which sometimes translates to being fiesty, and/or bossy. For her, being a cautious observer seems to lends well to having an eye for detail and a good memory.</li>
<li>She hates the feeling of tears and runny nose on her face when it is caused by crying and she refuses to wipe it herself. The more you make her, the more water works result &#8211; a vicious cycle, really. Meltdowns often happen around some seemingly inconsequential thing, but it&#8217;s really a build-up of unsaid/unresolved feelings inside (maybe it&#8217;s feeling like she&#8217;s not being heard or lack of closeness / security that you&#8217;re there)</li>
<li>Early enthused independence of feeding herself does not translate to continued self-independence</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<h2>2:</h2>
<p>In other developmental news, our almost 8-month old can now roll over from front to back, and back to front, though I think he really just rolls in one direction each way. He also can sit up unassisted for extended periods, and we have been practicing moving by trying to place items he wants a little beyond his reach. While he mouths everything, I can already sense that he is a much pickier eater than Bean was, despite his love for bananas and apples and sometimes sweet potatoes; he appears to really dislike yogurt, and maybe because it&#8217;s really cold and when upon skin contact, it turned red (like it did with peanut oil, tomatoes, and oranges for Bean). While we haven&#8217;t given rice cereal after that one time when he threw it all up, he doesn&#8217;t seem to have any problems with regular rice or barley. We need to give him more opportunities to practice grabbing food and eating it, which he has been with chunks of bananas, raw chunks of apples and celery sticks (a perfect gnawing/teething food I find), cooked zucchini and pasta tubes (rigatoni), a messy experiment as it often ends up on the floor, though I might try cooked broccoli florets or carrots next; the harder foods like apples and celery I need to watch closely as sometimes he swallows before chewing it well.&nbsp; He&#8217;s still a relatively chill baby, which I am especially thankful for&nbsp;as I don&#8217;t think I would be able to handle two of the same temperaments; he is content to spend time in the playpen (or modern term: play yard) with his toys or chewing on a toy in his swing, preferring these two items more often than in the bouncer, and I can leave him for a short to an extended period, depending on his mood, before he complains, whereas his sister would still prefer that I am next to her all the time, if she had her way.&nbsp; I&#8217;m glad our playpen is getting some use, as Bean didn&#8217;t like it back then (same story with Sophie la giraffe), although she now enjoys going inside at times to sit and play with him! He&#8217;s also been able to effectively eliminate on the mini toilet seat a few times which saved me from having to clean up a messy (cloth) diaper, but we have also encountered baby in pain while trying to strain, poor boy.</p>
<blockquote><p>For this boy I prayed, and the Lord has given me my petition which I asked of Him. So I have also dedicated him to the Lord; as long as he lives he is dedicated to the Lord.&#8221; &#8211; 1 Samuel 1:27-28a (NASB)<br />
Train up a child in the way he should go: and when he is old, he will not depart from it.&#8221; &#8211; Proverbs 22:6 (KJV)</p></blockquote>
<p>As parents, we feel that it is important to lead and spiritually nurture our children so that they will develop a desire to love God and be followers of Christ, so&nbsp; while we had a small baby dedication ceremony at Bean&#8217;s one-month celebration, we decided to wait until j.w&#8217;s family could join us and held off until this year&#8217;s baptism service at our church (which effectively became a baptism + baby dedication service); it was especially meaningful to see our friends and family who don&#8217;t normally go our church present as I felt like they&#8217;re the ones that will support us in raising our children[ref]it takes a village, as the saying goes [/ref].</p>
<hr />
<h2>3:</h2>
<p>A friend recently commented that I look thinner yet again, and to my surprise when I stepped on the scale, she was right. Turns out it took me almost 8 months, 3 months longer to reach the low end of my last postpartum weight loss, and more &#8211; no wonder my pants all feel loose; I was beginning to attribute it to pregnancy stretching them out.&nbsp; I&#8217;d better consult the &#8220;<a href="http://her.happyhippos.ca/2013/12/how-to-gain-more-weight/">How to gain more weight</a>&#8221; post again. /86		</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				If you would have asked me if we would do cloth diapering before baby (BB[ref]though &#8216;BB&#8217; is also synonymous with my BlackBerry, best before, and what we call our current baby[/ref]), it would have been a different response than after baby (AB). I&#8217;m actually quite surprised how far right I am now on the &#8220;<a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=crunchy%20mama" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">crunchy</a>&#8221; spectrum; BB, I would likely have been comfortable with any doctor recommendation [ref]like using steroids, no question asked[/ref], having an epidural, ensuring a hospital birth, and using products with petroleum jelly (i.e. Vaseline). Now AB, I find myself looking for natural solutions first, feeling more comfortable with mama cloth[ref]if you really want to know, look it up[/ref], and have settled on a cloth diaper routine that works with our lifestyle[ref]we&#8217;re neither organic, nor vegan or vegetarian though[/ref]. I would probably say we have a hybrid diapering approach: cloth diapering at home during the day, and disposables overnight and when away for more than 3 hours at time.<br />
A few months ago, someone from the a local shop came to the midwives&#8217; new baby time to chat about cloth diapering and babywearing. Like the mommy-jargon, there&#8217;s plenty of diapering lingo too, like &#8220;stink[ref]the way the diapers smell if it&#8217;s saturated or has residue in it, even after washing &#8211; though I still don&#8217;t know what &#8216;barnyard stink&#8217; is &#8211; probably a good thing[/ref] &#8220;, &#8220;strip[ref]to clean out any residue in attempts to solve a smell or repelling/leaking problem &#8211; I&#8217;ve been using unconcentrated blue dawn from the dollar store[/ref]&#8221;, &#8220;pockets&#8221; or &#8220;prefolds&#8221;[ref]type of cloth diapers[/ref]. After seeing her demonstrate a few diapering options, I think if I had gone into cloth diapering from scratch[ref]then again, if we weren&#8217;t passed down a set, we probably would&#8217;ve only gone with disposables[/ref] and <a href="http://www.kellyscloset.com/Basic-Types-of-Cloth-Diapers-and-How-to-Choose-the-Right-One-for-Your-Family_ep_211-1.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">did some research</a>, I would have ended up with prefolds because it seems the most economic and you don&#8217;t have to toss the diaper cover in the wash after every change (only the inside cloth needs to be laundered), especially if it isn&#8217;t soiled or wet, a system similar to what my mom used with us when we were younger [ref]hers would likely have been classified as flats[/ref] (I still use her diapers cloths as burp cloths and to absorb leaking breastmilk). However, we were passed down a set of Bum Genius hook and loop closure (i.e. Velcro but I think that name is trademarked) diapers with inserts, so we&#8217;ve stuck with the same type of diapers in our stash &#8211; which probably is easier to use for dad and when there is help. I didn&#8217;t even know these were considered pocket diapers until much later. However, I&#8217;ve moved away from stocking velcro-based diapers, because they stick to each other and they seem to wear out faster.<br />
Maybe I am not as meticulous when it comes to taking care of our stuff, but now they are well-used and well-loved in comparison to looking like-new when we first received them (they have been through one child prior). Because the elastics in the legs are also getting more and more relaxed, I&#8217;ve designated these to our toddler and ended buying more diapers to add to my collection, but they&#8217;re not brand-name diapers and they&#8217;re all snap-based instead of velcro. They seem harder to put on and take off, but they don&#8217;t seem to wear out as quickly either. I have also added bamboo diapers and inserts into my collection, and while they seem more soft and absorbent than my microfleece diapers and inserts, stains seem harder to wash out from natural fibers than synthetics. Because we&#8217;re using the bamboo diapers with our baby, I&#8217;m new to EBF stains that turn blue and green after a wash/dry cycle &#8211; can&#8217;t wait for some sunny weather to see if sunlight will help. Thankfully stains don&#8217;t affect function, just the aesthetics. Since I didn&#8217;t spend more than $5 per diaper-insert set, I&#8217;m also not too concerned about needing to sell them again after we no longer use them so the stains aren&#8217;t a big deal.		</p>

Wow! After a little more than two and a half years, Bean is now naturally okay with me leaving the room before falling asleep &#8211; which leaves me with a little more free time in the evenings and some time in the afternoon when her brother is napping. &nbsp;She surprised me when&nbsp;she practically kicked me out during one of her naps when she heard her brother crying the other day, saying that I needed to feed him. Now, I tell her that I&#8217;ve forgotten to brush my teeth, she chimes in and tells me that I&#8217;ve forgotten to shower, and sends me away after I tuck her in and telling her she doesn&#8217;t need to be scared, and leaving the door open a crack. After hearing my mother tell me that if I don&#8217;t let her cry it out, then she will continue to need me until years later (like&nbsp;into school age), I wasn&#8217;t quite prepared for this as she was still making sure to hug me closer when she heard her brother cry just a week or two ago, and then reluctantly let me go after I told her I would come back. We&#8217;re on Day 3 &#8211; dare I&nbsp;hope that this will become a new routine that sticks?		</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				To pee or not to pee, that is the question.<br />
I sometimes wonder whether our toddler feels the urge to go at the most inconvenient times on purpose: in the middle of the meal, or when she&#8217;s supposed to be falling asleep after lights out or during nap time. Of course, this prolongs either routine, and every time I take her, she does of course actually go. But when I ask her if she needs to go outside of those times, of course she doesn&#8217;t (and won&#8217;t). And then, there&#8217;s this&nbsp;strange habit of sucking on her finger when she has the urge to go, which is a nice visual cue for me if I catch it, because she doesn&#8217;t always tell me. Ah, the joys of toilet training (on her schedule instead of a 3 day boot camp schedule).<br />
Woo-hoo! Today marks the first day that the baby fell asleep before the toddler&#8217;s nap time and napped&nbsp;through the long excruciating process, leaving my hands free to pull tissues to wipe her tears and nose while trying to wait for her to fall asleep. Sadly, it&#8217;s the pacifier that saves the day.		</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				Continuing on the theme of two, and just before&nbsp;the second month of the year, Bean reached two and a half, and here&#8217;s what she&#8217;s been learning (play-based):</p>
<h3>Language</h3>
<p>In under two playdates with a 4-year old, her English vocabulary and frequency of use&nbsp;has exploded; now, it&#8217;s almost as if her English switch gets turned on as soon as she steps into her play area. Whether she use words in the right context, or put together nonsensical sentences or words which I know is her attempt at English, she isn&#8217;t afraid to try &#8211; and persist when we don&#8217;t understand her. When she first&nbsp;started speaking (signing and Cantonese), we understood her &#8211; it was almost as if she saved up all she learned before speaking, so this babbling is new to us! I&#8217;m certain she understands more than she can express, which generally happens when one learns a new language; it&#8217;s easier to pick up a language when reading and listening than speaking and writing.<br />
As I listen to her speak more and more English day after day (which I worry she might soon forget her Chinese), I wonder how much more quickly we would pick up a language if we adults approached language learning that way: not being afraid to just go for it even when you might not make sense.<br />
For some of&nbsp;her Cantonese, sometimes I can tell who she has&nbsp;picked it up from based on the words&nbsp;she uses. For example, if I hear &#8220;啜筒&#8221; (<em>zyut tung</em>), I know it&#8217;s from Joseph and his side of the family, because I say &#8220;飲筒&#8221; (<em>yum tung</em>); likewise with &#8220;裡<span class="hps">頭</span>&#8221; (<em>lui tou</em>), I say &#8220;裏邊/面&#8221; (<em>lui bian/mian</em>) instead.</p>
<h3>Music</h3>
<p>She still enjoys singing songs and will spontaneously break out in song all day long, especially ones with actions &#8211; either ones that she&#8217;s been singing at Music and Movement, the library, or ones I&#8217;ve been teaching&nbsp;her &#8211; so I am&nbsp;trying o find Christian songs that are easy to learn in Cantonese to pass on (so far, I&#8217;ve managed <em>Jesus Loves Me</em> with 2 missing words, and parts of two other songs I sang in my childhood).</p>
<h3>Colours and Letters</h3>

She&#8217;s also at the point where she will make and remember associations, so I&#8217;ve found success with helping her identify colours and alphabet letters, although sometimes, she will just say &nbsp;the association, like &#8220;Daddy&#8221; instead of &#8220;D&#8221; &#8211; but I know that she recognizes that letter now, because she says the same association every time.&nbsp;Other letters she recognizes is O, &#8220;Breanna&#8221; or &#8220;Baby&#8221; B, &#8220;mama&#8221; E (maybe because&nbsp;of&nbsp;my name?), &#8220;doggie-bone&#8221; I,&nbsp;sometimes &#8220;moon-crescent&#8221; C and &#8220;snake&#8221; S, &nbsp;and consistently &#8220;Leia P&#8221; (but it&#8217;s really an A). This opens up new activities to try, such as at&nbsp;restaurants, instead of doing word search on the kids menu, we do letter search.<br />
For colours, we&#8217;ve progressed from doggie brown to sunshine yellow and fire engine red &#8211; and she just somehow knows the colour green, so it&#8217;s her favourite colour of the moment. She can sometimes also identify cloud/blueberry blue, purple and pink. With her new-found love for green, she has also begun to collect objects of the same colour and sort them.</p>

She has started to assert more independence (which often leads to doing especially when told not to do), or wanting to do more things on her own, so I&#8217;ve asked her to help me get a diaper and wipe when changing her brother, pick out her table setting and bring it to the table at meal times, (re)wash her bib after she&#8217;s done with it, and let her figure out how to put on a pair of elastic-waist pants and bite my tongue when it ends up being backwards.<br />

I know many children at this age can put on clothes, socks, jackets, etc. but we haven&#8217;t mastered those skills yet. Toilet-training is also slow progress &#8211; some days she knows and will tell me she needs to go, and other days, she is happy to pee in her training underwear and not care or seem to notice the couch has gotten wet (still thankful she self-trained for poop for over a year now).<br />

Meals are still spent half self-feeding, with help from an adult once she gets bored with self-feeding (or isn&#8217;t as hungry anymore), especially with food choices that aren&#8217;t as easy to self feed because it requires utensils or may be messier, like soup noodles or rice with <em>soong</em>; she can pretty much eat an entire sandwich or a serving of sushi rolls on her own though.<br />

When it comes to art and drawing, she&#8217;s starting to be able to trace around objects and the other day, she coloured within the lines &#8211; we have yet to find out if that was an accident or not. She is starting to cut by following lines with scissors and thread objects through a pipe cleaner, but she&#8217;s not at the point where she does it repeatedly / enjoys it yet.&nbsp;<br />
This afternoon&#8217;s&nbsp;blog post is brought to you by the peace and quiet of two children napping away, a first! Will report back at three; hope it&nbsp;won&#8217;t be&nbsp;the terrifying threes.		</p>
