								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				<![CDATA[<b>CCF and me. </b>
  

<p>Hearing the voice of God and following His will is never easy, at least not
    for me. Most of the time, it’s not even about obedience, but rather,
    I struggle with the first part&#8211;listening and being able to recognise the
    voice of God. Maybe I’m a literalist, and if so, I admit that I am not
    able to discern the will of God through a still small voice, unlike Samuel
    in the Bible. I thought I was different because I remember in my high school
    fellowship one year, a speaker distinctly told us that she literally heard
    God’s voice calling her to serve at YWAM (Youth With A Mission), a Christian
    organisation that has a focus in inner-city missions. I could not identify
    with her, for God definitely did not speak to me in that way. Many times,
    I just figured that my spiritual walk was not mature enough even though I
    saw God at work through other means. However, I must say, I do believe that
    God works through my life, in the lives of others, and through different circumstances,
    to show me what I need to do to follow and glorify Him. </p>


  

<p>So if you ask me why I’m serving on CCF (Chinese Christian Fellowship)
    committee this term, I would not be able to give you a solid answer. I cannot
    say that I heard God’s voice because I don’t &#8220;hear&#8221; His
    voice. I cannot say I was called either, because I was not convicted and my
    conscience has not been nagging me for saying &#8220;no&#8221; since the end
    of my 1B term. I wasn’t dying to serve on committee either. If you have
    not already noticed, I’m not a very vocal person, especially in large
    groups. Apparently, I’m a task-structured person, which explains why
    I don’t exactly like sharing about myself because I don’t know what
    to say unless I’m answering a series of questions. Unfortunately, when
    sharing, there are no questions to answer. I also remember that the girls
    in previous committees were so passionate that they would cry during their
    sharing. Don’t get me wrong, crying is okay and it doesn’t show
    signs of weakness, but I just hope I don’t do that. Anyway, onto my sharing
    . . . </p>


  

<p>How then did I end up on committee if I didn&#8217;t feel a strong calling from
    God? For some odd reason, I had a feeling that I most likely would be asked
    one day to serve on committee even before I came to Waterloo. Why? Before
    heading out to Waterloo, my mother cautioned me against saying &#8220;yes&#8221;
    to committee too quickly for fear of falling behind in my studies. She seem
    to have known that I was likely to be involved in a fellowship, perhaps because
    she saw how much time was spent as a committee member for 2 years in my youth
    fellowship. </p>


  

<p>In my last year of high school, I decided to further explore CCF at Waterloo
    by finding their site online and e-mailing them a series of questions. I was
    all ready to go to a Chinese speaking fellowship when Dylan surprised me by
    saying that CCF is held in English and less than half of the people were even
    Chinese speaking! Ironically and amusingly, when I later met Dylan face to
    face, I realised that he didn’t even know much Chinese in the first place.
  </p>


  

<p>I was slightly disappointed at the fact that CCF wasn’t as Chinese as
    I expected. Even though I am a &#8220;jok-sing&#8221;, as people like to term
    us CBCs, I was ready to try another Chinese fellowship. I was encouraged to
    see Sandra lead some praise and worship songs at the NSR Dinner (perhaps even
    Praise and Worship night too) in Chinese and with the English &#8220;pinyin&#8221;
    underneath. I was very impressed :). To also learn that at one point CCF was
    led entirely in Chinese and the ratio of Chinese speaking to the English speaking
    was almost exponentially declining every year, was saddening especially since
    I saw more and more people speak Chinese around campus. Additionally, an exchange
    student from Hong Kong shared with us his experience with CCF, which impacted
    and challenged the ones that were left to carry on his vision once he returned
    home. Perhaps that is why I have always felt the burden to reach out to the
    Cantonese or even Mandarin-speaking, even to the point where I offered to
    lead a mixed English/Mandarin-speaking cell group in my 3A term. Yes, even
    though, &#8220;wo de guo yu bu hao; wo bu ke yi jiang, ye dou bu dong.&#8221;
  </p>


  

<p>I felt at home in CCF even in my first term. Although I must admit that I
    had trouble making friends that were my own age group, the people I got to
    know really influenced me. Most of them who had touched my life have already
    graduated and I am encouraged at what they have left behind, or what they
    still see in CCF. I glance back into time, and realise that it is through
    cell groups that I have learned the most. That is why cell groups are also
    very important to me. There were days that I only had fun and did not learn
    anything spiritual, but I learned from the people in the cell groups. They
    taught me a lot, especially through life example (okay, for life example,
    maybe excluding Carey in certain cases . . . well, maybe what not to do).
    These people influenced my ways of thinking, and how I act today. If they
    did not pay any attention to young frosh like myself, I may not have continued
    to attend CCF. I may have listened to a certain campus fellowship that regarded
    CCF as being less important because they saw that reaching out to Chinese
    was merely reaching out to a tiny portion of the bigger picture. But, I’m
    glad I didn’t. I’m glad I saw the importance of reaching out to
    people of the Chinese culture and that CCF took care to look after the frosh.
  </p>


  

<p>Although I did not get a distinct calling to serve on committee, nor had
    a choice on what position to take, I can say that my experience on committee
    thus far, has definitely been worthwhile. My first impression of serving in
    committee was meetings, meetings, and more meetings, especially in the first
    couple of weeks. Interestingly enough, Dylan said that meetings were one of
    his favourite pastimes. I thought that he was crazy. Well, I’m not so
    sure myself anymore. He still may be crazy, but I have to agree that meetings
    are similar to cell groups in itself and are very much enjoyable, especially
    prayer meetings. We share so much with each other, including laughter and
    Dill’s crisis of the week, and Pork’s (ahem, Abe’s) super long
    prayer requests <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f61b.png" alt="😛" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> . I learn a lot from these people and by serving on committee,
    I also see the fervour in encouraging other CCF members to be actively involved
    with campus ministry. I see &#8220;vision&#8221; being lived out. </p>


  

<p>The term vision has been overused since my first year, but at least I understand
    what the difference between purpose, vision, and mission of CCF now. I realise
    (with the help of Peter Lau) that the vision of CCF is the big picture of
    what God wants us to accomplish to advance his kingdom, the mission is the
    objective(s) set to help fulfill the vision, and finally, the purpose is why
    CCF exists. With those definitions, I can place evangelism under vision with
    certainty and short and long-term goals (programs, active ministries, etc.)
    with mission. Why CCF exists? Well, I would say it would ultimately be to
    carry out the Great Commission as set out by Jesus in Matthew 28:19-20. Additionally,
    I would say that because we are the Chinese Christian Fellowship, we are set
    apart from the rest of the fellowships because we have our roots in the Chinese
    heritage and therefore, we are the key to reach the Chinese&#8211;be it Mandarin
    or Cantonese-speaking, or even the CBCs! I don’t feel as hopeless or
    as helpless as I did in first year, and I can better support the fellowship
    because I understand where CCF is going, or at least trying to go. Most importantly,
    I see what steps CCF will take to continue to reach out to those on campus.
  </p>


  

<p>Back to the question, so after all this has been said, why am I on committee?
    Well, like I have previously said I have no &#8220;real&#8221; reason. My only
    reason is because I ran out of excuses. Last term I promised God that if my
    marks turned out well in my first term in English, I would say &#8220;yes&#8221;
    to anyone who asked me to serve on committee. With God’s sense of humour,
    He gave me the highest average that I have ever seen on my transcript in my
    university career. I’m thankful for my marks and because of what I promised
    before, how could I say &#8220;no&#8221; when Dill asked me? So that’s
    my tale. </p>


  

<p>NB. Most references to &#8220;Chinese&#8221; refers to the Cantonese dialect.

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				<![CDATA[<b>Overview of My Vision for CCF&#8217;s Cantonese Ministry</b>
  

<p>I was slightly disappointed at the fact that CCF wasn&#8217;t as Chinese
    as I expected. Even though I am a &#8220;jook-sing&#8221;, as people like to
    term us CBCs, I was ready to try another Chinese fellowship. I was encouraged

    even to the point where I offered to lead a mixed English/Mandarin-speaking
    cell group in my 3A term. Yes, even though, &#8220;wo de guo yu bu hao; wo
    bu ke yi jiang, ye dou bu dong&#8221; (that says in pinyin: &#8220;My Mandarin
    isn&#8217;t good; I can&#8217;t speak it, and don&#8217;t understand it.&#8221;).</p>


  

<p>I felt at home in CCF even in my first term. Although I must admit that I
    had trouble making friends that were my own age group, the people I got to
    know really influenced me. Most of them who had touched my life have already

    the Chinese culture and that CCF took care to look after the frosh. </p>







    The term vision has been overused since my first year, but at least I understand
    what the difference between purpose, vision, and mission of CCF now. I realise
    (with the help of Peter Lau) that the vision of CCF is the big picture of
    what God wants us to accomplish to advance his kingdom, the mission is the
    objective(s) set to help fulfill the vision, and finally, the purpose is why

    understand where CCF is going, or at least trying to go. Most importantly,
    I see what steps CCF will take to continue to reach out to those on campus.
    




    The above was from past reflections from my time at CCF. From my first year
    until now, the only cell groups that I have been in are the Chinese speaking
    or &#8220;mixed&#8221; Chinese/English ones. Each term and year, whether in
    cell groups, amongst the more &#8220;inclined to be Chinese speaking&#8221;
    brothers and sisters, or in General Leadership meetings, there has been talk
    of action (i.e. all talk, no action) in the Chinese ministry. I believe that
    Pork (Abraham) actively tried to implement something last year as he was a
    core committee member, but much of our efforts fail often because of the culture
    clash between language, styles of worship, etc. between the Chinese-speaking
    and the CBCs. In one Insight article (which I include here), Carey (CCF alumni)
    tries to illustrate the differences between the two cultures and attempts
    to bridge the cultural gap.
    






<p>
    Fast forward to the present, as this ministry is separate from the English-speaking
    side of CCF, we can solidify our vision in a more feasible manner. I see our
    current meeting group as a group for prayer, planning and growth. I believe
    that prior to reaching outward, we need to reach inward. We need to be able
    to establish a group of brothers and sisters who are unified with one vision
    and share a common goal whether it is to serve in the English, Cantonese,
    or the Mandarin side of campus ministry. I feel that the 3 sub-fellowships
    will work, but it will need much prayer and commitment from willing hearts.
    I pray that this term&#8217;s efforts will be fruitful, and not be passively disappointing
    once again (i.e. all talk, no action).</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				<![CDATA[<b>Serving on CCF Committee for Winter 2001 as a co-Devotional
    Leader </b><br />
    As seen by BP
  

<p><b>Responsibilities</b></p>


  

<p>Please refer to the following for detailed description of the duties and
    responsibilities of a Devotional Leader (hereon in referred to as DL):</p>




<ul>
  

<li>
   CCF Handbook )  </li>


  

<li>
CCF Constitution )
  </li>


  

<li>
   Winnie&#8217;s feedback on being DL
  </li>



<li>Abraham&#8217;s feedback on being DL/serving CCF (<a href="http://www.impression.com/xalt/ccf.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://www.impression.com/xalt/ccf.html</a>).</li>


</ul>


  

<p><b>Reflection</b></p>


  

<p>Things that went well:</p>




<ul>
  

<li>
<i>Co-leader/DL</i><br />
      Unlike many other terms, there were 2 DLs serving on the committee. For
      myself, that could mean one of two things: that I could slack off in my
      duties, or have my load lightened with a co-leader. Fortunately, I still
      felt the need to do my part, so I didn&#8217;t slack off even though I needed
      to focus on my academics even more. The co-leader really helped me maintain
      a balance between my academics and committee work.
  </li>


  

<li>
    i>Cell-Group Co-ordinator<br />
      A willing heart allowed the DLs to focus on the Bible Study ministry more.
      Instead of serving on committee, this person volunteered his time to co-ordinate
      cell groups and periodically obtained feedback from each cell group (leader).
  </li>


  

<li>
    <i>Frosh Cell-Group</i><br />
      Even though the frosh cell-group should not be an individual point/bullet,
      the first frosh cell-group sprouted in Fall 2000 and continued on into the
      Winter term. From what I saw, this cell-group really provided the support
      and place for the frosh to bond with each other as well as develop their
      leadership skills.
  </li>


  

<li>
<i>Prayer and Pre-studies</i><br />
      Prayer was the glue to everything! Without weekly prayer, we would not have
      seen the amount of Bible Study Leaders (BSLs) that showed up to the pre-studies.
      Furthermore, 2 timeslots for pre-studies (i.e. 2 pre-studies in one week)
      allowed BSLs to show up to the one that was more flexible for them.
  </li>


  

<li>
<i>Meetings</i><br />
      Weekly committee prayer and planning meetings helped the committee stay
      focused in allowing accountability, short-term planning, and follow-up on
      feedback from different members of CCF. General meetings (where all members
      of CCF were welcomed to attend) allowed the committee to see members&#8217; visions,
      ideas, and suggestions for the CCF term.
  </li>


  

<li>
<i>Feedback</i><br />
      The DLs asked the BSLs each time they led a Bible Study for some feedback
      on the topic, the dynamics of the group, etc., which allowed follow-up and
      response in how future Bible Studies were planned.
  </li>


</ul>


  

<p><b>Response</b></p>


  

<p>Tips and Suggestions:</p>




<ul>
  

<li>
<i>Personal Devotional Life</i><br />
      Your devotional life will reflect to others, in your effort and work in
      serving on committee. A strong or consistent devotional life makes serving
      much more enjoyable and easier.
  </li>


  

<li>
<i>Focus</i><br />
      To have the most effective term, a good idea is to establish a focus at
      the start of the term. In the Bible Study ministry: to plan a focus and
      even perhaps a theme. For example, in the previous term, our Bible Studies
      had an evangelistic focus-targeted for seekers.
  </li>


  

<li>
    <i>Serving in CCF</i><br />
      The committee should encourage that serving in CCF ministries is a privilege
      and honour for those who are Christians (in some cases in the past academic
      year, non-Christians wanted to serve as BSLs or successfully served on the
      worship team and lead Christians and non-Christians alike to God). DLs should
      especially focus on the Bible Study and Cell-Group leaders and to pair-up
      new or inexperienced/unconfident leaders with experienced ones.
  </li>


  

<li>
<i>Training</i><br />
      Leadership workshops and training for BSLs and other ministries (e.g. IBS)
      would serve to be effective for CCF as a whole. AFC/GTO (or the post-graduate
      organization) is willing to help if you ask them.
  </li>


  

<li>
<i>Accountability</i><br />
      Accountability with each committee member and the fellowship as a whole
      provides a network of support and spiritual bonding. For myself, I needed
      to improve in committing to pray for each committee member on a regular
      basis and for the fellowship aside from the regular committee prayer meetings
      or merely on occasion. Aside from prayer, another way to keep each other
      accountable is to provide and promote a Bible-reading plan or Christian
      reading materials-one that previous terms&#8217; committee successfully established
      but our committee didn&#8217;t really maintain/promote.
  </li>


  

<li>
<i>Communication</i><br />
      Communication with the rest of the committee members and for any necessary
      CCF members/leaders is crucial in establishing an organised and well-planned
      term.</li>

</ul>

<p><b>Me:</b> Hi. This is actually my first year at Campus Challenge because
    I normally go home every year. I am originally from Vancouver, BC but I am
    currently working in Ottawa for the summer. In September, I will be entering
    my 4th year as an undergraduate student at the University of Waterloo. As
    much as I would like to say that I am studying CS or Engineering or something
    that Waterloo is known for, I am not. I&#8217;m actually majoring in English by
    choice. =)</p>


  

<p><b>Nat:</b> My name is Natalie Wong. I am currently a grad student at UT.
    My current field of studies is in Electrical Engineering. This is my first
    year at UT. I previously completed my undergrad program at U. Waterloo. </p>


  

<p>I have accepted Christ right before entering university. Throughout my undergrad
    years, I have been serving in Waterloo CCF (in cell groups, IBS groups, in
    the committee, etc.) God has revealed himself most to me during these years,
    which has ultimately shaped my life as an individual. I believe that the years
    we spend in university is the most crucial turning point in our life journey.
    At the same time, the campus setting is truly unique, where students are most
    exposed to higher learning and a broader worldview. Some say that university
    life prepares you for the real world. In actual fact, the university life
    is the real world. In this type of setting, it is so important for us, as
    Chinese Christian students, to integrate our faith into our studies, to live
    out our Christian lives, and to bring forth Christ&#8217;s love on campus where
    there is such a need. </p>


  

<p> <i>What changes have you been observing about your respective campuses recently?</i>


    <b>Me: </b>Well, first there are visual changes that make it obvious that
    the university is slowly expanding. If you walk around our campus, you see
    that many buildings are either renovating or expanding. New classrooms and
    offices are implemented and new buildings for classes or other student/campus
    services are being constructed as well. Even the School of Architecture is
    relocating to a new building in Cambridge in 2003.


    Another clue that the university population is growing is the number of new
    buildings that are designated to be residences for frosh only. I think that
    UW realises that many universities in Ontario are guaranteeing residence for
    the frosh, so they need to be just as competitive. Last year, they had one
    new building, but in the coming years, they plan to have at least 3 more.


    There are also less obvious changes. Even though my program has next to zero
    Chinese-speaking students, I notice that there is an influx of graduate students
    that are from Mainland China, the increase of number of campus clubs, growth
    in attendance in fellowship and local churches. Additionally, in the UW daily
    info, the bulletin often announces special talks with guest speakers that
    talk about the &#8220;double cohort&#8221; issue.</p>


  

<p>Changes in technology seem to be implemented including the ability to allow
    students to check their marks online (instead of just relying through the
    mail) beginning the Fall term, the Faculty of Arts will also be using percentages
    to determine final grades instead of placing students in a range of letters,
    and students are able to choose their own timetable now (including view a
    list of professors who are teaching in the next term).</p>


  

<p> <b>Nat:</b> As a grad student, I am constantly interacting with many other
    grad students in electrical engineering. One of the trends that I&#8217;ve noticed
    about the campus is that there are a lot of international students &#8211; both
    in the graduate level and the undergrad level. In general, many of them come
    from Mainland China and Hong Kong, and also from Muslim countries such as
    Iran, Pakistan, and India. They come to Canada under as a VISA student, and
    most of them are actually quite mature in age. Many of them have their own
    families with them (i.e. Spouse and children). And definitely, these grad
    students are highly intellectual people. </p>


  

<p>Another thing that I notice about my campus is that there has been a lack
    of faculty members. One reason for this is because a large number of professors
    are at an age of retirement. Another reason that is occurring is that many
    engineering professors are &#8220;starting-up&#8221; their own companies, and
    patenting their own research ideas. As a result of this, a lack of faculty
    members trickles down to many uncertainties. </p>


  

<p> In a way, the double cohort situation brings forth a great deal of anxiety
    to the high school students, as well as to the Ontario universities. Will
    there be quality educators to teach them? How will they be able to excel in
    their studies in such a competitive environment? What kind of career path
    will this lead them to? These are some of the questions that would arise.
  </p>


  

<p>More and more professors are relying on their grad students to teach the
    course materials. Interestingly enough, grad students are regarded as part
    of the faculty. And therefore, due to the large increase in university enrolment,
    the Ontario universities have been trying to lobby the government to increase
    funding to attract intellectual grad students from all over the world, and
    hopefully, to hire new faculty educators. As our UT President, Robert Birgeneau
    says, research universities are the prime source of the qualified researchers
    and teachers who people our nation&#8217;s research, educational and industrial
    enterprise.&#8221; </p>


  

<p>Overall, the double cohort issue isn&#8217;t simply an issue that is affecting
    the undergraduate level. </p>


  

<p><i> As an undergraduate student, who may see the large influx of students,
    what do all this issues mean to you? How do you see your role fit in the changing
    university campuses?<br />
    </i><br />
    <b>Me:</b> Because I only have approximately 1.5 years left as an undergrad
    student, I won&#8217;t be immediately and directly affected by any changes that
    might occur in 2003. However, it doesn&#8217;t mean that I can be passive now because
    I can only imagine how many challenges are ahead. As a high school graduate,
    it was already difficult enough to apply to any program in Waterloo because
    of its good reputation and various programs. I remember that back then, students
    need a 95% Grade 12 GPA just to be considered for Computer Engineering or
    CS at Waterloo, along with a high score in the Descartes math contest. I can
    see that eventually, due to the mass number of students applying to Ontario
    universities in 2003, many universities may withdraw their offers of scholarships,
    or they will offer it only to the top 5% of the class, which would mean that
    as an student, there will be more academic competition, and increasing pressure
    to excel.</p>


  

<p> To keep a limit, UW has set a max increase of 15% in 2003, and plans to
    balance the influx of students in 2004. Teachers of Ontario high schools are
    even encouraging their students to stay behind an extra year for the optional
    OAC. However, even if there was not an influx of students at UW, I have noticed
    a trend that many high school seniors are entering universities immediately
    after graduation instead of taking time off to work or transferring credits
    from college-most likely because of the increasing demand of degrees from
    various companies. Other universities are also affected by the &#8220;double
    cohort&#8221;-even universities outside of Ontario. A university in New Brunswick
    anticipates to accept more students in 2003, so they are already beginning
    to expand their building as well.</p>


  

<p>As a student, my primary role on campus is to be a student, focusing on my
    academics. However, as a Christian on a changing campus, it would be a greater
    challenge to reach out because there will a greater need to bring the lost
    to Christ. Now would be the time to start as the student after us will be
    following in our footsteps. I now realise how much easier it is to reach out
    as a student than as in the career field. In Vancouver, I have friends from
    my days in high school who are non-Christians, but in Ottawa, I have yet to
    meet someone who is unchurched aside from my co-workers, who are more mature
    in age and live separate lives with their families and friends.<br />
  </p>


  

<p><i>As a grad student who has frequent encounters with faculty members and
    grad students, as well as undergrad students, how do you see your role fit
    on campus in light of the changes going on in Ontario universities?</i></p>


  

<p><b>Nat:</b> To be honest, with the marks that I had coming into UT for grad
    studies, I honestly didn&#8217;t expect that God would open up the door for me to
    be at UT. After receiving my letter of acceptance, I know that God had many
    things in store for me. To tell you the truth, it hasn&#8217;t been an easy journey
    in grad school. The life of a grad student is not the same as an undergrad.
    I&#8217;m most thankful for UTCCF to have been there always in support of me through
    their love, and through prayer. But there are many overseas students who endure
    struggles much more different than what we (who live in Canada for many years)
    endure. They must struggle with English, to do well in school in order to
    maintain their status as a VISA student, and most often, their lives evolve
    around their research. </p>


  

<p>To answer the question of what I see my role on campus is, right now I know
    that I must focus on my graduate studies given that God has granted me to
    study here. At the same time, I hope to be more involved with the grad ministry,
    and to build strong bonds with my fellow classmates and professors. CCF is
    also a big part of me, and so, I will definitely support the Chinese Christian
    ministries. Most of all, I really hope to be a good witness for Christ in
    my graduate program, as many of them do not know Christ and may not have a
    concept of God. </p>


  

<p><i>As a student who have been in leadership position in a Chinese Christian
    fellowship, what implications do these changes on campus mean to the A/CCF
    on campus?</i>


    <b>Me:</b> Firstly, as anything I said earlier, my opinions reflect what I
    see or have experienced at UW only. UWCCF may be different than the A/CCF&#8217;s
    elsewhere because we average to approximately 100 people on a busy term, and
    it&#8217;s comprised of students from 2 different universities: WLU and UW. We also
    lead almost everything in English. Because of the changing environment/dynamics
    of the types of students are that our on our campuses, it would first mean
    that we need to be aware of such issues and people. At this time, I feel that
    UWCCF is already starting to prepare by taking care of the frosh in more effective
    ways. We also need to look for a bigger room soon to accommodate the increase
    of numbers in attendance. And for a campus fellowship to be known, we need
    to be an active presence on campus and to focus on reaching outwardly more
    so than inwardly-one example is to focus on evangelism instead of discipleship.
    Yes, I do agree that discipleship is important, but evangelism is extremely
    important as well. One example is that last term, CCF focused their programs
    on evangelism (and this term people are encouraged to bring a new friend every
    week), whereas the cell groups and prayer meetings were more focused on discipleship
    and accountability. As previous Campus Challenges have emphasised, we also
    need leaders to pass the torch along to the future generation of students.
    CCF may be one of the bigger fellowships at UW, and so we need to perhaps
    work together with the others on campus to be even more effective as one body
    in Christ and most definitely-to pray for our campuses, including for us to
    have the compassion and a heart for the people.</p>


  

<p> There are different groups to cater to on campus, there are not only the
    CBCs/non-Chinese (as we are more comfortable to reaching out to), but there
    are also the graduate students, and those who are Cantonese/Mandarin speaking
    as well.</p>


  

<p><i>What would you recommend CCF to do now to better position themselves?</i></p>


  

<p><b>Nat:</b></p>




<ul>


<li> Two key words that I would hope that every Chinese Christian group have are:
  Visibility and Prayer</li>


  

<li> The first aspect I want to stress is &#8220;Christian Visibility&#8221;.
  Most often, CCF can be so self-contained, sometimes becoming an entity of its
  own. I find that most often, CCF&#8217;s do not realizing what goes on beyond their
  Christian circle. While the whole society is changing, we are not keeping up
  with them. And we are definitely not equipping ourselves to be better warriors
  for Christ.</li>




<li>Christian Visibility is important because CCF is there on campus for the campus.
  I hope every Christian student recognize that. CCF is there on campus for the
  campus! It is NOT a support group for the Christian students. We should be more
  visible, much more than before, especially in times like these. To let the students
  to know that there is an absolute truth in this pluralistic environment. To
  let the students know that Jesus Christ loves them.</li>


 

<li>The second aspect I want to stress is &#8220;Prayer&#8221;. It is so
    easy to get burnt out when serving in our respective campus Christian fellowships.
    Trying to juggle with school and with serving God in the campus ministries
    is very tough. We always fall into the trap of &#8220;doing&#8221; things, rather
    than reflecting upon what we are doing, and why we&#8217;re doing it.</li>


  

<li> Instead, I really hope that every one of us who are part of our campuses
    would just stop what they are doing, and come before God in prayer. There
    is such a need for prayers for the campus. Do we honestly pray enough for
    our classmates, for our professors, for the campus as a whole?</li>


	</ul>


  

<p>I want to challenge all of you to think about your campus as a mission field.
    With any mission field, each missionary prepares their hearts to listen and
    to obey God&#8217;s guidance. Despite the fact that the mission is full of hardships,
    we learn to love those whom we come in contact with during the mission. We
    cannot do much for Christ if we aren&#8217;t close to Him in prayer, and it would
    be worthless if we were to serve without love for our mission field. </p>




<p><i>If there were one overarching idea that you would want the current students
  on campus to have as a result of this forum, what would it be?</i></p>




<p><b>Nat:</b> During the UTCCF winter retreat, our speaker Pui-Wing Wong (who
  is also a Waterloo alumni) challenged us to think about what sort of reputation
  do we as a fellowship portray to the rest of the campus. During Pui-Wing&#8217;s time,
  he shared that CCF had a reputation for their investigative bible studies. His
  sharing really made us think…</p>


  

<p>So what kind of mark do you want to leave on your campus?</p>




<p>
    The Campus Challenge is &#8220;You are here&#8221;, not only to challenge us
    to think about why we are here on campus now, but also to look to the future
    as well. I hope that through this whole weekend, we would all be more aware
    of what goes on in our campuses. I hope that through this forum, it will really
    challenge everyone to think about his or her positions on campus.
  </p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				<![CDATA[<b>Where are You, Lord?</b>
  

<p>Where am I in life? Here I am. The mid-point of existence&#8211;uncertain, unknowing,
    and wavering in my thoughts of life. Is this what university does to a person?
    Yes indeed, I am a student. ‘Frosh’ as they term it here in Ontario
    &#8211;one that is fresh to university life. The exhilaration of it all: the freedom
    of living apart from parental guidance, the friends you make, the fun you
    have (and the not-so-fun aspect: studying and exams) . . . eight months goes
    by just so quickly! And yet towards the end of my first year, an unsettling
    aurora hangs in mid-air. Why? </p>


  

<p>I wish I could proudly stand up and say that my life is as smooth as a sailboat
    sailing in the summer breeze. Without trials and challenges in my life however,
    I would be less dependent on God and more dependent on myself. Questions range
    from academics to petty issues in my life. On many occasions, God in His provision
    has answered my prayer requests. Relatively speaking however, they seem minor
    compared to the issues that I am currently facing. Especially knowing what
    God’s will is for my life. </p>


  

<p>I have asked this question before in my last year in high school, as I was
    uncertain whether I had the marks to get into Pre-Optometry at the University
    of Waterloo. You see, I had wanted to get into Optometry ever since I had
    my eye vision first checked in Grade 9 but I was not sure whether God wanted
    me to be there or not. At one point in Grade 12, I almost decided to quit,
    giving up on Physics 12, but by a miracle of God, I pulled through and the
    provincial examination marks surprised me. I did not think I had done well
    at all (as with my Chemistry 12 examination as well). Thus, I was accepted
    into Pre-Optometry. At that time, I felt that since I was in Pre-Optometry,
    then becoming an optometrist was also God’s will! I was also determined
    to prove the pastor in Waterloo wrong as he had confidently said that I would
    never get into Optometry many years back. </p>


  

<p>Now, I look back at my wrong assumptions. I do think I misled myself. What
    was God’s purpose originally for me? Did He place me in a new environment
    away from home, so that I can learn to be dependent only on Him? Because I
    seem to have refocused my priorities, my academic marks do not seem as important
    to me, yet I know they are the most important if I want to remain in my program.
    If I continue with the grades I have (to the point where I am unsure whether
    I pass or fail my genetics course), I will be removed from my program, by
    the university. It seems that I fare better in the faculty of Arts, as Psychology
    and English keep me interested and my marks seem to be higher in those areas.
    Yet, school seems secondary to me now that I have so many opportunities to
    tell others of Christ. I keep asking God: if Optometry really is not for me,
    then what is? </p>


  

<p>The future still lies ever so murky, but the haze of fog slowly lifts as
    each closed door from God leads to a new opportunity. However, fear stands
    in the way. Fear of failure and disappointment (not that I have not been disappointed
    many times already), fear of what will happen to me. Sometimes, passive thoughts
    of death run through my head: ‘Wish a car would run me over, then I would
    not have to face tomorrow,’ but I know that thinking those thoughts do
    not get me anywhere. Maybe just more depressed. During those times, verses
    such as John 14:1 or Matthew 6:25-34, do not help me refrain from wondering,
    or being depressed over my situation. </p>


  

<p>I should be rejoicing that I will be home in less than a week but ironically,
    I do not want to go back anymore. After settling in Waterloo, I have grown
    accustomed to the freedom I have. From past experience, once I return home,
    I will again be under ‘house arrest’ (meaning bare minimum freedom)
    and choices, such as attending which church I want to serve at, will be taken
    away from me. Not only so, I will not be seeing some of my friends for awhile.
    Many are graduating this term, my cell group leader is graduating from his
    master’s program after the summer term is over, and my friend (also in
    my cell group) may not be here until her graduating term (Winter 2000) due
    to her co-op program. All these people that touched my lives, I’ll be
    leaving behind. The ones I felt were encouraging role models in many different
    ways, the ones that shared the vision of the campus fellowship and studied
    various biblical truths with me, and the very same ones that accepted me for
    who I am even though I was merely a frosh. Now with all this, how can I leave
    Waterloo permanently before my studies are over? That is what my parents are
    strongly suggesting I do if I do not remain in my current program as it is
    less costly to study in British Columbia. Which means, the pressure on my
    academic marks is doubled: to stay in program and to be able to stay at the
    University Waterloo. </p>


  

<p>Powerless. A feeling that arises when I cannot take control of the situation
    I am in; the only way to rid it is to leave everything up to God. Sometimes,
    I do wonder if the reason I struggle so much is because the freedom I have
    is destroying me. I lack discipline, motivation and because of this, I tend
    to enjoy procrastinating in the sin of laziness. God knows this as much as
    I do; yet I have such a hard time concentrating on my schoolwork. When it
    comes to being powerless of what is happening around me in regards to the
    Chinese Christian Fellowship (CCF) I am somewhat involved in, I feel even
    more helpless and hopeless. With conflicts in CCF that I cannot clearly discern
    as being spiritual at this time or not, I am easily frustrated and drained
    because no one is doing anything about the problems. It seems to be that what
    they say is merely all words, no actions. Training seems to be an area CCF
    seems to lack, and according to Campus Crusade for Christ, prayer, evangelism,
    and training (PET) are three of the most important elements a Christian ministry
    should have. I have been asked to join committee but I have declined many
    times, the ‘feeling’ like I am supposed to is just not there. Campus
    Crusade for Christ would rebut that feelings and emotions will waver and one
    cannot be dependent on them. Sometimes I wonder though, was that a wrong decision?
    I justify myself by saying my marks are not steady nor stable, my parents
    are against the idea, and definitely I do not see myself as qualified to serve
    as there are so many more mature and older people that are most likely more
    experienced. If these seem like feeble excuses even to me, what about to God?
  </p>


  

<p>These, amongst many other things in my life trouble me. Do not get me wrong,
    ironically, I am generally content with life. There is not almost a single
    day where I do not forget to thank the Lord for the sunshine He has provided
    (as compared to Vancouver), nor the freedom and experiences that I get to
    enjoy while I am here. No, I do not take life as a student for granted. However,
    the question that still concerns me the most is ‘What is God’s will
    for me, for my life?’ It seems to be an endless search for the answer
    to that question but I trust that someday in due time, God will reveal the
    answer to me just as long as I keep trusting Him. Where are you, Lord? </p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				<![CDATA[<b>Proverbs 3:5-6 </b>
  

<p align="left"><i>&#8220;Trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not
    on your own understanding; in all your ways, acknowledge him and he will make
    your paths straight.&#8221; </i>
  </p>


  

<p align="left">I had memorized Proverbs 3:5-6 (NIV) as a youth, but I had no
    idea how it would apply to me. Actually, I didn&#8217;t even know what the verse
    meant. It was just a &#8220;good&#8221; verse to remember because everyone else
    knew it and I&#8217;m sure I got something in return for memorizing it: a sticker,
    a bookmark, etc. Now, I can thank God for showing me what it means, through
    life experience! </p>


  

<p>Second year at the University of Waterloo. Looking back, I can say that it
    seemed more stable than first year, but it was just as much work in terms
    of academics, if not more. Adjusting to university life, especially when you&#8217;re
    away from home, took a year for me. I learned from the mistakes I made as
    a frosh. I learned that cramming doesn&#8217;t work as well as it did in high school,
    that sleep is essential if you want to put effort into studying in the afternoons
    (instead of napping to make up for the time lost at night) and also to be
    able to wake up for church and not fall asleep during sermons, that skipping
    class really doesn&#8217;t do you any good&#8211;unless you know what you are doing,
    and that your own cooking is three times as good as campus food&#8211;even if you
    don&#8217;t know how to cook! </p>


  

<p>Fall 1999: a term of confusion, and decisions. The fall term began as a fresh,
    new start. I settled into an apartment, which I shared with a fellow CCFer
    and began the habit of studying in the DC, then DP&#8211;the quiet, non-CCF library.
    I&#8217;m glad that I didn&#8217;t have resnet; I only had limited hours and a slow connection
    speed. Yet, the computer and my inviting bed always tempted me, so that is
    why I relocated. Thank God that my place is so much closer (and warmer because
    most of the journey is indoors) than if I had to walk from residence. Despite
    my efforts to retain and understand what the professors tried to &#8216;teach&#8217; me,
    I was still in a big mess, especially with organic chemistry. Oh boy. &#8220;Oh
    boy&#8221;, is the very least of it&#8211;just ask other people who have taken it.
    Either you naturally get it, or you don&#8217;t. Nothing in-between. It was then
    that I truly questionned where I was going next. </p>


  

<p>My housemate constantly heard me sighing I&#8217;m sure, constantly wondering whether
    I was in the right program. I started doubting myself, and tried to obtain
    people&#8217;s opinions around me. Some confidentally told me that I was at UW for
    one reason: to become an optometrist. If God opened that door for me in high
    school, then I should keep aiming for my goal. My good friend also encouraged
    me to stay in the program so that we could aim for our dreams together. I
    really admire her. She doesn&#8217;t give up, even though she may not be excelling
    in her courses either. She also has a plan B that is related to her field
    of study, but she continues to work hard to reach for plan A. </p>


  

<p align="center"><i>&#8220;Trust in the Lord with all your heart . . .&#8221;</i></p>


  

<p align="left">Towards the end of the term, I was pulled into two directions.
    I started thinking of a possible future in English (yipes, the faculty of
    arts! =\). But with a pursuit in arts, my parents had previously told me that
    I would have to go to SFU instead, which I didn&#8217;t want. I decided to wait
    for my marks to see whether I was able to pull up my science GPA. Admist this,
    I was praying. Harder than ever. </p>


  

<p>Winter 2000: This is where Proverbs 3:5-6 comes in. At Waterloo, the school
    term begins before marks are released from the previous term. I was still
    registered in the pre-optometry program and began another term with my science
    courses, and urgh, organic chemistry. Two weeks in, I decided to back out
    of that course and decided to take an arts course for fun (I barely passed
    the first organic chemistry, and I wasn&#8217;t about to fail another course). I
    think I was only taking 3 sciences like the previous term. </p>


  

<p align="center"><i>&#8220;. . .and lean not on your own understanding; . .
    .&#8221; </i></p>


  

<p>After bouncing the idea of going into RPW off my parents, they didn&#8217;t persist
    on insisting me to transfer to SFU. I was pleasantly surprised. One day, I
    decided to see the arts advisor to ask for er, advice? Actually, I don&#8217;t even
    remember how I ended up in his office. At that point, I think I (had already?)
    found out that my previous term marks weren&#8217;t all that great in the sciences.
    However, I did quite well in the 2 arts courses I took (&#8216;A&#8217; range). He told
    me that if I was to switch into English, I would be able to do so without
    any problems, and best of all, every credit to date will be able to be transferred
    (normally students start off with a clean slate), so I would be going into
    arts as a third-year student with a high average in arts. On top of that,
    I had already met the requirements and pre-requisites in getting into my program
    without having to take extra time to make-up for any missing credits. Throughout
    the first and part of my second year, I had taken arts courses merely as electives,
    some of which were &#8220;recommended&#8221; as part of the pre-optometry program;
    others were merely taken out of interest sake. Additionally, in the faculty
    of arts, one is must fulfill two groups of requirements on top of your program
    requirements; upon the completion of the winter term, I would have already
    fulfilled more than half! </p>


  

<p>I decided to change all my courses (except human physiology) to art courses.
    Funny that I decided to see the advisor on that particular day, for it was
    the last day to make changes&#8211;I wasn&#8217;t even aware of that! The science advisor
    finalized it by signing the form. I decided to forget about studying for the
    OAT (the optometry admission test) and just write it (because it was unrefundable).
    Turns out, I achieved average in my overall sciences and a little less for
    overall average. Oh well, I didn&#8217;t study for it. I viewed my winter term as
    a term of transition. If I did very well in my one science course and only
    fair in my arts courses, then I would reconsider continuing my pursuit in
    the sciences. </p>


  

<p align="center"><i>&#8221; . . .in all your ways, acknowledge him . . .&#8221;
    </i></p>


  

<p>Throughout the term, I was constantly praying and seeking answers. Yet, even
    then, what happened on the day when I saw the advisor was more than a coincidence.
    I don&#8217;t believe in coincidences or luck for that matter. Additional to prayer,
    I needed to do my part in doing my best and trying my hardest, which meant
    I needed to keep up with my courses = studying. Before I knew it, midterms
    came around yet, the results didn&#8217;t discourage me. Instead, I kept working
    to improve with the hopes that I would pull up my GPA by the end of the term,
    and that I would exit the my current program with dignity (ie. taken off of
    conditional standing). The final part of the term came and went. Final examinations
    were written, and I impatiently waited in anticipation for the results to
    see how well (or poorly as usual) I did. I had to wait for 1 month! Such a
    slow system; at UBC/SFU, students can find out their marks almost right away
    through telereg (or something similar to that using a touch-tone phone). </p>


  

<p>Alas, my marks came back after everyone else got theirs! I was very happy
    to see that the human physiology course was my best science course thus far,
    but compared with the rest of my arts courses, it was still the worst of them
    all. Maybe my strength has been in arts all along? The marks are encouraging
    to say the least. I am off conditional standing and I could continue with
    pre-optometry. </p>


  

<p>Another incident caused me to discredit concidences and luck, and to thank
    God instead. When I tried to pre-register in for the pre-optometry program
    (as the acceptance decision was not made yet) for the fall term, the same
    advisor would not allow me to register for all arts courses and 1 science.
    First, she looked at my pre-registration form and asked why I wanted to take
    so many arts courses, and I said that I was planning to switch into arts.
    She looked at me in disbelief and asked, &#8220;Are you still in good standing?&#8221;
    Probably thinking that I wasn&#8217;t, I replied, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; She was shocked.
    Her face told it all. I could picture her thinking, &#8220;What&#8217;s that crazy
    girl doing? She&#8217;s in good standing, and yet she&#8217;s switching from such a prestigous
    program into the faculty of arts? The faculty where &#8216;everyone&#8217; looks down
    upon?&#8221; But afterall that, she told me that even if I wanted to, I wouldn&#8217;t
    be able to take all arts, and 1 science because 2 sciences are mandatory to
    remain in the program. I was very surprised, because I suddenly realized that
    she made a mistake when she signed my course changes form at the beginning
    of the term for I only had 1 science. I was disappointed, but I filled out
    a &#8216;dummy&#8217; form with all sciences (she even made me take a lab with a course,
    but my friend didn&#8217;t have to when she registered). I think the advisors there
    are a l&#8217;il mixed-up. </p>


  

<p align="center"><i>&#8220;. . .and he will make your paths straight.&#8221;
    </i></p>


  

<p>About making this path straight. Well, it&#8217;s not like I know for certain where
    God is leading me. However, at this point, I&#8217;ve been accepted into RPW at
    UW, and the past circumstances, including my marks, seem to have paved a direction
    for me. I do know that if I continue to trust Him, in hindsight, I will definitely
    see the how the &#8216;path&#8217; became &#8216;straight.&#8217; I cannot tell you that this choice
    to pursue a degree in English is the path that I will continue to follow.
    However, I trust that with each closed door, there is an open one with a window
    of opportunity inside. </p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				<![CDATA[<b>&#8220;Here I am. Send me.&#8221; </b>
  

<p>Context: Excerpt of my application for a missions project in British Columbia.
    <br />
    Update: I got accepted to the project but not for the job position, thus I
    rejected their acceptance.</p>


  

<p><i>&#8220;29. Explain your reasons for wanting to be a part of this project.
    Include specific goals and objectives.&#8221; </i></p>


  

<p>To be honest with you, I had no intention of applying for any missions project
    this year. Even after a couple of people from my home fellowship decided to
    apply for the OEX project, which I was slightly interested in a few years
    back, I did not give missions a second-thought. However, a couple weeks ago,
    the e-mailer for CC at our campus sent out an e-mail announcing its new website.
    Out of curiosity, I clicked on the link and eventually somehow ended up at
    the Project website. I ended up reading through the descriptions for all of
    the Projects and sent an ICQ message to my sister telling her that she should
    consider the TO or Vancouver Projects since she was looking for a job and
    also because I know she likes ministry related events. A day passed and all
    of a sudden, something piqued my interest in reconsidering what I passed along
    to my sister. I decided pray and ICQed a few people that I trusted, including
    a friend who went on the Sonrise Project last year, a couple of pastors, and
    my parents and asked their opinions about applying to go on short-term missions.
    Admittedly, I had selfish motives for wanting to go on this Project in Vancouver.
    My first reason was because the job offers seemed to be so relevant to what
    I wanted to do in my future career. Secondly, I wanted to work near my home,
    and lastly, because of my positive experience at the HQ in 1998, I had always
    wanted to work for Campus Crusade again. </p>


  

<p>The second reason soon fizzled as I learned that I would have little to no
    free time to visit my friends at home or stay with my family as the Project
    would occupy a participant’s time almost 24/7. I would also be giving
    up 4 months to spend time away from my closest friends in Ontario. I was discouraged,
    but many people were already praying for me. A couple of years ago, when I
    spoke to my parents about OEX, they were quite against the idea of me traveling
    to a “foreign” country and doing missions, but this time surprisingly
    enough, my parents even encouraged me to apply! Well, I was reluctant but
    began to pray about applying. During reading week, I kept putting it off using
    the excuse that my credit card was upstairs and so I was lazy to submit my
    application. However, during my last weekend in Ottawa, I was bombarded with
    reminders by God. I can only say that they were by God as only He knew what
    I was struggling with-stepping out of my comfort zone and having courage to
    obey. </p>


  

<p>What was there to obey? Throughout the weekend, each program I attended focused
    on evangelism. On Saturday night, our fellowship had a workshop focusing on
    evangelism. During service on Sunday, the pastor switched from talking about
    hell (the past couple of weeks) to why Christians should evangelize, with
    special focus on peer/relational evangelism. The sermon and response song
    were entitled, “People need the Lord”. The worship songs reflected
    the need to tell and change the world including one inspired from Isaiah 6:8
    which says, “Here am I. Send me!” Throughout the service, I kept
    questioning myself, “Am I willing?” By the end of it, I confided
    in my closest friend and told him that I might not be returning to Ottawa
    in the summer. Class 401 (a series of “classes” based on ideas from
    a church in the States) continued to illustrate the various methods of evangelism
    and how to detect smokescreens (or answering objections). With a burden in
    my heart, upon returning home, I immediately took my wallet downstairs and
    submitted my application fee. </p>


  

<p>Although God may not want to send me this year to Vancouver for missions,
    I do know that, like my first year in university, I need to step out of my
    comfort zone again. Whether through missions or not, I have the responsibility
    to bring the Good News to my friends and peers. By applying to this Project,
    I have already taken a step of faith and left the rest to God. God willing,
    although I will sadly depart from my dear friends in Ontario in May, I will
    have something exciting and rewarding to look forward to: 4 months to stretch
    me spiritually, taking me out of my comfort zone, and perhaps even being able
    to reach my lifetime goal of personally leading a person to Christ. I know
    that the people I have shared my experience with are also praying for and
    with me. I, too, continue to pray. </p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				<![CDATA[Many impressions that
are etched in my memories seem to involve deeply with the people surrounding CCF
and church. As much as I may want to deny the impact that the people of CCF have
has on me, I must admit that even though they may not be serving in a leadership
position, their passion for God leads them to be serving anyhow, by serving others.
Sure, I am not as attached to CCF as some CCFers (hey, I'm only a member for the
sole reason of voting), and yes, there are hurtful experiences with some people
there, but the good seems to outweigh the bad (when I ignore the bad).


<p> The (CCF) people who&#8217;ve been a part of my life:
</p>



<p>
<i>Frosh Year</i>
</p>



<ul>
  

<li><b>Pastor Tim</b>: I met Pastor Tim once in 1997 at some Missions Conference
    held by all CAC&#8217;s in Canada. He knew my youth pastor from BAC from way back.
    I remember we were playing some game and he said, &#8220;You&#8217;re playing @$$hole!&#8221;
    and I thought to myself, &#8220;What kind of pastor swears?!&#8221; Not to mention he
    said to me, &#8220;You&#8217;re not going to make it into Optometry.&#8221; (ouch). He definitely
    isn&#8217;t like any other pastor I&#8217;ve ever known (in a good sense)! My pastor at
    BAC somehow told me that KWCAC had some free shuttle service from the airport
    (which doesn&#8217;t exist), yet when I e-mailed Pastor Tim, he offered to pick
    me up from Pearson :). To this very day, I&#8217;m very thankful for him (even though
    I proved his statement right about Op) and has over the years, showed me that
    pastors are just normal people (instead of people that you only see up on
    the pulpit on Sundays).

<p>
  </p>

</li>



<li><b>Dylan Lum and Amy Tung</b>: In Grade 12, those two kept in contact with
    me by answering my many questions through e-mail about CCF. Ha, and to think
    that I thought CCF was going to be in Cantonese (hence the name, <i>Chinese</i>
    Christian Fellowship)..Dill is the least likely Chinese =). It occured to
    me once that perhaps Dill and Amy were going out then because Dill talked
    about his girlfriend (back then) and well, Amy seemed to be quite involved.
    I didn&#8217;t realise they were part of the same committee ;). From our first discussions
    in my frosh year about our differing views on disciplining children and homosexuals
    serving in the church, I&#8217;ve come to see how much he&#8217;s grown in God by the
    time he graduated.</li>



<p>
  </p>



<li><b>Alan Liu</b>: &#8220;Hi! I&#8217;m Alan!&#8221; I distinctly remember him as being one
    of the first ones to introduce himself to me during the first CCF Praise and
    Worship night at KWCAC. I also remember him saying that he was from Missisauga,
    but no, didn&#8217;t attend Pastor Isaac&#8217;s church (MCAC) but rather, MCBC. Through
    him, I met others like Will Wong and Yee-Min Cha.</li>



<p>
  </p>



<li><b>Sandra Cheng</b>: She was the leader of my worship team (who I think
    also had Daisy and some others). Not only was she passionate for God, she
    truly had the gift of caring (and still does to this very day). I remember
    that even though she was on her work term, she would call me to see how I
    was doing as a frosh.</li>



<p>
  </p>



<li><b>Ken Chung</b>: During one Sunday after a CFC service, he invited me over
    to Shakespeare and made some noodles for lunch, while watching Veggie Tales
    (Madame Blueberry)! I didn&#8217;t know him well then, but soon got a chance to
    just hang out w him and Andrew Ma in V1. I ended up watching Martial Law and
    Buffy <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f610.png" alt="😐" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> every week during dinner with him and Eric Fung (the fruitopia label
    collector :P).</li>



<p>
  </p>



<li><b>Karen Leung</b>: Although she was not a UWCCF goer (she was a Guelpher),
    Karen came to visit UWCCF many times during my first year. I was struck by
    her hospitality and kindness in outreaching to people she didn&#8217;t know. During
    one thanksgiving weekend, she even invited me over to her place (in Guelph)
    for some Thanksgiving dinner&#8230;.I had to decline because it was too far away
    (but PT invited us!).</li>



<p>
  </p>



<li><b>Larry Kim</b>: Although a quiet-to-himself sort, he didn&#8217;t hesitate to
    offer to walk me, a stranger, home to res after seeing me at the old twinkle
    lab (surrounding the MC Red Room) to check my e-mail and to contact my friends
    back home after CCF one night, even though he lived in the complete opposite
    direction. From his actions, I soon realised that many brothers made sure
    that their sisters were walked home safely back then.</li>



<p>
  </p>



<li><b>Alan Wong, Andrew Ma, and Jason &#8220;Sponge&#8221; Chan</b>: Alan taught me the
    basics of UNIX and how to navigate through that OS, whereas Andrew, he looked
    my age and got me addicted to Atomic Bomberman&#8211;my rep as a found-out-hacker
    (netbus) stems from Mr. Ma and Sponge&#8230;netstat, pings, netbus, trojans, tracert&#8230;it&#8217;s
    amazing what I learn in 8 months from these people (the more productive end
    of it is web development)!</li>



<p>
  </p>



<li><b>Natalie Wong, Carey Wan, Henry Chen, and cell-group</b>: The female engineer
    who&#8217;s been teased a lot&#8230;but Nat is also quite caring in her own l&#8217;il way.
    I think to this very day, she still sees me as a l&#8217;il girl (I&#8217;ve grown up
    a bit now Nat :T). She and Carey were in my cell group and both of them took
    time to talk and help me out whenever I needed it. The rest of my cell group
    showed me what love meant (ex. Kenneth Lam, Samuel Ooi, Tom Cheng(?), Alan
    Wong&#8230;.). Henry, he the funny one. We&#8217;d have endless discussions about fundamental
    views of Christianity, played Tetrinet til late (I think he was the one who
    introduced it to me), and provided me places to study (like his office/basement/etc.).
    I think we disagreed more than we agreed on many issues, but I learned from
    him lots; his walk with God affected mine greatly. Henry and Nat and I went
    to the Ontario Science Centre one day and we all got in free because I had
    Science World membership :)!</li>



<p>
  </p>



<li><b>Wayne Pau and Matthew Mark</b></li>


  : Wale?! I donno why Wayne started to call me that, but to this very day, if
  I hear that name, it&#8217;s usually in reference to me and I know it&#8217;s Wayne. Shortly
  after, Matt kept calling me Beast (for what?! o_O ), which soon stemmed to everything
  else as being &#8220;beast&#8221; including Clara&#8217;s eating habits. Near the end of first
  year, not only did Matt help me buy a dresser from
  Ikea (near his place) for me to move into TJ&#8217;s place, but he also came down one day from TO to deliver me 2 &#8220;dj rumble wale CD compilations&#8221; and surprised me with some bubbletea! That was my very
  FIRST bubbletea from Canada &#8230; (I&#8217;ve had it in HK). I was still sleeping (how
  embarassing..hehe, to open the door to see Matt with my &#8220;sleepy&#8221; look)&#8230;but
  it was nevertheless, something I remember =).

<p>
  </p>



<li>CCF event-community outreach: While some people went to Oasis (a homeless
    shelter), a group of us went to Kitchener to Anchor House, a Christian(?)-runned
    Young Offender&#8217;s House. Played foosball with a few of the youth (they&#8217;re in
    there to serve as a sentence for various offences as a substitute for jail
    time) and my eyes were opened that night. One teen, &#8220;J&#8221;, while joking around
    and in good spirits, as soon as his mother was mentioned (or seen), I caught
    a glimpse of his bitterness and a hurting&#8230;and was saddened at how much emptiness
    was reflected in his eyes, and how less of an impact that we had on him because
    we were only visiting once, never again to do anymore follow-up or to build
    any deeper friendships with these lost teens.</li>


</ul>


<i>Second Year</i>


<p>
Vince(?) or asked me to serve at the Welcome Table. Through that ministry, I was able to put more faces to names, and got to know more of the other brothers and sisters in CCF. That year, I moved into WCRI and lived with TJ.
</p>



<ul>


<li><b>Tai Jing Moyung and Daniel Hsueh</b>: I&#8217;ve seen their ups and downs (and had the honour and privilege to attend their wedding last year!), but they (along with Carey, and other Master&#8217;s students) showed me that Masters is a quite a suffering and enduring process. In a sense, TJ was like a big sister and Daniel had an influence in where I am today; he was one of those who supported my decision to switch into RPW, an &#8220;elite&#8221; program, he said and he respected people like Eva Chan who was already in it.</li>



<p>
</p>



<li><b>Kevin Ho</b>: I don&#8217;t think I knew him until one day, Ken Chung drove himself, Kev, and I for dinner at China Gardens. Shortly after, he asked for my opinion on choosing a set of frames and thus, I believe our friendship began there. I remember him even bringing a Cha Siu Bao over for me once for lunch :).</li>



<p>
</p>



<li><b>Benjamin Abbas</b>: I looked up to him (Sponge and Jen Mok) as &#8220;Artsies&#8221;. There weren&#8217;t many people in Arts during those days, and with the many questions of switching into an Arts program were mainly answered and supported by Ben. He also saved me from some strange stalkers a few times. I also had the chance to serve together on commitee and as Sunday School teachers. I really appreciated our friendship over the next few years.</li>



<p>
</p>



<li><b>Vonne Young</b>: I think my see-lai-ness started to become evident on our trip to New York/New Jersey together. I didn&#8217;t know Vonne very well, until somehow, we became travelling companions. I don&#8217;t know how that even came to be, but I thank God for enabling me to get to know her better through this trip, providing me with not only a friend, but a accountability/prayer partner over the years. hahah, $1 pens at the Disney store and my, oh my, to save a few dollars, we walked sooo much! :).</li>


</ul>


<i>Third Year</i>


<p>
I ended up serving in committee for 1 term and began to teach Sunday School at KWCAC. Ben and I taught together and although I did not feel that I was made for teaching Sunday School, teaching the teens taught me greater patience and love. And, from then on, I&#8217;ve come to love the people that I get a chance to share an hour with every Sunday and have the privilege to take part in their spiritual journeys (ex. Wallace becoming a Christian at TC!). And to this very day, although I&#8217;ve shared them with others like Daisy, Tania, Josiah, Feng, I wouldn&#8217;t trade them for any other group :).

<ul>


<li><b>Sherwin Chim, Gabe Chang, Winnie Wong, Dylan Lum, Benjamin Abbas, Abraham Wong</b>: Okay, I admit, Gabby wasn&#8217;t exactly a committee member, but his dedication and willingness to serve by taking cell groups and prayer meetings under his wing showed his passion for God and for people. I didn&#8217;t know who Sherrie was when he ran for committee, but I&#8217;m glad that I got to know him through our term serving together. The insights that they, along with Winifred, Dill, Pork and Ben, gave and the weekly prayer meetings that we had really shaped up my walk with God. Many nights, Pork helped me with my Flash website, and through serving as co-DL, his questions often challenged me into thinking deeper (&#8220;am i doing this for love or obligation?&#8221;) and desiring to live God&#8217;s word. The committee members met outside of administrative and CCF events, which really helped build greater accountability and deeper friendships.</li>



<p>
</p>



<li><b>Benjamin Cheung</b>: I got to know him through my late nights in the Twinkle lab. His accounting friends would all be working on something, while I worked away on my essays. Our discussions on certain moral questions (e.g. is lying wrong? what about killing?) led into late night chats and massive research for biblically supported answers, but I&#8217;ve learned a lot from them as well. Sometimes, Benjamin reminds me of a little kid&#8230;I had tons of fun when he was around. Him and Johnny Wong, I&#8217;ve sadly lost in touch with&#8230;but I still have Ben&#8217;s Point of Grace CD that I have yet to give back to him when I see him&#8230;</li>

<i>Fourth Year</i>


<p>
Fourth year was a mess relationally. Had troubles beginning in the summer with more than one relationship, which ended up taking away any trust, sensitivity, compassion I had for anyone in general&#8230;one friend even wanted to commit suicide (thank God he didn&#8217;t), my cousin went missing; it was a rough summer (and result, year). I withdrew from many people, not trusting and not knowing who was against me. Miranda Kong isn&#8217;t a CCFer but I thank God for her anyhow, for trying to reach out (for what purpose I don&#8217;t know but she persisted) and for Garvin Lee for the wisdom and maturity he has shown through our conversations, although I&#8217;m sure he doesn&#8217;t think so or realise it.  Funny, I look back now, and although my walk with God dwindled for awhile, the experience prepared me to be patient with people that would have formerly driven me insane within a matter of weeks.
</p>



<p>
Sadly, I can&#8217;t remember anything good about CCF that year; merely a blip in my memory.
</p>



<p> <i>Fifth Year</i>
</p>



<p> I don&#8217;t know Andy Yu or Wayne Chang very well at all, but these two people
  started coming back out and serving in CCF after seeing them maybe once in first
  year, and I&#8217;m encouraged. I&#8217;m encouraged to see them because in first year,
  for awhile, I kept seeing Wayne in the caf and asking him how he&#8217;s doing, noting
  that I didn&#8217;t see him at church etc, and his reason would be, &#8220;I slept in.&#8221;
  to the point where I just gave up&#8230;but I&#8217;m glad that others continued to minister
  to them.
</p>



<ul>


<li><b>Jeff Chang</b>: I can&#8217;t remember how I met him, but I do remember thinking that he had so much energy, much like a frosh at NSR. He made it at point to make sure my first term of my last year was one of my better terms (or the &#8220;best year&#8221; in his words). He challenged me by asking questions relating to his search for a better relationship with God. He succeeded in slowly drawing me back to CCF. His willing to serve by spending late night working on Insight, on the retreat handbook, by committing to help out with MCCF really reminded me of the fire for God that such young Christians have, and that older Christians should continue to have!</li>



<p>
</p>



<li><b>Jason Wong</b>: Jason literally helped me pass my cs230 algorithms course. He spent countless hours trying to explain and walk through logic with me to successfully progam and complete my assignments. Many times, I would feel on the verge of giving into sleep, but Jason would press to continue onto completion. His heart for God is shown through helping others. To a lesser degree, but still important, other people whom I&#8217;ve asked for help that&#8217;s taken some time out to help someone they barely know include: Sam and Tim Ng, Joseph Wong, Waiki Lee, Dave Tse, Dan Tey and my other friends Eric Liu, Jeffrey Kwong, and Terence Wong.</li>



<p>
</p>



<li><b>Mike Mak</b>: I actually don&#8217;t know this guy. Like some say, his quiet nature in large unfamiliar groups, makes him look quite intimidating. However, I got to see the other side of him one day when Waiki, or rather Mike, kept repeating, &#8220;I Love You&#8221; on Waiki&#8217;s ICQ. He brought a smile to my face especially when at first I thought Waiki&#8217;s account was hacked, but soon learnt, with Kevin Ho and Pastor Tim&#8217;s help, that it was Mike =). Although I have yet to take up his offer and invitations to Westcourt events this term, his caring nature for others is evident through his actions, which I only attrtibute to God.</li>



<p>
</p>



<li><b>Joseph Wong</b>: I owe him a bubbletea, and much more. Not only did he find me a job in the summer, but the small actions he does is reflective of the gentleman that he is and also reflective of how a brother should treat his sister in Christ. His maturity (and immaturity at times :P) and his willingness to serve God whether in a leadership position or behind-the-scenes is thus reflected in him well.</li>



<p>
</p>



<li><b>Becky Chan</b>: I got to know Becky through our various conversations that we&#8217;d have. I think I&#8217;m drawn to Becky because of the tie she has to &#8220;home&#8221;, but she understands and similarly struggles with finding a fellowship to belong in&#8211;to call CCF &#8220;home&#8221;. During Winter Retreat, I had the chance to share with what&#8217;s on my mind with both Becky and Anna Chu.</li>



<p>
</p>



<li><b>Steve Wong, Daniel Lee</b>: Their company, especially during the times of studying at the SLC. I have to include Terence Wong here too, for he got me hooked on Daytona for a term while he made sure (and helped) me to stay focused on studying :).</li>


</ul>


And outside of CCF:


<ul>


<li><b>Jasmine Choi</b>: She cared for our friendship. Jasmine made sure that I didn&#8217;t stay mad at her whenever there was a reason to be&#8230;And, along with Joanna, they cared for the people around them. Noteably, she made sure that not only one of us, but both of us were okay.</li>



<p>
</p>



<li><b>Eunice Chiu</b>: She coerced me into being her god-sister, but I still love her. Over the past few months, I think she&#8217;s unknowingly drew out the love for others and the care that I have buried deep within me. Tears have been shed for her (yes, eunie!) and prayers have been said in earnest for God to take care of her. I think she&#8217;s a great part of my life now especially since she calls, like, everyday =) (and the days she doesn&#8217;t call, haha, you don&#8217;t want to know what she&#8217;s doing). I may not agree with her lifestyle, but she&#8217;s challenged me to live a life worthy of His calling in many ways more than one.</li>


</ul>


I know I&#8217;ve left out many. With over 186 UWCCFers that I&#8217;ve come in contact with over my 5 years here, it&#8217;s impossible to name them all. I would leave you with Philippians 1:3-6, but because that&#8217;s been overdone lately, I shall leave you with another. Jesus says in Matthew 5:3-10:


<blockquote>
   Blessed are the poor in spirit, <br />
       for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. <br />
    Blessed are those who mourn, <br />
       for they will be comforted. <br />
    Blessed are the meek, <br />
       for they will inherit the earth. <br />
    Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness,<br />
       for they will be filled. <br />
    Blessed are the merciful, <br />
       for they will be shown mercy. <br />
    Blessed are the pure in heart, <br />
       for they will see God. <br />
    Blessed are the peacemakers, <br />
       for they will be called sons of God. <br />
    Blessed are those who are persecuted because of righteousness, <br />
       for theirs is the kingdom of heaven
 </blockquote>


Or as the Message translates it:


<blockquote>
You&#8217;re blessed when you&#8217;re at the end of your rope.<br />
With less of you there is more of God and his rule.<br />
You&#8217;re blessed when you feel you&#8217;ve lost what is most dear to you.<br />
Only then can you be embraced by the One most dear to you.<br />
You&#8217;re blessed when you&#8217;re content with just who you are&#8211;no more, no less.<br />
That&#8217;s the moment you find yourselves proud owners of everything that can&#8217;t be bought.<br />
You&#8217;re blessed when you&#8217;ve worked up a good appetite for God.<br />
He&#8217;s food and drink in the best meal you&#8217;ll ever eat.<br />
You&#8217;re blessed when you care.<br />
At the moment of being &#8220;careful,&#8217; you find yourselves cared for.<br />
You&#8217;re blessed when you get your inside world&#8211;your mind and heart&#8211;put right.<br />
Then you can see God in the outside world.<br />
You&#8217;re blessed when you can show people how to cooperate instead of compete or fight.<br />
That&#8217;s when you discover who you really are, and your place in God&#8217;s family.<br />
You&#8217;re blessed when your commitment to God provokes persecution. <br />
The persecution drives you even deeper into God&#8217;s kingdom.
</blockquote>
