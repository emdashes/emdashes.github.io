								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				I started this post when it was at the one-month countdown mark, but in reality, there&#8217;s only a few weeks left! <em>cue: panic</em><br />
Funny how the second-baby syndrome has already begun, even with pregnancy:</p>
<ul>
<li>haven&#8217;t taken many belly shots, despite knowing that my belly is bigger (and seems to sit lower) this time around</li>
<li>we haven&#8217;t decorated any rooms for this baby</li>
<li>the husband has shown up to only 1 or 2 midwife appointments so far, as opposed to the majority of them for Bean</li>
<li>I don&#8217;t know which week I am at unless I&#8217;m at my midwife appointment &#8211; I only know that there&#8217;s less than one month left</li>
<li>no shower or party planned for baby at the moment</li>
<li>I haven&#8217;t been as diligent in terms of diet in avoiding foods like cured meat (especially bacon) and&nbsp;soft cheese (but&nbsp;still do&nbsp;avoid raw fish)</li>
</ul>
<p>So I guess with only a month left, here&#8217;s <a href="http://goo.gl/forms/ZP1ovFBKC2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a poll for you: guess the baby&#8217;s gender, birthday, and time</a>!<br />
<iframe width="760" height="1050" src="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1O-Y-NkVvBPY1zak_nNA3TUN_91YswI4bG177AVsJF20/viewform?embedded=true" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0">Loading&#8230;</iframe><br />
While I don&#8217;t know the gender, here are some hints/observations &#8211; some of which are repeated <a href="http://her.happyhippos.ca/2013/07/boy-or-girl/">in an older post</a>&nbsp;(so I don&#8217;t <a href="http://her.happyhippos.ca/2013/07/its-a-baby/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">win again this time around</a>):</p>
<ul>
<li>My&nbsp;midwife says that&nbsp;boys&nbsp;have a tendency to come earlier than girls (more likely to have premature babies)</li>
<li>One of my midwives has&nbsp;told me that the majority of the babies she has delivered&nbsp;had a tendency to be born&nbsp;at night</li>
<li>While I originally wanted another hospital birth, I plan to start with a home birth this time around &#8211; just to prove that it&#8217;s perfectly fine to do so (contrary to family&#8217;s belief and comments, similar to their comments about midwives &#8211; vs OBs and other healthcare professionals)</li>
<li>This baby hiccups daily &#8211; at least 2-3 times a day, most often in the evenings</li>
<li>I can feel body parts jabbing at me daily &#8211; and can almost feel limbs like the heel, knee, and sometimes if I press enough, I feel like maybe the rib-like feeling are the toes</li>
<li>Sadly, I have given in&nbsp;to my body pain (right side pelvic / pubic bone pain) and have withdrawn from badminton (which incidentally ended 1 month earlier last time around) so I don&#8217;t aggravate it further</li>
<li>My belly seems to be lower and larger than when I was carrying Bean</li>
<li>All babies have historically arrived early from the mothers on&nbsp;my side of the family&nbsp;(mother, sister, aunts, cousins). My mom&#8217;s generation of babies (ie. my cousins)&nbsp;on average came 20 days early; my generation of babies came 12 days early (ie. my cousin&#8217;s/sister&#8217;s babies); Bean came 8 days early.</li>
<li>My original calculated date, before a medical review, was December 5, 2015, but ultrasounds and healthcare professionals now say the estimated due date is December 7, 2015</li>
<li>Bean has been praying for a <em>mui mui</em> (girl) almost daily</li>
<li><a href="http://her.happyhippos.ca/2013/07/baby-predictions/">People&#8217;s guesses last time around</a></li>
</ul>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				The leaves are starting to change colours and the squirrels in our yard are sporting bushier and whiter tails, a sign that summer is inevitably ending and that autumn is just around the corner. And with only less than three months to go, I am feeling largely uncomfortable &#8211; whether it&#8217;s from trying to avoid scratching two mosquito bites on the belly, all the baby movement, or me trying to find the sweet spot on the left side to fall asleep (because the left is optimal to get the baby in the right position); insomnia isn&#8217;t helped by the fact that I tend to accidentally fall asleep after lunch and dinner with Bean more often now so waking up at 2AM leaves me wide awake, one time until 730AM. Also had an interesting conversation with my dentist and hygienist the other day; when I mentioned having swollen gums, he pretty much estimated that over 50% of pregnant women get some form of gingivitis during their pregnancy and probably more don&#8217;t even know it or talk about it.<br />
Instead of a nesting urge, I&#8217;m finding that I want to make the most of my available time with Bean before I&#8217;m confined or stuck indoors for the winter months and before the arrival of another child. Then again, this year has been a year of finding time for myself in the evenings as well, whether it has been badminton, ASL classes, or drawing classes, perhaps knowing that I will not have time for that again for a while. I am a little worried that our family will have difficulty adjusting to this addition, especially since our little one, but we&#8217;re praying that the transition for everyone isn&#8217;t going to be too rough and to have wisdom on how to handle it best then.</p>
<hr />
In our news, we often catch Bean singing or counting to herself nowadays, with skipped lyrics, numbers, or letters, which makes it all the more amusing to listen to &#8211; especially when she sees multiples of one item, she just arbitrarily starts to count and assigns a number to it (e.g. 3 birds would be 1, 2, 3, 4 or 1, 2,3, 4, 5, 6 ducks).<br />
PS. Third trimester means that I can start eating more watermelon (don&#8217;t ask, because I don&#8217;t know why only 3rd trimester is okay but others aren&#8217;t per Chinese mom &#8211; likely related to it being a &#8220;cool&#8221; fruit)! Oh yeah, and it&#8217;s time to start on the raspberry leaf tea.		</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				<img class="alignright wp-image-4610 size-medium" src="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/1-WP_20150722_14_07_39_Pro-252x300.jpg" alt="Sonograph" height="300" width="252" srcset="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/1-WP_20150722_14_07_39_Pro-252x300.jpg 252w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/1-WP_20150722_14_07_39_Pro-768x916.jpg 768w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/1-WP_20150722_14_07_39_Pro.jpg 859w" sizes="(max-width: 252px) 100vw, 252px" /><br />
Gasp, can&#8217;t believe we&#8217;re already at the halfway mark! Bean has been such a distraction that I haven&#8217;t counted, Daddy isn&#8217;t as involved this time around at coming to midwife sessions and other appointments, and we&#8217;re just going with the flow (seems like typical second child syndrome!).<br />
This time, I had an inkling based on the sudden minor weight changes when I was tracking for my fitbit but I had continued to drink a few gulps of beer here and there because I just dismissed that gnawing feeling (guilty!). So, j.w finally went to the dollar store to buy a test to confirm (wow, a huge savings than buying from the pharmacy!). Compared to the last, the symptoms have been pretty consistent, with the exception that my feet feel like it&#8217;s pulsing (swollen?) all the time and everything is happening so much sooner:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nausea</li>
<li>Food stuck in gums near the teeth</li>
<li>Fatigue</li>
<li>Round ligament and groin pain (much sooner than first time but surprisingly, chiro visits seem to help!)</li>
<li>Abdominal pulling when lifting heavy things</li>
<li>Baby bump showing at 3 months instead of later (4-5?)</li>
</ul>
<p>Bean must know something is up (though a fried says it&#8217;s a phase even when you&#8217;re not expecting) because despite Daddy complaining the she wanted him all the time after our trip, that soon passed and now mommy is super-priority. If she&#8217;s around, she&#8217;s the one that&#8217;s Bean-appointed to buckle her in, sit beside her, hold her, play with her, change diapers, feed her (or assist), change clothes, do the bedtime routine., etc. Thankfully, she knows that Daddy is the one that takes her outside to play in the evenings.<br />
At first, I had wanted to find out about the gender for practical and prep reasons, but last night I changed my mind &#8211; because how am I going to keep it a secret from my husband and everyone else for another 20 weeks? The mystery is what makes it a fun surprise for everyone too. The ultrasound technician today was really patient, took many images for us to take home, and showed us a lot of detail, unlike the sonographer (at a lab well known for&nbsp; pregnancy ultrasounds) <a href="http://her.happyhippos.ca/2013/04/hiding-no-more/">who said it wasn&#8217;t for &#8220;entertainment purposes&#8221;</a>: the heart pulsing (amazing!), spine, hands, feet, eyes (the lens!)&#8230;she even said that sometimes you can see the baby pee if she ventures down there (and they just drink it all back, yum). She also explained to me that they&#8217;re the eyes for the radiologist, who actually provides an analysis and report to the midwife &#8211; and here I thought the technicians did that too! This time, I only drank around 750 ml of water an hour prior, as I couldn&#8217;t hold it for the session last time (didn&#8217;t help the tech was late). Thankfully, last time, in her empathy, she told me I was allowed to go for 7 seconds (HOW does one cut off pee after exactly 7 seconds especially if they have weak pelvic floor muscles?) and said that they didn&#8217;t actually require 1L of water to get good results but it was formally still required (and wondered at how they expected pregnant women told hold so much for so long) so I cheated this time around.<br />
I opted to go with another midwife practice this time around because they have the <a href="http://www.perinatalservicesbc.ca/ForHealthcareProviders/Resources/ConnectingPregnancy.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Connecting Pregnancy</a> group session program, which after attending one session, seems to serve as a good reminder of previous prenatal classes but best of all, it&#8217;s free! For one of the activities in the nutrition session, we were asked to shared what we have heard about eating during pregnancy and then discussed whether they were true or false. Most people were surprised and amused at the Chinese pre-cautions around avoiding watermelon (cooling food) until third trimester due to pre-term labour risk and avoiding spicy food, crustaceans, pineapple and mango (hot foods?) due to potential skin allergies that your future baby will develop.<br />
I have some crafting/sewing projects on the go (and in my mind) that I hope we&#8217;ll have time to finish before baby arrives, but we&#8217;ll see how well that works out and we&#8217;ll see if my nesting instinct kicks in this time around. I certainly don&#8217;t look forward to pre-washing and prepping baby clothes and gear as laundry isn&#8217;t exactly my forté (I tend to forget it in the wash so it doesn&#8217;t get to dry right away).		</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				Recently, we have had more friends around us getting engaged, married, and having babies, so to help the parents-to-be or my future self, I&#8217;ve compiled a list of memorable &#8220;freebies&#8221; that I remember signing up for or have heard about &#8211; I don&#8217;t remember which freebie sign-up gave me samples of bamboo wipes and nursing pads though.<br />
Before we start, here&#8217;s a tip: because you&#8217;re signing up for a lot of these programs online (and in store), you may be asked for an email address. I find that having a dedicated &#8220;baby&#8221; or &#8220;junk mail&#8221; email address really helps filter the baby-related items. If you don&#8217;t want samples to come to your direct address, you can also send it to your <a href="https://www.canadapost.ca/flexdelivery">FlexDelivery</a> (PO Box) address at a local Canada Post office.</p>
<ol>
<li>Gift Registries<br />
If you are considering signing up for a baby gift registry, there are a couple of options:</p>
<ul>
<li>Babies &#8220;R&#8221; Us: upon placing a few items on the registry <em>in store</em>, a bag of freebies/samples and coupons will be given to you. If I remember correctly, a 0-6 mo pacifier was in mine, and a BPA free bottle (which we didn&#8217;t really like &#8211; we preferred the Avent bottles in the end). <del>If you deliver on your submitted expected date (or your guess), they will give you a gift as well</del>.</li>
<li> Sears: apparently, if purchases are made from your registry with them, and <a href="http://her.happyhippos.ca/2013/07/baby-predictions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">if you guess the correct date of the baby&#8217;s arrival</a>, then <a href="http://www.giftregistry.sears.ca/gift/egrWgEn.jsp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">you get credit back for those purchases</a>. I didn&#8217;t know about this, or else I may have benefitted <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Work Benefits
<ul>
<li>Employee Assistant Programs: Through my employer&#8217;s employee assistance program, we got 3 books (A What to Expect book, a year one book for Daddy, and a board book), a Baby Einstein lullaby CD, <a href="http://www.snugglebugz.ca/baby-whoozit.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a mini Whoozit toy</a>, and some other generic literature</li>
<li>Health insurance and fitness credits: this covered a private ward for recovery after delivery, and also allowed me to buy a jogging stroller as well as a breast pump</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Brands<br />
Even though you may plan to breastfeed exclusively, you might need formula as emergency supply or even to give away to other expectant/new moms since formula actually costs a fair bit!</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.startwell.nestle.ca/en/user/register" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nestle Baby</a>: you need to select that you plan to formula feed to get the backpack with change pad I&#8217;ve been told, some formula, and maybe a bottle?</li>
<li>Enfamil: formula</li>
<li>Johnson &amp; Johnson used to give out a free travel pack of baby products if you request it from their contact form, but when I did, they sent me a voucher to claim one in store <del>(which I haven&#8217;t found a place that carries them yet), and when my sister inquired, she was just directed to healthyessentials.ca to request non-baby related samples</del>. You can now sign up for an account at <a href="http://www.healthyessentials.ca" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">healthyessentials.ca</a>, fill out your profile to say when you&#8217;re expecting and they will automatically give you a form to fill out so that they can send you the the voucher.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Stores
<ul>
<li><del>Shoppers Drug Mart: VIB &#8211; free pack of diapers (I actually received two, but it could be because the fine print said offer valid until Dec 31, 2012 so I emailed them about it; my sister only got a coupon for diapers, I think), a baby bib, and coupons for 1000 Optimum points for buying various products, like baby Tylenol, diapers, drinks and snacks. Be sure to opt in on Optimum emails as they seem to send diaper coupons every so often (my sister has gotten $8 off any size pack of diapers and some other freebie).</del> <strong>Update:</strong> they discontinued the program sometime near the end of 2016.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.sobeyspharmacy.com/bbh" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sobeys Baby Be Healthy</a>: free monthly vitamins up to a year (you just need to go once a month), reuseable bag, a couple of Size 2 Compliments brand diapers<del> &#8211; these perks may only be given to you if you sign up in store (at the pharmacy)<br />
</del>Update: I was able to sign up online and get a small gift bag in store, and this time it contained a package of Huggies Little Snugglers newborn diapers!</li>
<li>Thyme Maternity: they may be affiliated with the Nestle program, but when I went on <a title="It’s about Thyme" href="http://her.happyhippos.ca/2013/05/its-about-thyme/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Customer Appreciation Day</a>, I think I got more than the standard package. Signing up to receive their emails will also alert you when they have a 1-item 50% off coupons.</li>
<li>Speaking of stores, if you&#8217;re already shopping for baby items online, some stores have referral codes so that you can get a new member discount (search on <a href="http://retailmenot.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">retailmenot.com</a> for online stores), or 5% off items that you have put in your cart but abandoned mid-transaction for whatever reason (e.g. Snugglebugz.ca). Oh, and be on the lookout for diaper coupons in newspaper flyer inserts like Redplum or P&amp;G, or online through sites like websaver.ca or P&amp;G (can&#8217;t remember if it was brandsampler.ca or brandsaver.ca) and remember to price it per diaper to see whether is sale is actually a good deal since each store has their own count of diapers per box (<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AoVtPmnZqKqFdEEzWk1zU01WX0Q2OWpMenVEeTZQd2c&amp;usp=drive_web#gid=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a handy spreadsheet helped me keep a tally</a>)</li>
<li>For those out west, <a href="http://www.londondrugs.com/Baby-Welcome-Package/baby-pkg%2Cdefault%2Cpg.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">London Drugs</a> has a sign-up form that you can complete to get a package in-store (or shipped free with $200+ purchase).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Region&#8217;s resources
<ul>
<li>Our city&#8217;s library has a partnership with Zinio and <a href="https://www.rbdigital.com/kitcheneron/service/zinio/landing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">allows you to download magazines to keep</a>. They used to offer Today&#8217;s Parent, but now they have <a href="http://www.ecoparent.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">EcoParent</a> and Birthing magazines. One branch has a toy lending library that even allows you to borrow toys for free! (You can also get Today&#8217;s Parent for $1 an issue that&#8217;s mailed to your home if you&#8217;re an existing Rogers or Fido customer)</li>
<li>The Region of Waterloo has a <a href="http://chd.region.waterloo.on.ca/en/childFamilyHealth/Online-Prenatal-Program.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">free online prenatal program</a>. While I found in-class sessions helpful for answering questions and hands-on practice (e.g. massage techniques), this seems like a great refresher or prep resource.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Midwife offices<br />
And speaking of libraries, some midwife offices will have a lending library of books, DVDs, and even free samples from various companies (lansinoh/nipple and/or diaper rash cream, Today&#8217;s Parent magazines) or even an mommy-exchange box that may have gently used clothing for baby and mom-to-be!</li>
<li><strong>*Unverified*</strong> Baby Boxes: (<a href="https://babyboxcanada.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1</a>) and (<a href="http://www.babyboxco.com/blogs/news/all-about-ontario" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2</a>). Because my babies were born before these initiatives were offered, I don&#8217;t actually know if you will actually get a baby box; one of our friends did mention you have to complete a form and bring in a voucher to a physical place to get the box.</li>
</ol>
<p>Once the baby is born, you may wish to join free programs like (note: these examples may be specific to my area):</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="http://www.children.gov.on.ca/htdocs/English/topics/earlychildhood/oeyc/index.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Early Years Centres</a></li>
<li>Mom and baby programs or support groups, either through local <a href="http://on.evanced.info/kpl/lib/eventcalendar.asp?Lib=All" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">libraries</a>, churches (e.g. <a href="http://www.mops.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MOPS</a> or our local Salvation Army&#8217;s <a href="http://www.sapcrc.com/programs.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Parent-Child Resource Centre</a>) or find meetings or activities online, such as Life With A Baby (LWAB) or <a href="http://www.lllc.ca/lllc-kitchenerwaterloo-wednesday-pm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">La Leche League</a> (LLLC for breastfeeding support)</li>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				On Sunday morning, I woke up to more cramping than normal and went to the bathroom (BM) twice, and the second time, I discovered blood! For some reason, I figured it was normal (pre/early labour symptoms that could last for days) so around 6am, I took a Tylenol and a Gravol as the midwife had suggested prior so I could sleep. By 8am, I proceeded to tell j.w that I was skipping church because I was tired due to 2 hrs of lost sleep. In hindsight, I am glad that we did because that meant I was able to get more sleep than a typical Sunday, which prepared me for the night ahead.<br />
Throughout the day, we took it easy. I had some more menstrual cramping that would radiate from the back to the lower belly, and more blood. But, it was pretty manageable especially sitting on an exercise ball. I had an urge to go poo every so often, but only pee would come. As a &#8220;just in case&#8221;, we took some more maternity belly shots, and j.w made the postpartum bath that the midwives gave me, and I made some oatmeal in preparation for a &#8220;light snack&#8221; in the event that I went into labour early. We also walked to Sobeys, watched Children of a Lesser God, and re-learned Age of Discovery (board game). I also folded the last of the baby laundry that we had, and ate some Ribfest meat for lunch.<br />
As we finished the game, Mel and Jon (and Lillian) showed up at our door! Somehow, J.w forgot to warn them that I had pre-labour symptoms. Lo and behold, by the time I went to bed, I couldn&#8217;t really think about anything else except the pooing feeling that was coming every three minutes for about a minute, and no poo! (the morning cramping felt like every four minutes for a minute but I had brushed it off), though the warm shower seemed to be very soothing and served as a distraction before Mel urged me to time them.<br />
We paged the midwife and by the time she came, my water broke in a huge warm gush, like a water balloon had bursted, and she told me that I was fully dilated! (what! Whatever happened to taking a long time to dilate?) so we decided to try a home birth since the alternative was calling an ambulance and being transported to the hospital in case I had a baby enroute. But after an hour, there wasn&#8217;t much progress and the baby seemed to be in the wrong position so we rushed to the hospital for a OB consult.<br />
Now I know that pushing feels like straining while constipated. God knew that I was trying to avoid an epidural, so he must have given me no choice. Because my blood platelet count was low, so I couldn&#8217;t get one even if I wanted to&#8230;<br />
&#8230;He also knew that I didn&#8217;t want a C-section, and despite being transferred to the OR, a baby girl showed up close to 6am this morning (after pushing even when I didn&#8217;t feel a contraction, thanks to OB&#8217;s demands and assisted birth with salad tongs / forceps, and the head nurse&#8217;s encouraging words). Strangely enough, as intense as pushing was, the cutting and stitching felt more painful when the freeze was wearing off.<br />
Now, we&#8217;re all resting at the hospital and I&#8217;m on my Q10 posting this, so it isn&#8217;t as eloquent as my other posts (*note: edited on July 30)<br />
Best of all, I won <a title="Baby predictions" href="http://her.happyhippos.ca/2013/07/baby-predictions/">the guessing game </a><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><br />

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				<a href="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/wordcloud.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2178" alt="Baby word cloud" src="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/wordcloud.png" width="758" height="540" srcset="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/wordcloud.png 758w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/wordcloud-300x214.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 758px) 100vw, 758px" /></a><br />
Today marks the end of my 2.5 days of vacation before maternity leave officially starts! I had plans to sleep in, but sadly, every morning so far, I&#8217;ve woken up around 9 AM to extreme heat, pelvic pain, and an extreme urge to pee. I also make sure j.w gets up too, since he has to get to work. Actually, embarrassingly enough, when I have to go these days, I&#8217;ve learned that I shouldn&#8217;t delay or ignore the urge, so I jolt and bolt to the washroom (otherwise, I risk wetting my pants :|). This, paired with menstrual-like cramps on Monday, and what I suspect might be the &#8220;bloody show&#8221; in the last two days (though really it&#8217;s not really a one-time thing if that&#8217;s it), is perhaps a sign that D-day is coming sooner rather than later (D being delivery or doomsday, or both).<br />
I think most people had a good time at the baby shower, and it seemed that despite two different groups of people (Toronto and KW) with some age differences (from masters students to older married couples with and without a toddler in tow), people seemed to find conversations that they could engage in; I felt especially blessed to have that many friends and family who would come to pray for and with us. As I mentioned to another friend, everyone&#8217;s excitement is encouraging, and will likely help get me through labour (and the days where joy might not be as abundant)! Coincidentally, most of us ended up wearing blue or neutral / grey tops &#8211; perhaps a sign of the gender of the baby to come?<br />
And, maybe it is a boy. Afterall, we found out yesterday that for some reason,  bébé stops moving whenever Clare wants to touch it, even though it was moving throughout the evening! Actually, despite that D-Day seems to be looming in the near distance, this baby is still very active and doesn&#8217;t seem to be lacking room at all (contrary to literature), but the body parts that stick out seem a lot more prominent now; I&#8217;ve noticed this especially after eating watermelon.<br />
Anyway, here&#8217;s a tally (graph/chart) of the guesses, most of them are from the guests who came to the baby shower:<br />
<figure id="attachment_2176" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2176" style="width: 788px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/baby.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-2176" alt="baby guesses" src="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/baby.png" width="788" height="472" srcset="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/baby.png 788w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/baby-300x180.png 300w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/baby-768x460.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 788px) 100vw, 788px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2176" class="wp-caption-text">Prediction chart of baby&#8217;s timing and gender</figcaption></figure><br />
With the official due date being July 30, it seems like July 28 is a popular date that people are guessing, with more guesses for a boy over a girl.		</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				As much as I prefer smaller and intimate gatherings, we can&#8217;t deny the many friends and family members who have supported us through this pregnancy. One of the questions that we constantly get asked is whether we know it&#8217;s a boy or girl. Well, that&#8217;s one question that I hope to poll the (rather large) group of these friends and family at the baby shower today, which I&#8217;ll extend here too:</p>
<ul>
<li>What will be the gender of the baby and the delivery date?</li>
</ul>
<p>Winner may get a prize. Perhaps this might influence your choice:</p>
<ul>
<li>Official estimated due date is July 30, despite my initial calculations at July 21. Although, less than 5% of women actually deliver on their due date.</li>
<li>Everyone thinks that it&#8217;s a boy based on how I&#8217;m &#8220;carrying&#8221; = all in the front</li>
<li>Mothers on my mother&#8217;s side of the family (Cousin and aunts) have all given birth at least 2-3 weeks early</li>
<li>Personally, I used to want a boy first so that the older brother could take care of a younger sister/sibling. But now, I kind of not-so-secretly hope that the baby might be a girl (to prove everyone wrong, plus I like the name that we picked out for a possible girl more). Then again, a boy would balance out the number of girls that moms around us have been having!</li>
</ul>

I&#8217;ve been feeling very blessed, with unexpected gifts from various people and even more help around the house by Daddy-to-be!

As I tie up loose ends at work and at home, I still don&#8217;t feel adequately prepared, but a Bible verse has popped up in my readings, which seems very suitable for the upcoming days &#8211; I&#8217;ve been trying to commit the bolded text to memory, so that it will get me through labour!:</p>
<blockquote><p>But [the Lord] said to me ,&#8221;<strong>My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness.</strong>&#8221; Therefore I will boast all the more gladly of my weaknesses, so that the power of Christ may rest upon me. &#8211; 2 Corinthians 12:9-10 (ESV)</p></blockquote>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				After this week, I&#8217;ll be &#8220;full-term&#8221; meaning that if the baby decides to come anytime between next week and my due date, it&#8217;s considered fine. Actually, I&#8217;m a little nervous because both immediate and extended family history seems to indicate that all the kids have arrived between 2-3 weeks early, which doesn&#8217;t give me very much time left at all! But, I can&#8217;t ask for better timing, because my mat leave coincides with a lot of changes at work, including an office move to Cambridge, which I can now avoid.<br />
When people at work told me that by the end, I&#8217;d be looking forward to just getting the baby out, I didn&#8217;t quite get it. But now, I walk funny at times, and just don&#8217;t feel as comfortable anymore, but that still doesn&#8217;t mean that I&#8217;m looking forward to labour.<br />
There&#8217;s been a flurry of activities in the past few weeks, with many people to thank: j.w especially has been great at keeping up with many of them, including getting the baby room painted (with help from Heidi!) and the wall decor put up (gift from the Tungs) and laundry done (of the baby clothes and bedding); even the in-laws have  taken up the task of making the ginger and vinegar concoction!<br />
<img class="alignnone" alt="" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-8xqBpqM5ZaQ/UdXH8SckmYI/AAAAAAAAG74/nXHI9V5vYmI/s640/1372911089341.jpg" width="640" height="640" /><br />
And, since people have asked, here&#8217;s an obligatory picture at around Week 34/35 (which is late into the 8th month, for those who don&#8217;t keep track by weeks).<br />

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				My pregnant self continues to surprise me. In my pre-pregnancy days, I would think , &#8220;<em>If I ever get pregnant, I&#8217;d want it to be as painless as possible ; in fact, maybe we&#8217;ll just adopt!&#8221;  </em>(I have a low pain threshold) Yet, somehow, over the course of pregnancy, my thinking has evolved from wanting a scheduled/elected C-section to an epidural at a minimum to: &#8220;<em>I&#8217;m hoping for a natural birth if at all possible&#8230;.&#8221;  </em>while keeping an open mind for pain relief choices/options.<br />
And with just over a month to go (less to reach full-term), here&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve continued to discover:</p>
<ul>
<li>My wardrobe has shrunk down to 1/3 of its size, giving us a lot more closest space; maternity clothes from aunts&#8217; generation still seem many sizes too big/wide (and I don&#8217;t think it ever will work at this point), but low-rise skinny jeans/pants still fit, if left partially buttoned with the hair-tie technique or with a belly band</li>
<li>Pelvic bone pain/pressure increase is normal (though at times, walking hurts as a result)</li>
<li>Baby still has room to hiccup and move around, to the amusement of j.w, and Grace and Vivian today</li>
<li>Dad baby books are much more light-hearted and easier to read than mommy books (but with similar content). Why are ours so much more serious?</li>
<li>Belly sometimes gets in the way of putting on socks, pants, and tying my shoe, and especially when going to public washrooms where small stall doors open inwards</li>
</ul>
<p>Outstanding checklist items:</p>
<ul>
<li>Start packing a hospital bag</li>
<li>Complete laundry for baby items</li>
<li>Paint baby room, put up Blik decal</li>
<li>Finish basement</li>
<li>Tidy up and get the house ready for baby and guests</li>
<li>Then, there is the task or obligations of traditional customs like making vinegar ginger soup Long-boiled soup isn&#8217;t a forté of mine to begin with and I dread having to reboil a concoction daily</li>
</ul>
<p>&#8212;-<br />
Side note: I spent a day in Toronto with Grace this past weekend to see <em>Kim&#8217;s Convenience</em> at the Distillery District, a 90-minute, 5-cast (7? character) play that peeks into the life of a Korean family, touching upon cultural and generational stereotypes and ideas between the first-generation parents and their second-generation children, often with moments that I could identify with a comedic approach and some tear-jerking scenes. It was quite appropriate for Father&#8217;s Day weekend, as it was primarily around the dynamics between the father and his daughter (played by Grace&#8217;s friend, also named Grace) and  the son, including how they express love to each other, reminding me of the story of the prodigal son and how our Father&#8217;s love is unconditional. The performance was completely worth the $50, which is more than what I would normally spend on the theatre, but my excuse was that it would probably be one of the last pre-parent outings for awhile&#8230;Plus, the performers (Ins Choi &#8211; also screenwright, Jean Yoon &#8211; who was stopped by an older couple as she cycled by) seemed approachable and pleasant to have a casual chat with. If it stops in Vancouver next May, I&#8217;m going to recommend it to my Vancouver friends, especially the Tungs!		</p>
