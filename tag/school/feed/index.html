<p>Now that we&#8217;re into an almost-established routine with our oldest in junior kindergarten, it&#8217;s not as confusing for me, as the parent. Maybe it&#8217;s just our school, but it seems like they just <em>assume</em> that we know what to do or where to go, so this is a shortlist of what I wish I knew before she started or what I wish the school had communicated &#8211; maybe it&#8217;ll help me again in a few years&#8217; time:</p>


<h3>Kindergarten</h3>


<ul><li><a href="http://www.edu.gov.on.ca/kindergarten/whatelsedoineedtoknow.html">Kindergarten is not mandatory in Ontario</a>, and if your kid is not 6 years old by the time kids born in the same year start Grade 1, <a href="https://beta.theglobeandmail.com/news/toronto/toronto-kindergarten-late-birthdays/article34229793/?ref=http://www.theglobeandmail.com&amp;" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">you may opt to send him a year later</a>. Most people send their kids into the education system when between 3 to 4 years old for junior kindergarten and they go for a full day (~6.5 hours) without a nap time (which is fine &#8211; I recall just lying on gym mats looking up at the flourescent lights in the ceiling anyway during my half day of kindergarten).</li></ul>


<figure class="wp-block-image alignright wp-image-5884 size-medium"><img src="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/firstday-e1506485761643-300x225.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-5884" srcset="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/firstday-e1506485761643-300x225.jpg 300w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/firstday-e1506485761643-768x576.jpg 768w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/firstday-e1506485761643-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/firstday-e1506485761643-1568x1175.jpg 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><figcaption> My first day of junior kindergarten too (as a parent of a JKer)!</figcaption></figure>


<ul><li>Because kindergarten is not mandatory, you can choose to send your child part-time but of course, the educators will try to encourage you to follow everyone else.  If you plan to do modified schedule: <strong>notify the principal in advance before the start of the school year. </strong><em><strong>On orientation day, after discussing this with the teaching staff and getting their support, the office administrator asked me why I didn&#8217;t do it before September, but how was I supposed to know?</strong></em> </li></ul>


<ul><li>Your child&#8217;s backpack should be able to fit something that is 8.5&#215;11&#8243; in size &#8211; but parents don&#8217;t see this requirement until the first week of school when you get the classroom orientation package, and by then many would have already bought a backpack! </li></ul>


<ul><li>You&#8217;re supposed to provide a pair of indoor shoes for your child &#8211; <strong>pro-tip</strong>: if it&#8217;s a pair of running shoes or can be gym-ready, then you don&#8217;t need a second one for gym time </li></ul>


<ul><li>Even though you may have just met the teacher, a school-wide meet-the-teacher day happens two days after, and you&#8217;re welcome for another visit. There is no other information provided on what to expect at meet-the-teacher day; such as, is it drop-in? do you get to have 1:1 time? does the teacher share more about the daily classroom schedule?</li></ul>


<h3>Missed time</h3>


<p>I&#8217;m not sure why this isn&#8217;t communicated, but I had to ask what the policy/process was in regards to missing school:</p>


<ul><li>If your child is only attending part-time on a regular basis, you will need to complete a form stating which morning or afternoons that she will be absent</li><li>If your child will be away for more than 5 days (planned), you need to complete a form excusing him or her from school, and state the reason [ref]I wonder how many people make up reasons, and if they even read the reasons[/ref]. If the child is away for more than 15 consecutive days without prior approval and alternate arrangements, the school will unregister him from the system.</li><li>If your child is late, you need to go to the office to sign in the student to get a late slip, and you need to sign the child out if she needs to leave early.</li></ul>


<h3>Portals of Communication</h3>


<ul><li>I don&#8217;t like the word portal when it comes to web systems, but I guess that&#8217;s what they are: there is too many remember how to get there and how to get in (no SSO or cross-linking): the student library portal, the parent/school portal, the photo day portal, the french immersion / student registration portal, scholastic payments page, the immunization reporting site, the school website for announcements &#8211; in addition to announcements in the parent/school portal &#8230;I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ve forgotten others.</li><li>The school portal makes no sense to me &#8211;
</li></ul>


<figure class="wp-block-image alignright"><a href="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/calendar.png"><img src="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/calendar-300x120.png" alt="School-Day" class="wp-image-5883" srcset="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/calendar-300x120.png 300w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/calendar-768x307.png 768w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/calendar-1024x410.png 1024w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/calendar.png 1490w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><figcaption> The default calendar is empty. What might not be immediately obvious, is that you have to select from the drop-down to see your class or school calendar.</figcaption></figure>


<p>why is there even a classroom calendar section that isn&#8217;t even used? Instead, the teacher opts to upload a PDF file of each month&#8217;s calendar. And what&#8217;s the difference between Events (which shows none when you click on it) and the School Calendar (ignore the bug for the moment, that when you click School Calendar, the Events category is selected)? And why, does the School Calendar have Phys Ed days listed but it differs from her class?
Her teacher also uses the School Files area to upload a snapshot of what they are learning once every two weeks, but other teachers use other apps to share. I wish there was a more consistent system so that parents know what to expect throughout their kids&#8217; journey in one school.
</p>


<p>&#8230;I guess I should have seen this coming, since they invited pre-JKers to check out the library last school year, but they neglected to mention that they close two weeks before school ends, and that the librarian isn&#8217;t always there, so you might not be able to sign anything out even if you visit &#8211; and no one will take your pre-JKer on a tour.</p>


<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>


<p><strong>Side note:</strong> I didn&#8217;t think the pizza day/hot dog day/fudgsicle cycle would repeat itself! I remember feeling left out when everyone else&#8217;s parents decided that a once-a-month hotdog or a pizza slice with chocolate/white milk was a fine lunch for their kids (25 cents-$1.5 subsidized), but my parents continued to send their regular (sandwich) lunches. I hope my child is stronger than I was, and will be okay that I neither will buy her a pizza slice for $1.50 4 weeks in a row, nor buy her a cookie with it. Maybe as consolation, I should send her some free pizza and homemade cookies. This is also the case for Scholastic orders &#8211; all these kids got cool books but my name was rarely ever called to get new books to take home&#8230;</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				It&#8217;s the time of the year again: it&#8217;s back to school season, and with only a few days remaining of summer, I&#8217;m starting to feel a bit anxious about school &#8211; and I&#8217;m not even the one that&#8217;s starting school!</p>
<h3>Homeschooling</h3>
<p>I have been reflecting a bit about school for the past few months &#8211; in fact, this post started as a post about homeschooling back in May, as more and more families we knew were homeschooling or planning to homeschool. I briefly considered it, and even paid to check out the <a href="http://www.kwchea.ca/conference.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">KWCHEA</a>&#8216;s homeschool conference exhibit hall to look at resources and get a better sense of what is available for a homeschooling family.  While buying into curriculum and paying for supplementary classes to supplement a child&#8217;s education / learning can be costly (vs. free public school education), I found that there were plenty of free resources (and you could develop your own curriculum as a result) and quite a bit of local support (e.g. free gym time for homeschooled children, email lists) so that you could still have social interaction with other peers. I also found that there were a few memberships that were free to join if your oldest child is under 6 years old,  which gives you access to a support network and perks like (significant) discounts to places like Great Wolf Lodge. But, what a vendor said got to me &#8211; partly because my first feeling was &#8220;no, it&#8217;s not!&#8221; but then I know that there is some truth to what he said: he basically told me that home education was God&#8217;s calling for all Christian families because the responsibility lies with the parents to teach their children and because that was how it was done historically/biblically (ie. why leave it to other people to do that). I thought about the examples in the Bible, and how children learned their father&#8217;s trade as an apprentice (yes, that supports what he&#8217;s saying), but then didn&#8217;t the young men go off to the synagogue to learn scripture from the pharisees / teacher of the law? And if it&#8217;s God&#8217;s calling for every Christian family to homeschool their children, that must mean that most are ignoring His calling &#8211; is that possible and true? With homeschooling, I know I don&#8217;t have to be as worried about the impacts of early sex education, or the in-your-face celebration of gender rights and gay pride, but I don&#8217;t want to shelter my kids either.<br />
At first, I didn&#8217;t want to consider homeschooling my children because my first exposure to a homeschooler wasn&#8217;t a very positive experience, when a student who had attended a public elementary school, then moved to being homeschooled (maybe due to her being teased for being a Jehovah&#8217;s Witness?), and then in high school tried to transition back, but she didn&#8217;t last very long and was pulled out. So, I&#8217;m biased to think that the transition from home education to public might be really difficult and not successful.</p>
<h3>Public education</h3>
<p>Among the selfish reasons why I didn&#8217;t want to homeschool is that I didn&#8217;t want to deal with the social isolation, or forcing myself and the children to interact with other homeschooled families &#8211; or trying to find ways to be socially involved, be it signing up for supplementary classes ($) or leading co-op-like initiatives. Then again, while I excelled and really enjoyed the academic parts of school, I don&#8217;t think I really felt like I truly fit in socially (oh, the insecure me, but perhaps it&#8217;s reflective of what the Bible says about being in this world, but not of it, or <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-11.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">being foreigners</a>[ref]&#8221;If you were of the world, the world would love you as its own; but because you are not of the world, but I chose you out of the world, therefore the world hates you.&#8221; Matthew 5:19 ESV[/ref]). Maybe it was due to a combination of language struggles, cultural differences, and a Christian upbringing; I&#8217;m not really sure.[ref]Case in point, 6-year-old-me awkwardly learned that just because the teacher is Chinese, it doesn&#8217;t mean that a) she speaks Chinese and b) that she can read my name in Chinese, when the worksheet says &#8220;Name:&#8221; on it. Likewise, just because she is Chinese, it also doesn&#8217;t mean she knows what <span id="result_box" class="short_text" lang="zh-TW"><span class="">白花油 is and its medicinal purposes &#8211; and will tell you to take it off because it smells -_- (embarrassed of my mom moments) . Though, </span></span>I was super happy to find a Chinese student (Canadian-Chinese) who appreciated my baked BBQ pork bun lunches.[/ref]<br />
One downside of following the crowd, kids these days are entering the education system as early as 3 years old, and at full days &#8211; without naps &#8211; too! Great for paying parents as they can save on childcare expenses, but for those young ones who have meltdowns because of missed naps, personally I think it&#8217;s too much, too soon (probably because my generation started as young as 4 years old only at half days). Actually, it&#8217;s nice that kindergarten is optional for families here, but if I hold them back, I feel that they would miss out on key social interaction development and other learning milestones and will lag far behind when starting Grade 1, especially if one throws in French immersion into the mix.<br />
I pray that her social experiences be better than mine, especially as she navigates the first few years of school! And I pray as a parent, that we&#8217;ll be responsible for keeping on top of what is being taught so that we can supplement with truth and a biblical worldview when necessary.</p>
<h3>Change</h3>
<p>As we transition into a new chapter of our lives (including new morning routines and making school-friendly lunches), I&#8217;m comforted that even though I was a bit disappointed to learn that there are 6 kindergarten classes in her school and none of her friends (or the other couple of kids we know) are in the same class, she is really excited and looking forward to starting school (much more so than when I teach her in Sunday School). After going through the <a href="https://www.strongstart.ca/programs/get-ready-for-school/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Get Ready for School</a> program, she has loved programs and have done so well in them.  When people ask me if we&#8217;re ready, this blogger mom sums up my feelings quite well: <a href="http://blog.mops.org/paving-the-runway/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">&#8220;She was so ready – that made one of us.  I’m not sure if I’m finally relieved to have some time to myself [or more time with the youngest, rather] or if I’m just terribly sad&#8221;.</a>  I know little brother will miss her dearly too, and I&#8217;m sure I won&#8217;t know what to do with just him at the beginning but here&#8217;s to change, God willing!		</p>
