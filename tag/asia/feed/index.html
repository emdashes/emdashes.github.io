								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				<![CDATA[<a title="IMG_7645 by b.p., on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aimeili/2515540874/"><img alt="IMG_7645" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2367/2515540874_b79203a8d8.jpg" width="400" height="265" /></a>
What most people don&#8217;t know about me is that I only hold my chopsticks correctly when I am in Hong Kong.
After 2.5 weeks of travelling and after experiencing much turbulence on a boat and multiple times on a plane, I am glad to be home. I didn&#8217;t seem to suffer from severe jetlag, which is likely because I regulated my sleep.
The itinerary:


<ul>
	

<li>Kitchener &#8211; (Calgary) &#8211; Vancouver</li>


	

<li>Vancouver &#8211; (Seoul) &#8211; Beijing</li>


	

<li>Beijing &#8211; Xian</li>


	

<li>Xian &#8211; Shanghai</li>


	

<li>Shanghai &#8211; Hong Kong</li>


	

<li>Hong Kong &#8211; Macau &#8211; Hong Kong</li>


	

<li>Hong Kong &#8211; (Seoul) &#8211; Vancouver</li>


	

<li>Vancouver &#8211; (Calgary) &#8211; Kitchener</li>


</ul>


Remarks:


<ul>
	

<li>What did I do on my trip? It felt like all I did was eat and shop (more eating than shopping).</li>


	

<li>The key to finding toilets (as opposed to squatting holes) in China is to look for the handicapped stalls.</li>


	

<li>I understand why people in China prefer simplified Chinese over traditional now &#8211; it&#8217;s so much more easier to read and write! (though, I still prefer traditional).</li>


	

<li>I get the general sense that natives of China think that every Chinese revolves around China-thinking &#8211; one tour guide implied to my mother that her children should learn their &#8220;mother tongue&#8221; (that is, Mandarin) after learning that we were only fluent in Cantonese; I bit my tongue and refrained from saying that Cantonese was ours.</li>


	

<li>Thankfully, we left the region neighbouring Sichuan (Xi&#8217;an) and its affected areas (including Shanghai) the day before the earthquake happened.</li>


	

<li>If we were on earlier flights, we may have experienced plane trouble. Thank God that wasn&#8217;t us.</li>


	

<li>Weddings in HK seem to be drastically different than Chinese weddings in Canada (and more tiring &#8211; I certainly had different expectations). With the amount of energy it takes for a wedding, it&#8217;s a wonder why people get married more than once.</li>


	

<li>Tourists ruin the beauty of historical sites, including the Great Wall.</li>


	

<li>Our tour guide in Beijing is either 26 years old, 31, or neither. He told my sister he was 26, and me, 31.</li>


	

<li>On the way back, I prayed that customs wouldn&#8217;t ask me questions because I&#8217;m not very good at answering under pressure (see past experience ). The customs officer asked everyone else in my family questions but when it was my turn (I was 2nd), all she really said was how young I looked!</li>


</ul>

While my current responsibilities are remaining for the time being, it allows me to bring more focus to my role. I&#8217;m not sure how to go about explaining to people what it is I do to those who may not be familiar with the industry (much less in Chinese if I can&#8217;t even do it in English &#8211; I had a hard time telling people what I did while in HK).]]&gt;		</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				<![CDATA[Friday, August 17, 2001 <br />
    As we left the house at 8:54 AM PST, a white VW Beetle drove by and surprised
    us all when we saw that it was a courtesy car from a car dealer. That must
    be a sweet deal for the person who brought her (I&#8217;m assuming, as Beetles are
    more suited as a chic car) car into the shop for repairs-unless of course,
    she was driving a Beetle herself.
  

<p>9:41 AM <br />
    A riced neon roars by with spoiler/rear wing, body kit, lights, muffler and
    paint job. Very disturbing to the eyes and ears. And if that wasn&#8217;t enough,
    at 11:53 AM, we boarded a plane full of fobs (a big surprise here). One realization
    came to my brother and I though. The Hongers cannot be fobs, b/c they didn&#8217;t
    get off the plane to land in HK, so does that mean we, the CBCs, are fobs
    in HK?! </p>


  

<p>A small A340. I cannot tell the difference between that and a 767. But it
    seemed scarier that a plane that is almost the same size as the 767 (the plane
    that took me from Ontario to British Columbia), would carry me 12 hours to
    HK! Prior to takeoff, I sneaked a magazine off the executive-class (I think)
    shelf and shocked my mother into asking me if my &#8220;boyfriends&#8221; in
    Ottawa were interested in cars, because it was entitled, &#8220;Car &amp; Driver&#8221;-there
    are some interesting things in that magazine. It beats the one on street racing
    and car parts that my brother bought before we boarded. </p>


  

<p>Saturday, August 18, 2001 </p>


  

<p>17:05 HK Standard Time <br />
    Heat wasn&#8217;t too bad the first day. It kinda reminded me of extreme Ottawa
    heat at 32 C (excluding humidity). </p>


  

<p>21:00 <br />
    Dinner at some restaurant that I have never been to-probably because my grandfather
    would have never approved of this food and &#8220;low classness&#8221; if he
    was still around. I enjoyed my first quail from HK (since 98), and had yummy
    &#8220;tong choy&#8221; (or &#8220;oong choy&#8221;), even though I just had some
    before I left Ottawa. </p>


  

<p>I actually went shopping in HK. My first stop was at Bossini, where I proceeded
    to buy clothes that actually fit me! At $6 CDN, the black cubic-zuchornia
    (however you spell that word-in any case, they remind me of diamonds), strapped
    top was definitely a good bargain! In HK, the exchange rate was on the average
    about $5 HKD: $1 CDN. I can&#8217;t believe that in HK, of all places, there are
    actually people who rice their cars-whatever for?! By the way, in case you
    don&#8217;t understand some Ottawa lingo-like my brother, I will explain some terms
    here and there: &#8220;rice&#8221; is the same thing as &#8220;soup&#8221; or
    &#8220;accessorize&#8221; when it comes to cars. </p>


  

<p>23:00 <br />
    Why, you ask, am I using army or Quebec style of time?! Actually, I&#8217;m not
    sure. I think I picked it up in one of the mystery books that I useta read
    and I liked that system because it&#8217;s so unique and causes less confusion.
    I remember that in Waterloo, Carey used it many times to organize cell group
    meetings and all, and even though I had to constantly subtract the last digit
    by 2, to determine the time, it kinda stuck. </p>


  

<p>Surprising, I went to bed by 23:00. I was tired. But not really jet-lagged
    b/c I didn&#8217;t wake up &#8217;til the next morning (unlike in &#8217;93 when I woke up at
    4:00 and couldn&#8217;t go back to sleep). </p>


  

<p>Sunday, August 19, 2001 </p>


  

<p>I started having dreams again. That night, I dreamt that that I was on the
    verge of missing my third exam in the examination period. I was talking to
    Jen (Waterloo classmate at one point in time and good friend), and suddenly
    realised that it was the 17th, and that I had exams scheduled on the 15th,
    16th, 17th, 30th, and 31st of August. I was supposed to be writing a geometry
    test on that day and was freaking out b/c all of my finals were worth 40%
    (sounds like high school!) and I had already missed 2. </p>


  

<p>That morning, at around 10:30, we headed to a Whampoa Alliance Church, a
    small Chinese church that played really old contemporary music and hymns,
    much more older than OCAC&#8217;s style of worship. The funny thing is that the
    name, &#8220;Whampoa&#8221;, actually sounds more Flip or of some other ethnicity
    other than Chinese. The sermon was considerably easy to understand, considering
    I had my Palm with me with the NIV bible on it, and the speaker was talking
    about the Prayer of Jabez. All I needed to do was to read my newly acquired
    book, The Prayer of Jabez, a gift from the Billy Graham Ministry, to understand
    the whole sermon. What shocked me, when I read the book, was that the pastor
    took everything from the book, including the analogies. </p>


  

<p>Lunch at 12:50. I have never realised that a Chinese custom of reserving
    a table is to stand behind a seated party and wait for them to leave before
    you grab their seats. I&#8217;ve realised why Dom says that he&#8217;s sick of Chinese
    food-you can only have so much dim sum before you get sick of it too. Especially
    if you have dim sum for breakfast, dim sum for lunch . . . thank God that
    it wasn&#8217;t dim sum for dinner! Although, we did go to a restaurant across the
    street from our place for dinner, that DOES serve dim sum during the day.
    <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> </p>


  

<p>Upon arriving to that restaurant at 19:47, memories flooded me as I recalled
    having some tea or some sauce spilt on me by the waiter in 98-that was when
    I realised how effective Shout (shout it out!) was and I have been using it
    ever since (great way for some advertising eh? :P). I think my grandmother
    is a VIP customer there, because the service was so good and the waitresses
    knew her name (well, last name anyhow). They offered tea 4 times, because
    we were drinking sugar cane juice instead. Yum! </p>


  

<p>My sister, being a Broadway freak, decided to sing a song from Annie, in
    the middle of the evening, and for the rest of the night, I had the chorus,
    &#8220;It&#8217;s a hard-knocked life . . .&#8221; going around in my head-not the
    actual song mind you, but the one that Silq kept playing in Ottawa. </p>


  

<p>During that day, I made a couple of general observations: </p>


  

<p>My brother kept wanting to play with my Palm. <br />
    There are really odd-looking cars in HK, and cars that aren&#8217;t seen here in
    Canada, like the Mitsubishi Lancer. <br />
    Internet withdrawal is no fun at all. And even though there is a cyber café
    right next door, my parents didn&#8217;t think it was safe for me to wander down
    there. <br />
    Monday, August 20, 2001 <br />
    Another night of strange dreams including a portion where I was shooting at
    people with a gun made of Lego, and another, where I was at a banquet with
    a family (parents) I didn&#8217;t know very well with one other person I knew I
    think. </p>


  

<p>Off to Ocean Park we went. My third time there (&#8217;82, &#8217;93, &#8217;01), but this
    time, we went with our cousins and my aunt. That day, I decided to wear shorts
    (because it was very sunny and hot). It was a good and a bad thing: the good
    part was that I was able to get a slight tan line (which seems to have disappeared
    already), and the bad was that I managed to obtain 5 very itchy mosquito bites-all
    at one ride: the Raging River. Consequently, I never wore shorts outdoors
    again during my trip. The Raging River was located under trees (provides the
    bugs shade), and it had really dirty water (nice place for them to lurk),
    but the ride was fun-didn&#8217;t close my eyes this time when we dropped! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> The
    Dragon, which is a roller coaster boasting to be the biggest in HK, was once
    again fun and this time, I didn&#8217;t close my eyes for the loops as I did in
    93, either ;). The Flying Swing is much like the one at PNE/Playland-very
    calm and soothing. However, the virtual ride does not compare to the one in
    Universal Studios, Hollywood at all! This one lasted maybe a mere 5 minutes
    and it wasn&#8217;t too &#8220;extreme&#8221; (too bad). One funny incident that almost
    costed my mother her ankle, was that we were talking about bats and all of
    a sudden, a couple of black butterflies flew around us, and I screamed, &#8220;BAT!&#8221;-heheh,
    my mom freaked. </p>


  

<p>Dinner was spent at my aunt&#8217;s. Her maid cooked up some yummy meal, and surprised
    us all because when she first started her job at my aunt/uncle&#8217;s place, she
    didn&#8217;t know how to cook so she read off some cookbooks that my aunt bought
    for her (b/c she useta be a supervisor for the rest of the maids at some temperamental,
    rich famous guy&#8217;s place). I later realised how well off that area was, especially
    with so many nice cars, and a somewhat famous singer by the name of Shirley
    Kwan (admittedly, whom I have never heard) that lives next-door. </p>


  

<p>Tuesday, August 21, 2001 </p>


  

<p>More interesting dreams. One of them I attended a small church fellowship
    in HK and one of the guys made me feel welcome and asked me where I was from,
    etc. etc. </p>


  

<p>Cold water showers are so much warmer than cold water showers at night. I
    don&#8217;t like taking cold showers in general, but I didn&#8217;t know how to work the
    hot water. I later realised that you had to wait a couple of minutes before
    each tiny change of temperature would take into effect. </p>


  

<p>I accompanied my mother and my aunt and my sister in hopes that I would be
    able to buy something while my mom was shopping for shoes. Unfortunately,
    she literally stuck to the plan and for many hours straight, all we did was
    look at shoes. Thankfully, I managed to purchase something, not exactly what
    I was looking for (clothes), but oh well, a pair of sandals for $20 CDN is
    still pretty good :). Thankfully, we got a break from shopping in the evening,
    when we went bowling at the Hong Kong Cricket Club that my aunt&#8217;s family belongs
    to in Happy Valley. Yes, my aunt&#8217;s garage alone in Happy Valley is home to
    some nice cars: Audi TT, Porsche Boxter, a Ferrari of some sort. Others that
    zoom by include Z3s, s2000s, and 911s, MR2 (not Spyder though). Skyline seen
    in Tsim Sha Tsui. </p>


  

<p>Wednesday, August 22, 2001 </p>


  

<p>I think I&#8217;m a l&#8217;il &#8220;Ottawa&#8221;-sick because my dreams that evening,
    had Dom, Josh, and Marc in them. In one of my dreams, I figured that if &#8220;Melancholy&#8221;
    didn&#8217;t have such a depressing association with it, it would be a nice name
    b/c it&#8217;s 4 syllables in length and one could shorten it to &#8220;Mel&#8221;.
  </p>


  

<p>Today, we went bowling yet again. I seem to only bowl well with a 9 lb bowling
    ball. The unfortunate thing was that there was only 1 of those available to
    be shared w 4 lanes. Everything else ends up in the gutter. Sigh :\. I don&#8217;t
    think I&#8217;ve ever bowled this many times in a week before. </p>


  

<p>We also went to the CityPlaza Shopping Centre and while my mom shopped for
    shoes, my sis and I decided to explore the rest of the place and discovered
    that the Disney Store had a closing sale and everything was ½ price
    off the lowest ticketed price!! We were lucky (I don&#8217;t believe in luck) because
    2 days after when we went again, it was already closed. I bought a couple
    of items, including a Mulan VHS video (in Cantonese) for $8 CDN. However,
    in my AV ignorance, I didn&#8217;t realise that the videos in HK could not play
    in Canadian VCRs unless one has a dual VCR (which we don&#8217;t). I also bought
    two ¾-sleeve shirts for $9 CDN each at U2. </p>


  

<p>Thursday, August 23, 2001 </p>


  

<p>Our family and my grandmother left HK early to take the train to Shenzhen
    (45 min to 1 hr train ride). I think I understand why we like to stereotype
    &#8220;big green&#8221; people-most have a less sophisticated lifestyle than
    the average HK resident. If you ask me to go to Shenzhen again, I think I&#8217;d
    have to think twice. </p>


  

<p>We stopped at a restaurant for some lunch. There, I discovered that using
    tea to wash dishes in TO or Ottawa is nothing compared to what they do in
    China; they actually give you a bowl of tea to rinse your dishes in before
    they take the dirty tea bowl away. And I thought that was bad. The dim sum
    is the most disgusting restaurant food I&#8217;ve had in a very long time! I refused
    to eat the pork spareribs because my mom told me that they went bad, and my
    shark-fin dumpling soup tasted like &#8220;soap water&#8221; (gan-sui). Most
    people in Shenzhen speak Mandarin (and only understand Mandarin) now, even
    though this was originally a place of Canton descent. Getting around this
    area would be difficult if one did not know any Chinese at all. The maid (who
    is 23 years old), at the place where I was staying, was surprised to learn
    that I did not speak or know any Mandarin (well, &#8220;any&#8221; is almost
    right considering China Mandarin is not what I know). I don&#8217;t think she realises
    that in Canada, not every &#8220;jook sing&#8221; is bilingual in Cantonese
    and Mandarin. And if a &#8220;jook sing&#8221; is fluent in one of these dialects,
    that is already pretty impressive in itself. </p>


  

<p>Shopping. Negotiating is not something I&#8217;m professionally good at-so I leave
    all the negotiating with my mom. Somehow, we ended up negotiating a cell-phone
    cover from 10 RMB (Ren Men Bi?-China currency is 10% less than HK) to about
    6 RMB (that&#8217;s around $1 CDN). In retrospect, I believe that we could&#8217;ve done
    better. Ah well. It&#8217;s only $1. </p>


  

<p>That night, we went to some cultural centre to view a costume poetic performance.
    Many tourists from HK were there. Thankfully, it took place indoors (w mild
    AC) so we didn&#8217;t die in the heat. The mini bus system is crazy there! They
    squished at least 50 people in a 16 or-so-seats mini bus. I almost suffocated
    in there. </p>


  

<p>I can probably say that a missions trip to China was very appealing to me
    until I went on this 1-day trip. I don&#8217;t think I can stand having to live
    without toilets for a month or so. Even though at some places, the holes in
    the floor are flushable and are surrounded with ceramic, I&#8217;m just thankful
    that I was paranoid enough to bring a roll of toilet paper w me from Vancouver
    ;P. Well, there&#8217;s always Kleenex packs, but I don&#8217;t like using them. The technique
    of peeing in a hole. Well, anyhow, I envy the guys when it comes to this.
  </p>


  

<p>Friday, August 24, 2001 </p>


  

<p>After spending a very hot night (the AC shut off in the middle of the night)
    trying to sleep on a sofa bed (hard plywood board at the top and soft at bottom),
    my mom, sis and I decided to leave early b/c we couldn&#8217;t stand the heat (yeah,
    I know we&#8217;re wimps/high maintenance). There was a heatstroke warning that
    day anyhow. I don&#8217;t think we would&#8217;ve survived if we were to go the &#8220;Small
    World&#8221; park of the miniature wonders/landmarks of the world. </p>


  

<p>Spent the evening at my aunts after s&#8217;more shopping. I bought 2 pairs of
    semi-casual sandals for $10 CDN each (nice but they have heels that are waay
    too high for me-well, at least I can now be at least 2.5 inches taller! :)).
    Boy, is HK so much cooler in comparison to Shenzhen! </p>


  

<p>Saturday, August 25, 2001 </p>


  

<p>This time, my dreams had Peon, Marc, Jon, Dom, and Josh in it. Peon asked
    me a strange question but I can&#8217;t remember what it was exactly or why she
    asked it. </p>


  

<p>In the evening, I met up with Jen Lam at Causeway Bay after a morning of
    shopping at Wan Chai (bought a shoulder bag for a mere $4 CDN) and an afternoon
    of bowling. It was our first time in HK without people taking us around, so
    it was an adventure. I took Jen shoe shopping (because I was there earlier
    in the week when my mom was looking for shoes-the reason why she looks for
    shoes like mad is because she&#8217;s only a size 34 (4-5) and not many stores carry
    that size) and Jen took me to the Hello Kitty Café to eat dinner. It&#8217;s
    a very &#8220;cute&#8221; café. Everything is Hello Kitty-from the tables/chairs
    to the food itself-the &#8220;soy&#8221; meat in the noodles were shaped in
    the face of Hello Kitty. </p>


  

<p>I think if I didn&#8217;t meet up with Jen that day, I wouldn&#8217;t have been able
    to find such good deals in HK b/c we ended up stopping at U2 and we bought
    the same pair of pants ($8 CDN though the price tag said $12CDN/$60 HKD)-except
    she commented that I gained weight b/c she fits a M and I had to take an XL
    b/c they had no more L left and usually, we&#8217;re about the same size in weight
    and height :P. I also grabbed one ¾-sleeve long-sleeves for $6 CDN,
    and 2 v-necked T&#8217;s (style like my white one but w/o buttons) for $2.40 CDN
    each. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> I think she bought a T too, cept she chose one size smaller than
    what I had (because I don&#8217;t like it when it shrinks in the dryer). </p>


  

<p>Sunday, August 26, 2001 </p>


  

<p>After church that morning, we decided to see the Whampoa mall, which has
    a very unique architectural design-a cruise ship structure-very interesting,
    especially when you can see it from the harbour. On the StarCruise Leo, we
    were able to see this mall smack in the middle of residential buildings, looking
    as if it was a scene from Speed II. </p>


  

<p>The StarCruise Leo-first time on a cruise. First impression of lobby area:
    woah, this is like a hotel (somehow it reminded me of West Ed Mall)! Each
    ship of the company is named after an astrological star/constellation, but
    my brother made an interesting comment, &#8220;What about StarCruise Cancer?!&#8221;
    as he noticed that his &#8220;sign&#8221; was missing from the fleet). During
    that entire day, I felt like I was coming down with something because I felt
    like throwing up because my stomach was quite wheezy-and during the previous
    night, while my sister was warm in her sleep, I was freezing cold. It didn&#8217;t
    help that I still feel the ship move, even in mild weather. </p>


  

<p>During this trip, I developed an interesting theory on why I don&#8217;t like airplanes
    rides. I think it&#8217;s because it&#8217;s constantly rocking/moving, and one&#8217;s enclosed
    in such a tight space. Not to mention that whenever I fall asleep, I&#8217;m half
    self-conscious b/c of where my head goes-if it leans over to the next person,
    if it falls forward, etc. </p>


  

<p>There&#8217;s not too much to do on a cruise ship. Internet access is $8 CDN for
    ½ hr and everything else (such as arcades) require money as well. The
    only thing I did that day was &#8220;swim&#8221; (or splashed around -that&#8217;s
    more like it), saw a dance/acrobatics stage show (with Vegas showgirls but
    they, thankfully, had clothes on in this session) where in one act, a woman
    used a bow and arrow to shoot an apple off of her own head! Very dangerous
    indeed. </p>


  

<p>Monday, August 27, 2001 </p>


  

<p>Around noon, we arrived at Sayan Hainan Island, China. Our family joined
    a bus tour to a big Buddhist temple. We made a bathroom stop along the way-you
    know, the places where the tour guides and the company has an agreement that
    if we buy into what they are trying to sell us (this time it&#8217;s &#8220;lian-zhi&#8221;
    leaves), the tour guides get a percentage of commission. The ladies seem to
    be the ones that target you-they try to push you to buy their products like
    crazy. Anyhow, I can&#8217;t believe I went to the bathroom here; I had to endure
    another &#8220;holy&#8221; one. See, if I knew that the temple actually had
    toilets, I probably would&#8217;ve used those instead. Sigh. </p>


  

<p>Sheesh, the roads there are worse than those in Montréal-tons of potholes
    that shoot you to the ceiling. I was really tired so I managed to catch a
    wink of sleep because I was extremely tired that day. There was not much to
    see at the temple. However, I did learn that they were starting to build an
    idol/statue that would reach higher than the Statue of Liberty in New York.
    That&#8217;s crazy. Next, they&#8217;ll probably repeat the story of the Tower of Babel
    as told in Genesis. The vegetarian meal was done quite well though at the
    local temple restaurant. Much of the texture of the imitation meat (soy) was
    very close and it tasted quite like the flavour of the meat dish. </p>


  

<p>On our way back, the tour bus let us stop to try some &#8220;tea&#8221;-one
    kind of tea they let the group try was made from &#8220;foo-gua&#8221; (bitter
    melon). It tasted very interesting. There were other bitter teas that they
    brewed, but after we tried them all, the ladies once again tried to sell them
    to us-I can&#8217;t believe that a can of tea leaves would cost at least $80 CDN!
  </p>


  

<p>By the time we boarded on the ship again, it was around 19:02. I was somewhat
    hungry again, and during dinner, my sister and I ate a 3 course Western meal,
    while my parents and my brother chose the Chinese set menu. According to my
    sister, I apparently &#8220;eat a lot&#8221;-she said that I used to eat less
    than she did. Well, if that is the case, I&#8217;m grateful for a high metabolism
    rate then, because I haven&#8217;t gained much (if any) for many years now :). </p>


  

<p>After an evening show at the theatre (which included a synchronised light
    and music show, and an elderly lady in the audience energetically following
    the cast dancing to the YMCA onstage-which was mighty impressive), my sis
    and I decided to check out the small casino that was on the ship with my mom
    in tow. As we arrived at the door, the security guards asked us &#8220;young
    ladies&#8221; to step aside (you see, the age of majority is 18 there so my
    sis wanted to take the opportunity to see something like this before she heads
    back to Canada and waits another year). As my mother waited for a cross-reference
    check (asked us for our access cards and called security office) on her kids,
    my sister in a stage-whisper loudly proclaims to me, &#8220;But, you&#8217;re 21!&#8221;
    &#8216;Twas quite amusing because I don&#8217;t think the security guard actually believed
    her because he turned to take a glance at me, considering I think he probably
    thought my sister was older than I was-and until the reference confirmed that
    we were of legal age. All he said was, &#8220;Thank you,&#8221; as we walked
    off smirking. </p>


  

<p>Tuesday, August 28, 2001 </p>


  

<p>This time, my dreams contained Melody C., and Ben C. in them (they are not
    related. Melody is from my high school and Ben is from UW). </p>


  

<p>At 7:30, the ship docks in Danang, Vietnam and we disembark for another tour.
    This time, we joined a bus/walking tour to the local museums and embroidery
    shops/galleries. </p>


  

<p>Impressions of Central Vietnam (first time in Vietnam): </p>


  

<p>Many signs of a developing (poor) country/city. <br />
    Too many motorbikes/cycles/scooters zooming on the roads. <br />
    Driving a bus or any type of vehicle is like playing the arcade game, &#8220;Crazy
    Taxi&#8221;. Sitting in the front seat of the bus is very scary. All you see
    is the bus getting so close to these bikes and most of the riders aren&#8217;t even
    wearing proper helmets (and to think that in China, we saw the remains of
    a bike accident w the helmet on the ground and the body gone). <br />
    There are too many people on the streets trying to sell goods to the tourists,
    especially to the foreigners (ie. Non-Asian) because they don&#8217;t know how to
    bargain with their prices/products. They know that it&#8217;s illegal to sell on
    private property, so they loiter around the building until we step onto the
    street, and then they start hounding us again, trying to make us pity them.
    Actually, I was lucky, I didn&#8217;t get bugged even though the rest of my family
    did (including my sister). I have a couple of theories on why: A) I followed
    behind the Australians (so to lose the focus) or B) I don&#8217;t look like I have
    any money on me b/c I still look young. These peddlers are willing to follow
    us around for blocks! <br />
    Food in this part of Vietnam definitely does not compare to pho in Canada.
    Maybe we were not served the best, but the pho and spring rolls are really
    gross compared to the Canadian Vietnamese food. However, dragon fruit has
    a very interesting taste to it. <br />
    At this point, I concluded that I felt fat (for once). All we ever did on
    the cruise was eat, eat, and eat. No time to digest. I remember that towards
    the end, I kept feeling hungry 1 hour after I ate a meal, even though I knew
    that I just ate. Thankfully, I don&#8217;t think I gained any, if much. If I did,
    it&#8217;s only a maximum of 1 lb. (but unfortunately, it would be in the wrong
    areas). </p>


  

<p>Back at the ship, we watched Cast Away, starring Tom Hanks and featuring
    Helen Hunt (I wonder if Dom has this one). I didn&#8217;t like it b/c I almost fell
    asleep-the storyline went a l&#8217;il too slow for my liking, and we had to endure
    1 hour of monologue w/o any musical background. I don&#8217;t understand why they
    chose to feature this film though, due to the fact that we were, afterall,
    on a cruise and the weather was becoming stormy. Well, at least they didn&#8217;t
    show Titanic (although the drills they had at the beginning had life jackets
    much like those on the Titanic). </p>


  

<p>Stormy weather. Not very pleasant on a cruise. I decided to be adventurous
    so I went outside alone, but it wasn&#8217;t a very good move because I almost was
    stuck out there. The winds were so high (not to mention that it was starting
    to rain) that the main doors were steeled shut and the smaller doors were
    soooo hard to pull back open b/c of the air/wind pressure or something. I
    had to pull with all my might. I think it was also around then that I decided
    to go down to the Captain&#8217;s bridge again (pretty much an area where you can
    see the &#8220;cockpit&#8221; if you were in a plane) to see what it was like
    up front. Guess what? They turned off one of their radars, and they were using
    binoculars to see! I was like, uh-oh, that doesn&#8217;t seem right. There must
    be a lot of fog or something-glad no icebergs got in the way <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f61b.png" alt="😛" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> </p>


  

<p>During the evening, I beat my brother at the arcades (racing a Celica vs.
    NS-X or something and out-cycled my brother on the physical virtual bike race).
    I slept well that night, but most of my family members didn&#8217;t because the
    ship was rocking too heavily. </p>


  

<p>Wednesday, August 29, 2001 </p>


  

<p>Surprisingly, I didn&#8217;t experience sea sickness, but my sister got mildy sick
    and we saw the remnants of someone&#8217;s breakfast on the carpet. </p>


  

<p>This time, we spent another $6 CDN on arcades (that&#8217;s $3 each) and my brother
    beat my choice of car (MR2) and beat me on the bike by 1 second or so. Ah
    well. You win some, you lose some. </p>


  

<p>We docked and disembarked around 16:00. Does it ever feel good to be on land
    again :). Oddly (psychological effects I suppose), on occasions, I still felt
    the floor moving as if I was still at sea. After my first time on a cruise,
    I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll be too overly excited to go on another cruise again. Firstly,
    there&#8217;s not much to do on a ship that cannot be done elsewhere on land (as
    everything isn&#8217;t free), you don&#8217;t get to visit too many exciting places, and
    all you do is eat. I think that because it&#8217;s a Chinese tour group, that it&#8217;s
    also very noisy and rude (especially when they&#8217;re all fighting for buffet
    food). </p>


  

<p>Eew. I don&#8217;t think I will ever dare to drink wine that contains dead, preserved
    baby mice. That&#8217;s what my grandmother has in one of her shelves. Gives me
    the creeps even though I don&#8217;t mind dissecting these rodents. </p>


  

<p>Thursday, August 30, 2001 </p>


  

<p>During the previous evening, it started to really pour in HK. Even the ceilings
    in our apartment started to leak (and annoyed me to death as I was trying
    to sleep and all I could hear was plink-plink into the buckets). </p>


  

<p>I actually spotted the first VW beetle on the roads of HK today. It seems
    like a rare sight for some reason. We spent lunch at this expensive dim sum
    place with my mother&#8217;s church friend from her high school years in HK. He
    happens to be a taxi driver, and the last time we were w him (&#8217;87), my sister
    threw up in his car on the way down/up the Peak b/c she got carsick. </p>


  

<p>36 guests came out to my grandmother&#8217;s 80th birthday celebration. The bill
    came to a close $1720 CDN (works out to be $47 CDN + $4 CDN &#8220;lai see&#8221;/
    &#8220;hong bao&#8221;/ red pocket per guest). The cake (from Maxim&#8217;s) itself
    costed $1000 HKD ($200 CDN). What a rip-off, considering there was not much
    fruit-filling in the cake and the texture wasn&#8217;t all that good. I realised
    that wedding banquets must cost a fortune then considering that there is often
    a lot of guests, decorations, hired hands, and food and alcohol consumed.
  </p>


  

<p>That night, my dad killed a cockroach the length of my middle finger (at
    least and much fatter than that as well). Thankfully, that&#8217;s the first one
    I actually saw in the house. </p>


  

<p>Friday, August 31, 2001 </p>


  

<p>Yaay! We were finally returning to Vancouver today (as you can tell, I don&#8217;t
    like HK too much)! During the night, I ended up rolling off the couch and
    was about to hit the floor if my suitcase wasn&#8217;t in the way to block my fall.
    I think I rolled over in my sleep a bit too far b/c I was dreaming that I
    was twirling or something. </p>


  

<p>The plane ride back home was very turbulent. At one point, my stomach was
    doing flip-flops (because I felt like we kept falling), and so I started becoming
    paranoid when I saw the flight attendants actually strapped into theirs seats
    as well; I thought that we were going to die. In my paranoia, I decided to
    pray and ended up thinking of the results if I was to die. Somehow, I asked
    God to give me the opportunity to give me a chance to witness to my friend
    from high school even more. So, I guess I should taken whatever opportunity
    comes to me since we arrived in Vancouver 1 hour early :). </p>


  

<p>That&#8217;s my trip and this has been one long read (incomprehensive at times
    I&#8217;m sure). <br />
    Thanks for staying this far. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> </p>


  

<p>Until next time, <br />
    This is L&#8217;il Miss Bo-Peep signing off.

<p>Note to my friends who have been praying for me during my
    trip in Hong Kong: THANKS <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> </p>


  

<p>Day One: Monday, August 10, 1998 (Pacific Standard Time); Tuesday, August
    11, 1998 (Hong Kong Time Zone)<br />
    8:45 am: Becky Chan telephones my sister to say good-bye to her before she
    leaves for work. That is my wake-up call. 5 minutes later, my sister comes
    into my room to tell me to wake up and get ready to leave as my father had
    relayed the message to Sheila in the middle of Becky&#8217;s call. That&#8217;s what BC
    Tel&#8217;s call waiting is for I guess. </p>


  

<p>I don&#8217;t remember when we arrived at the airport but we got there safely.
    Pastor Joshua accompanied us as he was going to take our van back to our house
    for us. After we had checked-in with Air Canada, we had time for some lunch
    as we knew the plane food wasn&#8217;t going to be that pleasant. My family had
    Burger King and some Fortune Wok (or some kind of Wok food) . . .I on the
    other hand couldn&#8217;t eat anything but an apple because ever since Saturday,
    I had encountered a stomach virus (accompanied by a fever) and whenever I
    ate, the food didn&#8217;t stay in my digestive tract for very long (not that you
    wanted to know). I shall spare you the details, but let&#8217;s just say that I&#8217;m
    thankful that I didn&#8217;t vomit because I hate vomiting. </p>


  

<p>The A343 plane lifted-off approximately at 1:00 p.m. I barely got a chance
    to sleep on the plane. I had prayed beforehand that my stomach would last
    until I got off the plane and God answered another prayer! When I was completely
    healed was another thing, another day. Perhaps that was why my appetite wasn&#8217;t
    that big (it was God&#8217;s doing)&#8211;I only had 8 slices (or pieces) of Premium
    Plus crackers and hot water as I couldn&#8217;t eat any of the plane food (thank
    goodness, though the sushi sure looked good). I didn&#8217;t even have enough appetite
    to eat the apple that we bought at the airport last minute that totaled to
    (all currency is in Canadian) $1.00. </p>


  

<p>13 hours and 22 minutes. What a long plane ride, but to pass much of the
    time, they showed some TV sitcoms: Seinfield, Spin City, some documentary
    on American lobsters, CBC News, some music videos, and 4 movies (Aerovision
    Movie Presentations): The Lucky Guy (some Chinese movie), Sliding Doors, Wag
    The Dog (I thought that Wag the Dog was about a dog, not politics!), and The
    Real Howard Spitz. They weren&#8217;t supposed to show The Real Howard Spitz but
    I guess they had too much time on their hands. They had music to listen to
    as well, and my sister found a Christian Contemporary and Gospel music station
    with songs from Avalon, DC Talk, Amy Grant, Michael W. Smith, Jars of Clay,
    and other artists I haven&#8217;t heard of&#8211;they were the gospel songs. </p>


  

<p>The Hong Kong International airport was a big place! They had electronic/computerized
    trains that ran from one part of the airport to the other (probably because
    it would&#8217;ve taken too long to walk from one end to the other. However there
    were many things that were still in the process of repair/construction (e.g.
    a moving sidewalk). I also wanted to find the places where they had shiny
    marbled floor tiles that when one looked down, (s)he could see the reflection
    of people walking. If someone was wearing a skirt, one could&#8217;ve seen beneath
    it. I didn&#8217;t come across one then, but on the way back I inspected it and
    I could see my reflection quite clearly. Thank goodness that I wasn&#8217;t wearing
    a skirt, just jeans. </p>


  

<p>It took us 1.5 hours to get home in traffic. We could&#8217;ve taken a taxi that
    would&#8217;ve come to $60-$80 or an electric train and then transferred to the
    MTR (subway transit) but that was too inconvenient. The double decker bus
    fare for the family was $30. </p>


  

<p>After we arrived, our grandfather (you see only he was there because my aunt
    and her kids went to China and my grandmother and my uncles were in Guam)
    took us out to dinner but all I had was plain rice because I still couldn&#8217;t
    eat properly (yum). By the time we got home, it was nearly 10 p.m. but even
    though it&#8217;s not that late, we were all really tired so we went to bed really
    soon. </p>


  

<p>
    Day Two: Wednesday, August 12, 1998 (Hong Kong Time Zone)<br />
    6:59 am: Pitter-patter . . .drip, drip, drip . . .the pouring rain woke me
    up so I got up to adjust the air-conditioner. My brother also woke up so we
    turned on the television to see if there were any Chinese cartoons on. However,
    the only program that kept coming on was the morning news, which kept rerunning
    even up to 8:30 am when we went to wash-up and have breakfast. </p>


  

<p>Because everyone woke up so early, we decided to go out and walk around to
    see if there were any shops nearby that were open. You wouldn&#8217;t believe it
    if I told you that none of the shops open until 10:30 am at the earliest (but
    they close at 9:30 p.m. or later every night)! We had dim sum at 3 p.m. because
    we had to clean our apartment (it was just newly renovated). We then proceeded
    into probably one of the largest HMVs in Hong Kong (and perhaps the world).
    It had four stories with different types of music located on each floor. At
    the time, there was a &#8220;crazy sale&#8221; so we decided to look to see
    if there were any CDs that were by contemporary Christian artists. Since there
    was no alphabetical order of the artists names in the sale racks, we had to
    spend quite a bit of time flipping through each CD before coming across the
    Newsboys single, &#8216;Take Me To Your Leader&#8217; and Steven Curtis Chapman&#8217;s, &#8216;Signs
    of Life&#8217; (I think my brother found both of them). My sister purchased the
    Newsboys CD that had 5 songs on it including the &#8216;Shine&#8217; remix ($2) and I
    purchased the Steven Curtis Champman one ($10). </p>


  

<p>In the afternoon, we got a chance to watch a Chinese cartoon &#8216;Ding Dong&#8217;
    or otherwise known as &#8216;Doramoen&#8217; (spelling?). . . I think it was until our
    aunt invited us to dinner in Hong Kong Island (we live in Tsim Sha Tsui, Kowloon).
    We took the Star Ferry across the ocean/sea (?) and had dinner (which I decided
    to take a chance and eat real food&#8211;big mistake). Their apartment is considered
    to be one of the &#8220;well-off&#8221; luxurious ones. It had 4 bedrooms, 2
    bathrooms including full bathtubs and showers with gas-heated hot water tanks,
    1 big storage area/closet, a huge dining table, leather couches, cabled TV
    (my grandparents don&#8217;t own these you see), and a DVD/karoake machine (and
    I forgot also a hired maid). They even are members of certain clubs (you know,
    places where you may use the facilities for approximately $1000 a year). That
    night, the three of us (kids) got a chance to stay overnight and I finally
    decided to suffer and take this disgusting bitter tasting Chinese medicine
    (which contains 50% alcohol, metholaumem, distilled water, cloves, nutmeg,
    and other ingredients) in hopes of ridding that awful reaction I got after
    eating (well, I think it must&#8217;ve worked because I was pretty much okay the
    following day). </p>


  

<p>
    Day Three: Thursday, August 13, 1998 (Hong Kong Time Zone)<br />
    Um, yeah so I was going on and on about what happened but my screen froze
    and I had to start all over again (from Day 3 to Day 4) and at the same time
    I am watching The Devil&#8217;s Advocate so I am really distracted. Anyway, I seemed
    to have misplaced my notes until the end of summer and it was not until now
    (December 19, 1998) that I am finishing my journal. So that morning, I woke
    up at 10 am to the noise of the kids talking. I spent most of my time being
    bored that day because my cousins had a private tutor over. However, we got
    a chance to go to the stationary store nearby and I got a chance to buy some
    signo milky pens for a good price. That night, we went back across the harbour
    (via the Star Ferry) and went to a restaurant to eat dinner with my mother&#8217;s
    relatives. My, were the dishes ever small!!!!! Never seen such like them!
  </p>

    Day Four: Friday, August 14, 1998 (Hong Kong Time Zone)<br />
    After breakfast that morning, our family decided to go the science centre
    except it was closed. You see, we have a family membership at Science World
    and so there is free admission to other science centres around the world.
    Because the science centre was still closed, we walked around for awhile.
    My sister, being Sheila, who loves to shop (unlike myself), bought many clothes
    while I just bought a purse (a purse? I thought it was stickers!) Anyway,
    we went to the most non-Chinese place in the world for lunch: McDonald&#8217;s.
    However, the iced lemon tea in the McDonald&#8217;s are only found in Hong Kong
    (well not here anyway). A McCrunch was the latest trend (some pork burger)
    so that is what I had. We proceeded to go to Tom Lee and we ended up buying
    the latest hits music for the piano, flute, trumpet except the music were
    not all in the same key which I didn&#8217;t know then ~ oh well. We finally went
    back to the science centre and quickly looked around-4 floors and I&#8217;m sure
    some of you know that already since I was there in 1993-and went home for
    the night. </p>


  

<p>
    Day Five: Saturday, August 15, 1998 (Hong Kong Time Zone)<br />
    The adults had a meeting so the kids were stuck downstairs in a room drawing
    and reading and stuff. Wasn&#8217;t my idea of fun but for dim sum, we were able
    to pick what kind of food we wanted =) and so it was good for once! More shopping
    afterwards. Again. The dinner that night was great. Well, it was hilarious.
    We got stuck with some other kids that were staying with my father&#8217;s relatives
    at our own table. They were so annoying at first and they wouldn&#8217;t talk to
    us. Anyway, after one kid threw a napkin and hit a man in the face (sitting
    next to our table), he cried. I didn&#8217;t feel sorry for him even though the
    man got so angry. I thought he deserved it. Apparently, my cousin did and
    she went and tried to cheer him up. Soon enough, he was laughing tears if
    you know what I mean. And once again, they didn&#8217;t believe I was 18. Seriously,
    who does?! One of the girls on my floor when they saw me thought that I was
    16-yeah a genius. I wish. After our very interesting evening, we went home
    and since it was my third uncle&#8217;s birthday, we served him cake. That night
    I think I went to bed early because the next day we had Sunday service at
    8:30 am at the Tsim Sha Tsui Baptist Church which I went to 5 years ago too.
  </p>


  

<p>
    Day Six: Sunday, August 16, 1998 (Hong Kong Time Zone)<br />
    English service with organ worship and hymns except for Majesty is very different.
    The chairperson doing the announcements was Caucasian but yet it was so impressive
    cuz he was translating from a Chinese printed bulletin! Mom, Sheila and I
    met up with my fourth aunt (the same one who has such a luxurious house) and
    went shopping some more. I finally had a chance to drink some bubble tea ~
    mmmmmmm . . .it&#8217;s so good! Is it only this good in Hong Kong?! Anyway, did
    I ever mention that Hong Kong has this really crazed fad with Hello Kitty?
    It was really annoying. And I tried some &#8220;stinky&#8221; tofu-it&#8217;s not
    as great as what everyone says it is. It&#8217;s kinda sour tasting. Oh, we also
    went to buy some shoes for me. The salespeople all thought that I was not
    more than 14. One of them didn&#8217;t believe that even though my mother told him.
    Sheesh. So I ended up buying (or my mother ended up buying for me) shoes,
    jacket, and I bought a $5 nice T, some more pens. How come I don&#8217;t remember
    eating at a Thai cuisine for dinner? Oh well, if my notes say so then I guess
    that is what we did. And we took the ever so expensive but-not-as-expensive-as-Vancouver-I-don&#8217;t-think
    taxi home. </p>


  

<p>
    Day Seven: Monday, August 17, 1998 (Hong Kong Time Zone)<br />
    This Monday was a very special day for Hong Kong because it was supposedly
    the date that China chased Japan outta their country or something. Anyway,
    we woke up at 7:30 am because the family was going to meet my mother&#8217;s friend
    for an early dim sum. Apparently, that friend and his wife were going to see
    a movie afterwards, but I forgot which one it was. So we left them alone and
    our aunt came and took us shopping to help my mother buy a dress for the banquet.
  </p>


  

<p>As the time neared 3:00 p.m. I think (you see both my watches were out-of-order
    so I really have no sense of time), we decided to go to my aunt&#8217;s club for
    lunch. I thought since it was a club, the food would be pretty good so I decided
    to try a shepherd&#8217;s pie. Bad mistake! The pie was quite unappealing because
    it had so much spaghetti-kind meat in it but the orange juice sure tasted
    yummy! </p>


  

<p>In the late afternoon, we went home and the 3 girls (Sheila, Iris, and I)
    spent the rest of the afternoon picking out jewelry from my grandmother as
    she was very generous in giving away the jewelry she still had from the jewelry
    store they own previously. Dinner rolled by again but this time, we had to
    take the MTR (subway) to Mong Kok (but they pronounce it Wong Kok so I still
    haveta figure that one out). </p>


  

<p>That evening, the cousins all decided to practice the El Shaddai piece without
    the cassette player for awhile and one of the younger cousins also decided
    to incorporate a VBS song as well. However, since the cassette player wasn&#8217;t
    bought yet, he was going to teach it to us the following day. </p>


  

<p>At last!!! The hot water tank was finally working (the construction people
    were working at finishing the rest of the house during the day) so I was able
    to take a nice warm shower instead of in freezing (not quite but close to)
    water! =) And the ZZZZ!s came upon me. </p>


  

<p>
    Day Eight: Tuesday, August 18, 1998 (Hong Kong Time Zone)<br />
    Woke up. (duh). Sat around doing nothing after breakfast. Went to lunch with
    my &#8220;dai&#8221; aunt&#8217;s mother and father. Our family then went to a Chinese
    Christian bookstore. I was going to buy some Chinese memory verse cards that
    were relatively easy to read/understand but they were sold out and thus, I
    didn&#8217;t make a purchase at all. We went to a China store (i.e. a store with
    stuff from China not made out of China) and I think my mother bought a pair
    of shoes there. Formal family pictures were taken at a studio far away. I
    am not patient at those things, they are too picky and they take waay too
    many pictures. By the time we got there, I was all sticky even though I just
    took a shower before leaving the house. Dinner was at 9 p.m. (grrr so hungry
    by then). Dry thunderstorm afterwards . . .and that was the interesting evening.
  </p>


  

<p>
    Day Nine: Wednesday, August 19, 1998 (Hong Kong Time Zone)<br />
    Yawn!!!!!!! We woke up early &#8212; but don&#8217;t ask me why we did that because I
    had forgotten that the science museum didn&#8217;t open until 1:00 p.m. and the
    art museum&#8211;who knows when that opened! Well, it&#8217;s kinda neat though because
    on Wednesdays, both museums are free! It was our grandparents&#8217; 60th wedding
    anniversary so after breakfast, we practiced our performance songs: Oh God
    Loves You And Me and El Shaddai. Anyway that is to explain later. The art
    museum was very interesting and uninteresting at the same time. I don&#8217;t understand
    why they charge people money though, it&#8217;s not worth it and I wouldn&#8217;t go if
    I had to pay. The funny thing is at the gift shop they sell CDs that are supposed
    to be therapeutical such as a constipation-reliever. That is true! I am not
    lying! </p>


  

<p>Went to the restaurant early to practice our songs. My sister sang like never
    before and of course I was nothing in comparison (we both had solos for El
    Shaddai). During the banquet, the kids had our own table and my grandfather
    gave such a long speech in Chinese that I think everyone eventually got bored.
    Because it was the last night before my cousins were to leave, they came over
    and had a sleepover. </p>


  

<p>
    Day Ten: Wednesday, August 20, 1998 (Hong Kong Time Zone)<br />
    At 9 am we had to get up and &#8220;send&#8221; our cousins and their parents
    off. We shopped and we went to a music studio cuz my father&#8217;s uncle or something,
    wanted to give a violin to my brother because we were looking for one and
    he happened to overhear and so he offered one as a gift. Had dim sum with
    them and got to hear more interesting stories of his childhood. He is a very
    good storyteller. Shopped some more. Wow, so what else is new? </p>


  

<p>That is all I have down on paper, I think we left the day after. The End.
    Phew. <br />
    PS. Watched Titanic on the way back (on the plane) they had sensibly cut out
    the inappropriate parts. <br />
  </p>

<p>my last name isn&#8217;t wong, nor do i really care for cosmetic products that cost $180 HKD (~$30 CDN) to make my skin whiter. boy, if they had sales people like they do here, people would be buying like crazy; so much pressure (though i guess a point goes to them for service). it&#8217;s funny though, in north america, many go to tanning beds and slather on copper/bronzers or tanning lotions to achieve a golden tan (ie. read dark skin), whereas in korea and especially in hong kong, they use every sort of milk lotion and facial products to achieve white, fair skin. i&#8217;m not sure what&#8217;s healthier &#8211; bleaching your skin with peroxide (hypothesizing) or soaking in uv rays. why can&#8217;t either be content with their own colour of skin?</p>

<p>at this time of the year, korea is blooming with cherry blossoms and springtime weather. the first few days, i had culture shock: 99% of Koreans cannot understand or speak English very well. if we didn&#8217;t join a local tour (which by the way, consisted of a tour guide who told very engaging stories), we&#8217;d be lost especially with the sheer size of seoul and its surrounding areas. diet of koreans consists mainly of kimchi (over 200 kinds), white steamed rice, and soup much of which are all extremely spicy. because most foreigners cannot withstand the spice, they tone down the food for us at the siteseeing restaurants (yes, believe it or not, there are restaurants that especially cater to tour groups). by the end of the trip, i was starting to decipher some korean and remembered how to say thank you.
