What most people don&#8217;t know about me is that I only hold my chopsticks correctly when I am in Hong Kong.<br />
After 2.5 weeks of travelling and after experiencing much turbulence on a boat and multiple times on a plane, I am glad to be home. I didn&#8217;t seem to suffer from severe jetlag, which is likely because I regulated my sleep.<br />
The itinerary:</p>
<ul>
<li>Kitchener &#8211; (Calgary) &#8211; Vancouver</li>
<li>Vancouver &#8211; (Seoul) &#8211; Beijing</li>
<li>Beijing &#8211; Xian</li>
<li>Xian &#8211; Shanghai</li>
<li>Shanghai &#8211; Hong Kong</li>
<li>Hong Kong &#8211; Macau &#8211; Hong Kong</li>
<li>Hong Kong &#8211; (Seoul) &#8211; Vancouver</li>
<li>Vancouver &#8211; (Calgary) &#8211; Kitchener</li>
</ul>
<p>Remarks:</p>
<ul>
<li>What did I do on my trip? It felt like all I did was eat and shop (more eating than shopping).</li>
<li>The key to finding toilets (as opposed to squatting holes) in China is to look for the handicapped stalls.</li>
<li>I understand why people in China prefer simplified Chinese over traditional now &#8211; it&#8217;s so much more easier to read and write! (though, I still prefer traditional).</li>
<li>I get the general sense that natives of China think that every Chinese revolves around China-thinking &#8211; one tour guide implied to my mother that her children should learn their &#8220;mother tongue&#8221; (that is, Mandarin) after learning that we were only fluent in Cantonese; I bit my tongue and refrained from saying that Cantonese was ours.</li>
<li>Thankfully, we left the region neighbouring Sichuan (Xi&#8217;an) and its affected areas (including Shanghai) the day before the earthquake happened.</li>
<li>If we were on earlier flights, we may have experienced plane trouble. Thank God that wasn&#8217;t us.</li>
<li>Weddings in HK seem to be drastically different than Chinese weddings in Canada (and more tiring &#8211; I certainly had different expectations). With the amount of energy it takes for a wedding, it&#8217;s a wonder why people get married more than once.</li>
<li>Tourists ruin the beauty of historical sites, including the Great Wall.</li>
<li>Our tour guide in Beijing is either 26 years old, 31, or neither. He told my sister he was 26, and me, 31.</li>
<li>On the way back, I prayed that customs wouldn&#8217;t ask me questions because I&#8217;m not very good at answering under pressure (see past experience ). The customs officer asked everyone else in my family questions but when it was my turn (I was 2nd), all she really said was how young I looked!</li>
</ul>

I&#8217;m not sure how to go about explaining to people what it is I do to those who may not be familiar with the industry (much less in Chinese if I can&#8217;t even do it in English &#8211; I had a hard time telling people what I did while in HK).		</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				Friday, August 17, 2001 <br />
    As we left the house at 8:54 AM PST, a white VW Beetle drove by and surprised<br />
    us all when we saw that it was a courtesy car from a car dealer. That must<br />
    be a sweet deal for the person who brought her (I&#8217;m assuming, as Beetles are<br />
    more suited as a chic car) car into the shop for repairs-unless of course,<br />
    she was driving a Beetle herself.</p>
<p>9:41 AM <br />
    A riced neon roars by with spoiler/rear wing, body kit, lights, muffler and<br />
    paint job. Very disturbing to the eyes and ears. And if that wasn&#8217;t enough,<br />
    at 11:53 AM, we boarded a plane full of fobs (a big surprise here). One realization<br />
    came to my brother and I though. The Hongers cannot be fobs, b/c they didn&#8217;t<br />
    get off the plane to land in HK, so does that mean we, the CBCs, are fobs<br />
    in HK?! </p>
<p>A small A340. I cannot tell the difference between that and a 767. But it<br />
    seemed scarier that a plane that is almost the same size as the 767 (the plane<br />
    that took me from Ontario to British Columbia), would carry me 12 hours to<br />
    HK! Prior to takeoff, I sneaked a magazine off the executive-class (I think)<br />
    shelf and shocked my mother into asking me if my &#8220;boyfriends&#8221; in<br />
    Ottawa were interested in cars, because it was entitled, &#8220;Car &amp; Driver&#8221;-there<br />
    are some interesting things in that magazine. It beats the one on street racing<br />
    and car parts that my brother bought before we boarded. </p>
<p>Saturday, August 18, 2001 </p>
<p>17:05 HK Standard Time <br />
    Heat wasn&#8217;t too bad the first day. It kinda reminded me of extreme Ottawa<br />
    heat at 32 C (excluding humidity). </p>
<p>21:00 <br />
    Dinner at some restaurant that I have never been to-probably because my grandfather<br />
    would have never approved of this food and &#8220;low classness&#8221; if he<br />
    was still around. I enjoyed my first quail from HK (since 98), and had yummy<br />
    &#8220;tong choy&#8221; (or &#8220;oong choy&#8221;), even though I just had some<br />
    before I left Ottawa. </p>
<p>I actually went shopping in HK. My first stop was at Bossini, where I proceeded<br />
    to buy clothes that actually fit me! At $6 CDN, the black cubic-zuchornia<br />
    (however you spell that word-in any case, they remind me of diamonds), strapped<br />
    top was definitely a good bargain! In HK, the exchange rate was on the average<br />
    about $5 HKD: $1 CDN. I can&#8217;t believe that in HK, of all places, there are<br />
    actually people who rice their cars-whatever for?! By the way, in case you<br />
    don&#8217;t understand some Ottawa lingo-like my brother, I will explain some terms<br />
    here and there: &#8220;rice&#8221; is the same thing as &#8220;soup&#8221; or<br />
    &#8220;accessorize&#8221; when it comes to cars. </p>
<p>23:00 <br />
    Why, you ask, am I using army or Quebec style of time?! Actually, I&#8217;m not<br />
    sure. I think I picked it up in one of the mystery books that I useta read<br />
    and I liked that system because it&#8217;s so unique and causes less confusion.<br />
    I remember that in Waterloo, Carey used it many times to organize cell group<br />
    meetings and all, and even though I had to constantly subtract the last digit<br />
    by 2, to determine the time, it kinda stuck. </p>
<p>Surprising, I went to bed by 23:00. I was tired. But not really jet-lagged<br />
    b/c I didn&#8217;t wake up &#8217;til the next morning (unlike in &#8217;93 when I woke up at<br />
    4:00 and couldn&#8217;t go back to sleep). </p>
<p>Sunday, August 19, 2001 </p>
<p>I started having dreams again. That night, I dreamt that that I was on the<br />
    verge of missing my third exam in the examination period. I was talking to<br />
    Jen (Waterloo classmate at one point in time and good friend), and suddenly<br />
    realised that it was the 17th, and that I had exams scheduled on the 15th,<br />
    16th, 17th, 30th, and 31st of August. I was supposed to be writing a geometry<br />
    test on that day and was freaking out b/c all of my finals were worth 40%<br />
    (sounds like high school!) and I had already missed 2. </p>
<p>That morning, at around 10:30, we headed to a Whampoa Alliance Church, a<br />
    small Chinese church that played really old contemporary music and hymns,<br />
    much more older than OCAC&#8217;s style of worship. The funny thing is that the<br />
    name, &#8220;Whampoa&#8221;, actually sounds more Flip or of some other ethnicity<br />
    other than Chinese. The sermon was considerably easy to understand, considering<br />
    I had my Palm with me with the NIV bible on it, and the speaker was talking<br />
    about the Prayer of Jabez. All I needed to do was to read my newly acquired<br />
    book, The Prayer of Jabez, a gift from the Billy Graham Ministry, to understand<br />
    the whole sermon. What shocked me, when I read the book, was that the pastor<br />
    took everything from the book, including the analogies. </p>
<p>Lunch at 12:50. I have never realised that a Chinese custom of reserving<br />
    a table is to stand behind a seated party and wait for them to leave before<br />
    you grab their seats. I&#8217;ve realised why Dom says that he&#8217;s sick of Chinese<br />
    food-you can only have so much dim sum before you get sick of it too. Especially<br />
    if you have dim sum for breakfast, dim sum for lunch . . . thank God that<br />
    it wasn&#8217;t dim sum for dinner! Although, we did go to a restaurant across the<br />
    street from our place for dinner, that DOES serve dim sum during the day.<br />
    <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> </p>
<p>Upon arriving to that restaurant at 19:47, memories flooded me as I recalled<br />
    having some tea or some sauce spilt on me by the waiter in 98-that was when<br />
    I realised how effective Shout (shout it out!) was and I have been using it<br />
    ever since (great way for some advertising eh? :P). I think my grandmother<br />
    is a VIP customer there, because the service was so good and the waitresses<br />
    knew her name (well, last name anyhow). They offered tea 4 times, because<br />
    we were drinking sugar cane juice instead. Yum! </p>
<p>My sister, being a Broadway freak, decided to sing a song from Annie, in<br />
    the middle of the evening, and for the rest of the night, I had the chorus,<br />
    &#8220;It&#8217;s a hard-knocked life . . .&#8221; going around in my head-not the<br />
    actual song mind you, but the one that Silq kept playing in Ottawa. </p>
<p>During that day, I made a couple of general observations: </p>
<p>My brother kept wanting to play with my Palm. <br />
    There are really odd-looking cars in HK, and cars that aren&#8217;t seen here in<br />
    Canada, like the Mitsubishi Lancer. <br />
    Internet withdrawal is no fun at all. And even though there is a cyber café<br />
    right next door, my parents didn&#8217;t think it was safe for me to wander down<br />
    there. <br />
    Monday, August 20, 2001 <br />
    Another night of strange dreams including a portion where I was shooting at<br />
    people with a gun made of Lego, and another, where I was at a banquet with<br />
    a family (parents) I didn&#8217;t know very well with one other person I knew I<br />
    think. </p>
<p>Off to Ocean Park we went. My third time there (&#8217;82, &#8217;93, &#8217;01), but this<br />
    time, we went with our cousins and my aunt. That day, I decided to wear shorts<br />
    (because it was very sunny and hot). It was a good and a bad thing: the good<br />
    part was that I was able to get a slight tan line (which seems to have disappeared<br />
    already), and the bad was that I managed to obtain 5 very itchy mosquito bites-all<br />
    at one ride: the Raging River. Consequently, I never wore shorts outdoors<br />
    again during my trip. The Raging River was located under trees (provides the<br />
    bugs shade), and it had really dirty water (nice place for them to lurk),<br />
    but the ride was fun-didn&#8217;t close my eyes this time when we dropped! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> The<br />
    Dragon, which is a roller coaster boasting to be the biggest in HK, was once<br />
    again fun and this time, I didn&#8217;t close my eyes for the loops as I did in<br />
    93, either ;). The Flying Swing is much like the one at PNE/Playland-very<br />
    calm and soothing. However, the virtual ride does not compare to the one in<br />
    Universal Studios, Hollywood at all! This one lasted maybe a mere 5 minutes<br />
    and it wasn&#8217;t too &#8220;extreme&#8221; (too bad). One funny incident that almost<br />
    costed my mother her ankle, was that we were talking about bats and all of<br />
    a sudden, a couple of black butterflies flew around us, and I screamed, &#8220;BAT!&#8221;-heheh,<br />
    my mom freaked. </p>
<p>Dinner was spent at my aunt&#8217;s. Her maid cooked up some yummy meal, and surprised<br />
    us all because when she first started her job at my aunt/uncle&#8217;s place, she<br />
    didn&#8217;t know how to cook so she read off some cookbooks that my aunt bought<br />
    for her (b/c she useta be a supervisor for the rest of the maids at some temperamental,<br />
    rich famous guy&#8217;s place). I later realised how well off that area was, especially<br />
    with so many nice cars, and a somewhat famous singer by the name of Shirley<br />
    Kwan (admittedly, whom I have never heard) that lives next-door. </p>
<p>Tuesday, August 21, 2001 </p>
<p>More interesting dreams. One of them I attended a small church fellowship<br />
    in HK and one of the guys made me feel welcome and asked me where I was from,<br />
    etc. etc. </p>
<p>Cold water showers are so much warmer than cold water showers at night. I<br />
    don&#8217;t like taking cold showers in general, but I didn&#8217;t know how to work the<br />
    hot water. I later realised that you had to wait a couple of minutes before<br />
    each tiny change of temperature would take into effect. </p>
<p>I accompanied my mother and my aunt and my sister in hopes that I would be<br />
    able to buy something while my mom was shopping for shoes. Unfortunately,<br />
    she literally stuck to the plan and for many hours straight, all we did was<br />
    look at shoes. Thankfully, I managed to purchase something, not exactly what<br />
    I was looking for (clothes), but oh well, a pair of sandals for $20 CDN is<br />
    still pretty good :). Thankfully, we got a break from shopping in the evening,<br />
    when we went bowling at the Hong Kong Cricket Club that my aunt&#8217;s family belongs<br />
    to in Happy Valley. Yes, my aunt&#8217;s garage alone in Happy Valley is home to<br />
    some nice cars: Audi TT, Porsche Boxter, a Ferrari of some sort. Others that<br />
    zoom by include Z3s, s2000s, and 911s, MR2 (not Spyder though). Skyline seen<br />
    in Tsim Sha Tsui. </p>
<p>Wednesday, August 22, 2001 </p>
<p>I think I&#8217;m a l&#8217;il &#8220;Ottawa&#8221;-sick because my dreams that evening,<br />
    had Dom, Josh, and Marc in them. In one of my dreams, I figured that if &#8220;Melancholy&#8221;<br />
    didn&#8217;t have such a depressing association with it, it would be a nice name<br />
    b/c it&#8217;s 4 syllables in length and one could shorten it to &#8220;Mel&#8221;.
  </p>
<p>Today, we went bowling yet again. I seem to only bowl well with a 9 lb bowling<br />
    ball. The unfortunate thing was that there was only 1 of those available to<br />
    be shared w 4 lanes. Everything else ends up in the gutter. Sigh :\. I don&#8217;t<br />
    think I&#8217;ve ever bowled this many times in a week before. </p>
<p>We also went to the CityPlaza Shopping Centre and while my mom shopped for<br />
    shoes, my sis and I decided to explore the rest of the place and discovered<br />
    that the Disney Store had a closing sale and everything was ½ price<br />
    off the lowest ticketed price!! We were lucky (I don&#8217;t believe in luck) because<br />
    2 days after when we went again, it was already closed. I bought a couple<br />
    of items, including a Mulan VHS video (in Cantonese) for $8 CDN. However,<br />
    in my AV ignorance, I didn&#8217;t realise that the videos in HK could not play<br />
    in Canadian VCRs unless one has a dual VCR (which we don&#8217;t). I also bought<br />
    two ¾-sleeve shirts for $9 CDN each at U2. </p>
<p>Thursday, August 23, 2001 </p>
<p>Our family and my grandmother left HK early to take the train to Shenzhen<br />
    (45 min to 1 hr train ride). I think I understand why we like to stereotype<br />
    &#8220;big green&#8221; people-most have a less sophisticated lifestyle than<br />
    the average HK resident. If you ask me to go to Shenzhen again, I think I&#8217;d<br />
    have to think twice. </p>
<p>We stopped at a restaurant for some lunch. There, I discovered that using<br />
    tea to wash dishes in TO or Ottawa is nothing compared to what they do in<br />
    China; they actually give you a bowl of tea to rinse your dishes in before<br />
    they take the dirty tea bowl away. And I thought that was bad. The dim sum<br />
    is the most disgusting restaurant food I&#8217;ve had in a very long time! I refused<br />
    to eat the pork spareribs because my mom told me that they went bad, and my<br />
    shark-fin dumpling soup tasted like &#8220;soap water&#8221; (gan-sui). Most<br />
    people in Shenzhen speak Mandarin (and only understand Mandarin) now, even<br />
    though this was originally a place of Canton descent. Getting around this<br />
    area would be difficult if one did not know any Chinese at all. The maid (who<br />
    is 23 years old), at the place where I was staying, was surprised to learn<br />
    that I did not speak or know any Mandarin (well, &#8220;any&#8221; is almost<br />
    right considering China Mandarin is not what I know). I don&#8217;t think she realises<br />
    that in Canada, not every &#8220;jook sing&#8221; is bilingual in Cantonese<br />
    and Mandarin. And if a &#8220;jook sing&#8221; is fluent in one of these dialects,<br />
    that is already pretty impressive in itself. </p>
<p>Shopping. Negotiating is not something I&#8217;m professionally good at-so I leave<br />
    all the negotiating with my mom. Somehow, we ended up negotiating a cell-phone<br />
    cover from 10 RMB (Ren Men Bi?-China currency is 10% less than HK) to about<br />
    6 RMB (that&#8217;s around $1 CDN). In retrospect, I believe that we could&#8217;ve done<br />
    better. Ah well. It&#8217;s only $1. </p>
<p>That night, we went to some cultural centre to view a costume poetic performance.<br />
    Many tourists from HK were there. Thankfully, it took place indoors (w mild<br />
    AC) so we didn&#8217;t die in the heat. The mini bus system is crazy there! They<br />
    squished at least 50 people in a 16 or-so-seats mini bus. I almost suffocated<br />
    in there. </p>
<p>I can probably say that a missions trip to China was very appealing to me<br />
    until I went on this 1-day trip. I don&#8217;t think I can stand having to live<br />
    without toilets for a month or so. Even though at some places, the holes in<br />
    the floor are flushable and are surrounded with ceramic, I&#8217;m just thankful<br />
    that I was paranoid enough to bring a roll of toilet paper w me from Vancouver<br />
    ;P. Well, there&#8217;s always Kleenex packs, but I don&#8217;t like using them. The technique<br />
    of peeing in a hole. Well, anyhow, I envy the guys when it comes to this.
  </p>
<p>Friday, August 24, 2001 </p>
<p>After spending a very hot night (the AC shut off in the middle of the night)<br />
    trying to sleep on a sofa bed (hard plywood board at the top and soft at bottom),<br />
    my mom, sis and I decided to leave early b/c we couldn&#8217;t stand the heat (yeah,<br />
    I know we&#8217;re wimps/high maintenance). There was a heatstroke warning that<br />
    day anyhow. I don&#8217;t think we would&#8217;ve survived if we were to go the &#8220;Small<br />
    World&#8221; park of the miniature wonders/landmarks of the world. </p>
<p>Spent the evening at my aunts after s&#8217;more shopping. I bought 2 pairs of<br />
    semi-casual sandals for $10 CDN each (nice but they have heels that are waay<br />
    too high for me-well, at least I can now be at least 2.5 inches taller! :)).<br />
    Boy, is HK so much cooler in comparison to Shenzhen! </p>
<p>Saturday, August 25, 2001 </p>
<p>This time, my dreams had Peon, Marc, Jon, Dom, and Josh in it. Peon asked<br />
    me a strange question but I can&#8217;t remember what it was exactly or why she<br />
    asked it. </p>
<p>In the evening, I met up with Jen Lam at Causeway Bay after a morning of<br />
    shopping at Wan Chai (bought a shoulder bag for a mere $4 CDN) and an afternoon<br />
    of bowling. It was our first time in HK without people taking us around, so<br />
    it was an adventure. I took Jen shoe shopping (because I was there earlier<br />
    in the week when my mom was looking for shoes-the reason why she looks for<br />
    shoes like mad is because she&#8217;s only a size 34 (4-5) and not many stores carry<br />
    that size) and Jen took me to the Hello Kitty Café to eat dinner. It&#8217;s<br />
    a very &#8220;cute&#8221; café. Everything is Hello Kitty-from the tables/chairs<br />
    to the food itself-the &#8220;soy&#8221; meat in the noodles were shaped in<br />
    the face of Hello Kitty. </p>
<p>I think if I didn&#8217;t meet up with Jen that day, I wouldn&#8217;t have been able<br />
    to find such good deals in HK b/c we ended up stopping at U2 and we bought<br />
    the same pair of pants ($8 CDN though the price tag said $12CDN/$60 HKD)-except<br />
    she commented that I gained weight b/c she fits a M and I had to take an XL<br />
    b/c they had no more L left and usually, we&#8217;re about the same size in weight<br />
    and height :P. I also grabbed one ¾-sleeve long-sleeves for $6 CDN,<br />
    and 2 v-necked T&#8217;s (style like my white one but w/o buttons) for $2.40 CDN<br />
    each. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> I think she bought a T too, cept she chose one size smaller than<br />
    what I had (because I don&#8217;t like it when it shrinks in the dryer). </p>
<p>Sunday, August 26, 2001 </p>
<p>After church that morning, we decided to see the Whampoa mall, which has<br />
    a very unique architectural design-a cruise ship structure-very interesting,<br />
    especially when you can see it from the harbour. On the StarCruise Leo, we<br />
    were able to see this mall smack in the middle of residential buildings, looking<br />
    as if it was a scene from Speed II. </p>
<p>The StarCruise Leo-first time on a cruise. First impression of lobby area:<br />
    woah, this is like a hotel (somehow it reminded me of West Ed Mall)! Each<br />
    ship of the company is named after an astrological star/constellation, but<br />
    my brother made an interesting comment, &#8220;What about StarCruise Cancer?!&#8221;<br />
    as he noticed that his &#8220;sign&#8221; was missing from the fleet). During<br />
    that entire day, I felt like I was coming down with something because I felt<br />
    like throwing up because my stomach was quite wheezy-and during the previous<br />
    night, while my sister was warm in her sleep, I was freezing cold. It didn&#8217;t<br />
    help that I still feel the ship move, even in mild weather. </p>
<p>During this trip, I developed an interesting theory on why I don&#8217;t like airplanes<br />
    rides. I think it&#8217;s because it&#8217;s constantly rocking/moving, and one&#8217;s enclosed<br />
    in such a tight space. Not to mention that whenever I fall asleep, I&#8217;m half<br />
    self-conscious b/c of where my head goes-if it leans over to the next person,<br />
    if it falls forward, etc. </p>
<p>There&#8217;s not too much to do on a cruise ship. Internet access is $8 CDN for<br />
    ½ hr and everything else (such as arcades) require money as well. The<br />
    only thing I did that day was &#8220;swim&#8221; (or splashed around -that&#8217;s<br />
    more like it), saw a dance/acrobatics stage show (with Vegas showgirls but<br />
    they, thankfully, had clothes on in this session) where in one act, a woman<br />
    used a bow and arrow to shoot an apple off of her own head! Very dangerous<br />
    indeed. </p>
<p>Monday, August 27, 2001 </p>
<p>Around noon, we arrived at Sayan Hainan Island, China. Our family joined<br />
    a bus tour to a big Buddhist temple. We made a bathroom stop along the way-you<br />
    know, the places where the tour guides and the company has an agreement that<br />
    if we buy into what they are trying to sell us (this time it&#8217;s &#8220;lian-zhi&#8221;<br />
    leaves), the tour guides get a percentage of commission. The ladies seem to<br />
    be the ones that target you-they try to push you to buy their products like<br />
    crazy. Anyhow, I can&#8217;t believe I went to the bathroom here; I had to endure<br />
    another &#8220;holy&#8221; one. See, if I knew that the temple actually had<br />
    toilets, I probably would&#8217;ve used those instead. Sigh. </p>
<p>Sheesh, the roads there are worse than those in Montréal-tons of potholes<br />
    that shoot you to the ceiling. I was really tired so I managed to catch a<br />
    wink of sleep because I was extremely tired that day. There was not much to<br />
    see at the temple. However, I did learn that they were starting to build an<br />
    idol/statue that would reach higher than the Statue of Liberty in New York.<br />
    That&#8217;s crazy. Next, they&#8217;ll probably repeat the story of the Tower of Babel<br />
    as told in Genesis. The vegetarian meal was done quite well though at the<br />
    local temple restaurant. Much of the texture of the imitation meat (soy) was<br />
    very close and it tasted quite like the flavour of the meat dish. </p>
<p>On our way back, the tour bus let us stop to try some &#8220;tea&#8221;-one<br />
    kind of tea they let the group try was made from &#8220;foo-gua&#8221; (bitter<br />
    melon). It tasted very interesting. There were other bitter teas that they<br />
    brewed, but after we tried them all, the ladies once again tried to sell them<br />
    to us-I can&#8217;t believe that a can of tea leaves would cost at least $80 CDN!
  </p>
<p>By the time we boarded on the ship again, it was around 19:02. I was somewhat<br />
    hungry again, and during dinner, my sister and I ate a 3 course Western meal,<br />
    while my parents and my brother chose the Chinese set menu. According to my<br />
    sister, I apparently &#8220;eat a lot&#8221;-she said that I used to eat less<br />
    than she did. Well, if that is the case, I&#8217;m grateful for a high metabolism<br />
    rate then, because I haven&#8217;t gained much (if any) for many years now :). </p>
<p>After an evening show at the theatre (which included a synchronised light<br />
    and music show, and an elderly lady in the audience energetically following<br />
    the cast dancing to the YMCA onstage-which was mighty impressive), my sis<br />
    and I decided to check out the small casino that was on the ship with my mom<br />
    in tow. As we arrived at the door, the security guards asked us &#8220;young<br />
    ladies&#8221; to step aside (you see, the age of majority is 18 there so my<br />
    sis wanted to take the opportunity to see something like this before she heads<br />
    back to Canada and waits another year). As my mother waited for a cross-reference<br />
    check (asked us for our access cards and called security office) on her kids,<br />
    my sister in a stage-whisper loudly proclaims to me, &#8220;But, you&#8217;re 21!&#8221;<br />
    &#8216;Twas quite amusing because I don&#8217;t think the security guard actually believed<br />
    her because he turned to take a glance at me, considering I think he probably<br />
    thought my sister was older than I was-and until the reference confirmed that<br />
    we were of legal age. All he said was, &#8220;Thank you,&#8221; as we walked<br />
    off smirking. </p>
<p>Tuesday, August 28, 2001 </p>
<p>This time, my dreams contained Melody C., and Ben C. in them (they are not<br />
    related. Melody is from my high school and Ben is from UW). </p>
<p>At 7:30, the ship docks in Danang, Vietnam and we disembark for another tour.<br />
    This time, we joined a bus/walking tour to the local museums and embroidery<br />
    shops/galleries. </p>
<p>Impressions of Central Vietnam (first time in Vietnam): </p>
<p>Many signs of a developing (poor) country/city. <br />
    Too many motorbikes/cycles/scooters zooming on the roads. <br />
    Driving a bus or any type of vehicle is like playing the arcade game, &#8220;Crazy<br />
    Taxi&#8221;. Sitting in the front seat of the bus is very scary. All you see<br />
    is the bus getting so close to these bikes and most of the riders aren&#8217;t even<br />
    wearing proper helmets (and to think that in China, we saw the remains of<br />
    a bike accident w the helmet on the ground and the body gone). <br />
    There are too many people on the streets trying to sell goods to the tourists,<br />
    especially to the foreigners (ie. Non-Asian) because they don&#8217;t know how to<br />
    bargain with their prices/products. They know that it&#8217;s illegal to sell on<br />
    private property, so they loiter around the building until we step onto the<br />
    street, and then they start hounding us again, trying to make us pity them.<br />
    Actually, I was lucky, I didn&#8217;t get bugged even though the rest of my family<br />
    did (including my sister). I have a couple of theories on why: A) I followed<br />
    behind the Australians (so to lose the focus) or B) I don&#8217;t look like I have<br />
    any money on me b/c I still look young. These peddlers are willing to follow<br />
    us around for blocks! <br />
    Food in this part of Vietnam definitely does not compare to pho in Canada.<br />
    Maybe we were not served the best, but the pho and spring rolls are really<br />
    gross compared to the Canadian Vietnamese food. However, dragon fruit has<br />
    a very interesting taste to it. <br />
    At this point, I concluded that I felt fat (for once). All we ever did on<br />
    the cruise was eat, eat, and eat. No time to digest. I remember that towards<br />
    the end, I kept feeling hungry 1 hour after I ate a meal, even though I knew<br />
    that I just ate. Thankfully, I don&#8217;t think I gained any, if much. If I did,<br />
    it&#8217;s only a maximum of 1 lb. (but unfortunately, it would be in the wrong<br />
    areas). </p>
<p>Back at the ship, we watched Cast Away, starring Tom Hanks and featuring<br />
    Helen Hunt (I wonder if Dom has this one). I didn&#8217;t like it b/c I almost fell<br />
    asleep-the storyline went a l&#8217;il too slow for my liking, and we had to endure<br />
    1 hour of monologue w/o any musical background. I don&#8217;t understand why they<br />
    chose to feature this film though, due to the fact that we were, afterall,<br />
    on a cruise and the weather was becoming stormy. Well, at least they didn&#8217;t<br />
    show Titanic (although the drills they had at the beginning had life jackets<br />
    much like those on the Titanic). </p>
<p>Stormy weather. Not very pleasant on a cruise. I decided to be adventurous<br />
    so I went outside alone, but it wasn&#8217;t a very good move because I almost was<br />
    stuck out there. The winds were so high (not to mention that it was starting<br />
    to rain) that the main doors were steeled shut and the smaller doors were<br />
    soooo hard to pull back open b/c of the air/wind pressure or something. I<br />
    had to pull with all my might. I think it was also around then that I decided<br />
    to go down to the Captain&#8217;s bridge again (pretty much an area where you can<br />
    see the &#8220;cockpit&#8221; if you were in a plane) to see what it was like<br />
    up front. Guess what? They turned off one of their radars, and they were using<br />
    binoculars to see! I was like, uh-oh, that doesn&#8217;t seem right. There must<br />
    be a lot of fog or something-glad no icebergs got in the way <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f61b.png" alt="😛" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> </p>
<p>During the evening, I beat my brother at the arcades (racing a Celica vs.<br />
    NS-X or something and out-cycled my brother on the physical virtual bike race).<br />
    I slept well that night, but most of my family members didn&#8217;t because the<br />
    ship was rocking too heavily. </p>
<p>Wednesday, August 29, 2001 </p>
<p>Surprisingly, I didn&#8217;t experience sea sickness, but my sister got mildy sick<br />
    and we saw the remnants of someone&#8217;s breakfast on the carpet. </p>
<p>This time, we spent another $6 CDN on arcades (that&#8217;s $3 each) and my brother<br />
    beat my choice of car (MR2) and beat me on the bike by 1 second or so. Ah<br />
    well. You win some, you lose some. </p>
<p>We docked and disembarked around 16:00. Does it ever feel good to be on land<br />
    again :). Oddly (psychological effects I suppose), on occasions, I still felt<br />
    the floor moving as if I was still at sea. After my first time on a cruise,<br />
    I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll be too overly excited to go on another cruise again. Firstly,<br />
    there&#8217;s not much to do on a ship that cannot be done elsewhere on land (as<br />
    everything isn&#8217;t free), you don&#8217;t get to visit too many exciting places, and<br />
    all you do is eat. I think that because it&#8217;s a Chinese tour group, that it&#8217;s<br />
    also very noisy and rude (especially when they&#8217;re all fighting for buffet<br />
    food). </p>
<p>Eew. I don&#8217;t think I will ever dare to drink wine that contains dead, preserved<br />
    baby mice. That&#8217;s what my grandmother has in one of her shelves. Gives me<br />
    the creeps even though I don&#8217;t mind dissecting these rodents. </p>
<p>Thursday, August 30, 2001 </p>
<p>During the previous evening, it started to really pour in HK. Even the ceilings<br />
    in our apartment started to leak (and annoyed me to death as I was trying<br />
    to sleep and all I could hear was plink-plink into the buckets). </p>
<p>I actually spotted the first VW beetle on the roads of HK today. It seems<br />
    like a rare sight for some reason. We spent lunch at this expensive dim sum<br />
    place with my mother&#8217;s church friend from her high school years in HK. He<br />
    happens to be a taxi driver, and the last time we were w him (&#8217;87), my sister<br />
    threw up in his car on the way down/up the Peak b/c she got carsick. </p>
<p>36 guests came out to my grandmother&#8217;s 80th birthday celebration. The bill<br />
    came to a close $1720 CDN (works out to be $47 CDN + $4 CDN &#8220;lai see&#8221;/<br />
    &#8220;hong bao&#8221;/ red pocket per guest). The cake (from Maxim&#8217;s) itself<br />
    costed $1000 HKD ($200 CDN). What a rip-off, considering there was not much<br />
    fruit-filling in the cake and the texture wasn&#8217;t all that good. I realised<br />
    that wedding banquets must cost a fortune then considering that there is often<br />
    a lot of guests, decorations, hired hands, and food and alcohol consumed.
  </p>
<p>That night, my dad killed a cockroach the length of my middle finger (at<br />
    least and much fatter than that as well). Thankfully, that&#8217;s the first one<br />
    I actually saw in the house. </p>
<p>Friday, August 31, 2001 </p>
<p>Yaay! We were finally returning to Vancouver today (as you can tell, I don&#8217;t<br />
    like HK too much)! During the night, I ended up rolling off the couch and<br />
    was about to hit the floor if my suitcase wasn&#8217;t in the way to block my fall.<br />
    I think I rolled over in my sleep a bit too far b/c I was dreaming that I<br />
    was twirling or something. </p>
<p>The plane ride back home was very turbulent. At one point, my stomach was<br />
    doing flip-flops (because I felt like we kept falling), and so I started becoming<br />
    paranoid when I saw the flight attendants actually strapped into theirs seats<br />
    as well; I thought that we were going to die. In my paranoia, I decided to<br />
    pray and ended up thinking of the results if I was to die. Somehow, I asked<br />
    God to give me the opportunity to give me a chance to witness to my friend<br />
    from high school even more. So, I guess I should taken whatever opportunity<br />
    comes to me since we arrived in Vancouver 1 hour early :). </p>
<p>That&#8217;s my trip and this has been one long read (incomprehensive at times<br />
    I&#8217;m sure). <br />
    Thanks for staying this far. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> </p>
<p>Until next time, <br />
    This is L&#8217;il Miss Bo-Peep signing off.

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Note to my friends who have been praying for me during my<br />
    trip in Hong Kong: THANKS <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> </p>
<p>Day One: Monday, August 10, 1998 (Pacific Standard Time); Tuesday, August<br />
    11, 1998 (Hong Kong Time Zone)<br />
    8:45 am: Becky Chan telephones my sister to say good-bye to her before she<br />
    leaves for work. That is my wake-up call. 5 minutes later, my sister comes<br />
    into my room to tell me to wake up and get ready to leave as my father had<br />
    relayed the message to Sheila in the middle of Becky&#8217;s call. That&#8217;s what BC<br />
    Tel&#8217;s call waiting is for I guess. </p>
<p>I don&#8217;t remember when we arrived at the airport but we got there safely.<br />
    Pastor Joshua accompanied us as he was going to take our van back to our house<br />
    for us. After we had checked-in with Air Canada, we had time for some lunch<br />
    as we knew the plane food wasn&#8217;t going to be that pleasant. My family had<br />
    Burger King and some Fortune Wok (or some kind of Wok food) . . .I on the<br />
    other hand couldn&#8217;t eat anything but an apple because ever since Saturday,<br />
    I had encountered a stomach virus (accompanied by a fever) and whenever I<br />
    ate, the food didn&#8217;t stay in my digestive tract for very long (not that you<br />
    wanted to know). I shall spare you the details, but let&#8217;s just say that I&#8217;m<br />
    thankful that I didn&#8217;t vomit because I hate vomiting. </p>
<p>The A343 plane lifted-off approximately at 1:00 p.m. I barely got a chance<br />
    to sleep on the plane. I had prayed beforehand that my stomach would last<br />
    until I got off the plane and God answered another prayer! When I was completely<br />
    healed was another thing, another day. Perhaps that was why my appetite wasn&#8217;t<br />
    that big (it was God&#8217;s doing)&#8211;I only had 8 slices (or pieces) of Premium<br />
    Plus crackers and hot water as I couldn&#8217;t eat any of the plane food (thank<br />
    goodness, though the sushi sure looked good). I didn&#8217;t even have enough appetite<br />
    to eat the apple that we bought at the airport last minute that totaled to<br />
    (all currency is in Canadian) $1.00. </p>
<p>13 hours and 22 minutes. What a long plane ride, but to pass much of the<br />
    time, they showed some TV sitcoms: Seinfield, Spin City, some documentary<br />
    on American lobsters, CBC News, some music videos, and 4 movies (Aerovision<br />
    Movie Presentations): The Lucky Guy (some Chinese movie), Sliding Doors, Wag<br />
    The Dog (I thought that Wag the Dog was about a dog, not politics!), and The<br />
    Real Howard Spitz. They weren&#8217;t supposed to show The Real Howard Spitz but<br />
    I guess they had too much time on their hands. They had music to listen to<br />
    as well, and my sister found a Christian Contemporary and Gospel music station<br />
    with songs from Avalon, DC Talk, Amy Grant, Michael W. Smith, Jars of Clay,<br />
    and other artists I haven&#8217;t heard of&#8211;they were the gospel songs. </p>
<p>The Hong Kong International airport was a big place! They had electronic/computerized<br />
    trains that ran from one part of the airport to the other (probably because<br />
    it would&#8217;ve taken too long to walk from one end to the other. However there<br />
    were many things that were still in the process of repair/construction (e.g.<br />
    a moving sidewalk). I also wanted to find the places where they had shiny<br />
    marbled floor tiles that when one looked down, (s)he could see the reflection<br />
    of people walking. If someone was wearing a skirt, one could&#8217;ve seen beneath<br />
    it. I didn&#8217;t come across one then, but on the way back I inspected it and<br />
    I could see my reflection quite clearly. Thank goodness that I wasn&#8217;t wearing<br />
    a skirt, just jeans. </p>
<p>It took us 1.5 hours to get home in traffic. We could&#8217;ve taken a taxi that<br />
    would&#8217;ve come to $60-$80 or an electric train and then transferred to the<br />
    MTR (subway transit) but that was too inconvenient. The double decker bus<br />
    fare for the family was $30. </p>
<p>After we arrived, our grandfather (you see only he was there because my aunt<br />
    and her kids went to China and my grandmother and my uncles were in Guam)<br />
    took us out to dinner but all I had was plain rice because I still couldn&#8217;t<br />
    eat properly (yum). By the time we got home, it was nearly 10 p.m. but even<br />
    though it&#8217;s not that late, we were all really tired so we went to bed really<br />
    soon. </p>
<p>
    Day Two: Wednesday, August 12, 1998 (Hong Kong Time Zone)<br />
    6:59 am: Pitter-patter . . .drip, drip, drip . . .the pouring rain woke me<br />
    up so I got up to adjust the air-conditioner. My brother also woke up so we<br />
    turned on the television to see if there were any Chinese cartoons on. However,<br />
    the only program that kept coming on was the morning news, which kept rerunning<br />
    even up to 8:30 am when we went to wash-up and have breakfast. </p>
<p>Because everyone woke up so early, we decided to go out and walk around to<br />
    see if there were any shops nearby that were open. You wouldn&#8217;t believe it<br />
    if I told you that none of the shops open until 10:30 am at the earliest (but<br />
    they close at 9:30 p.m. or later every night)! We had dim sum at 3 p.m. because<br />
    we had to clean our apartment (it was just newly renovated). We then proceeded<br />
    into probably one of the largest HMVs in Hong Kong (and perhaps the world).<br />
    It had four stories with different types of music located on each floor. At<br />
    the time, there was a &#8220;crazy sale&#8221; so we decided to look to see<br />
    if there were any CDs that were by contemporary Christian artists. Since there<br />
    was no alphabetical order of the artists names in the sale racks, we had to<br />
    spend quite a bit of time flipping through each CD before coming across the<br />
    Newsboys single, &#8216;Take Me To Your Leader&#8217; and Steven Curtis Chapman&#8217;s, &#8216;Signs<br />
    of Life&#8217; (I think my brother found both of them). My sister purchased the<br />
    Newsboys CD that had 5 songs on it including the &#8216;Shine&#8217; remix ($2) and I<br />
    purchased the Steven Curtis Champman one ($10). </p>
<p>In the afternoon, we got a chance to watch a Chinese cartoon &#8216;Ding Dong&#8217;<br />
    or otherwise known as &#8216;Doramoen&#8217; (spelling?). . . I think it was until our<br />
    aunt invited us to dinner in Hong Kong Island (we live in Tsim Sha Tsui, Kowloon).<br />
    We took the Star Ferry across the ocean/sea (?) and had dinner (which I decided<br />
    to take a chance and eat real food&#8211;big mistake). Their apartment is considered<br />
    to be one of the &#8220;well-off&#8221; luxurious ones. It had 4 bedrooms, 2<br />
    bathrooms including full bathtubs and showers with gas-heated hot water tanks,<br />
    1 big storage area/closet, a huge dining table, leather couches, cabled TV<br />
    (my grandparents don&#8217;t own these you see), and a DVD/karoake machine (and<br />
    I forgot also a hired maid). They even are members of certain clubs (you know,<br />
    places where you may use the facilities for approximately $1000 a year). That<br />
    night, the three of us (kids) got a chance to stay overnight and I finally<br />
    decided to suffer and take this disgusting bitter tasting Chinese medicine<br />
    (which contains 50% alcohol, metholaumem, distilled water, cloves, nutmeg,<br />
    and other ingredients) in hopes of ridding that awful reaction I got after<br />
    eating (well, I think it must&#8217;ve worked because I was pretty much okay the<br />
    following day). </p>
<p>
    Day Three: Thursday, August 13, 1998 (Hong Kong Time Zone)<br />
    Um, yeah so I was going on and on about what happened but my screen froze<br />
    and I had to start all over again (from Day 3 to Day 4) and at the same time<br />
    I am watching The Devil&#8217;s Advocate so I am really distracted. Anyway, I seemed<br />
    to have misplaced my notes until the end of summer and it was not until now<br />
    (December 19, 1998) that I am finishing my journal. So that morning, I woke<br />
    up at 10 am to the noise of the kids talking. I spent most of my time being<br />
    bored that day because my cousins had a private tutor over. However, we got<br />
    a chance to go to the stationary store nearby and I got a chance to buy some<br />
    signo milky pens for a good price. That night, we went back across the harbour<br />
    (via the Star Ferry) and went to a restaurant to eat dinner with my mother&#8217;s<br />
    relatives. My, were the dishes ever small!!!!! Never seen such like them!
  </p>
<p>
    Day Four: Friday, August 14, 1998 (Hong Kong Time Zone)<br />
    After breakfast that morning, our family decided to go the science centre<br />
    except it was closed. You see, we have a family membership at Science World<br />
    and so there is free admission to other science centres around the world.<br />
    Because the science centre was still closed, we walked around for awhile.<br />
    My sister, being Sheila, who loves to shop (unlike myself), bought many clothes<br />
    while I just bought a purse (a purse? I thought it was stickers!) Anyway,<br />
    we went to the most non-Chinese place in the world for lunch: McDonald&#8217;s.<br />
    However, the iced lemon tea in the McDonald&#8217;s are only found in Hong Kong<br />
    (well not here anyway). A McCrunch was the latest trend (some pork burger)<br />
    so that is what I had. We proceeded to go to Tom Lee and we ended up buying<br />
    the latest hits music for the piano, flute, trumpet except the music were<br />
    not all in the same key which I didn&#8217;t know then ~ oh well. We finally went<br />
    back to the science centre and quickly looked around-4 floors and I&#8217;m sure<br />
    some of you know that already since I was there in 1993-and went home for<br />
    the night. </p>
<p>
    Day Five: Saturday, August 15, 1998 (Hong Kong Time Zone)<br />
    The adults had a meeting so the kids were stuck downstairs in a room drawing<br />
    and reading and stuff. Wasn&#8217;t my idea of fun but for dim sum, we were able<br />
    to pick what kind of food we wanted =) and so it was good for once! More shopping<br />
    afterwards. Again. The dinner that night was great. Well, it was hilarious.<br />
    We got stuck with some other kids that were staying with my father&#8217;s relatives<br />
    at our own table. They were so annoying at first and they wouldn&#8217;t talk to<br />
    us. Anyway, after one kid threw a napkin and hit a man in the face (sitting<br />
    next to our table), he cried. I didn&#8217;t feel sorry for him even though the<br />
    man got so angry. I thought he deserved it. Apparently, my cousin did and<br />
    she went and tried to cheer him up. Soon enough, he was laughing tears if<br />
    you know what I mean. And once again, they didn&#8217;t believe I was 18. Seriously,<br />
    who does?! One of the girls on my floor when they saw me thought that I was<br />
    16-yeah a genius. I wish. After our very interesting evening, we went home<br />
    and since it was my third uncle&#8217;s birthday, we served him cake. That night<br />
    I think I went to bed early because the next day we had Sunday service at<br />
    8:30 am at the Tsim Sha Tsui Baptist Church which I went to 5 years ago too.
  </p>
<p>
    Day Six: Sunday, August 16, 1998 (Hong Kong Time Zone)<br />
    English service with organ worship and hymns except for Majesty is very different.<br />
    The chairperson doing the announcements was Caucasian but yet it was so impressive<br />
    cuz he was translating from a Chinese printed bulletin! Mom, Sheila and I<br />
    met up with my fourth aunt (the same one who has such a luxurious house) and<br />
    went shopping some more. I finally had a chance to drink some bubble tea ~<br />
    mmmmmmm . . .it&#8217;s so good! Is it only this good in Hong Kong?! Anyway, did<br />
    I ever mention that Hong Kong has this really crazed fad with Hello Kitty?<br />
    It was really annoying. And I tried some &#8220;stinky&#8221; tofu-it&#8217;s not<br />
    as great as what everyone says it is. It&#8217;s kinda sour tasting. Oh, we also<br />
    went to buy some shoes for me. The salespeople all thought that I was not<br />
    more than 14. One of them didn&#8217;t believe that even though my mother told him.<br />
    Sheesh. So I ended up buying (or my mother ended up buying for me) shoes,<br />
    jacket, and I bought a $5 nice T, some more pens. How come I don&#8217;t remember<br />
    eating at a Thai cuisine for dinner? Oh well, if my notes say so then I guess<br />
    that is what we did. And we took the ever so expensive but-not-as-expensive-as-Vancouver-I-don&#8217;t-think<br />
    taxi home. </p>
<p>
    Day Seven: Monday, August 17, 1998 (Hong Kong Time Zone)<br />
    This Monday was a very special day for Hong Kong because it was supposedly<br />
    the date that China chased Japan outta their country or something. Anyway,<br />
    we woke up at 7:30 am because the family was going to meet my mother&#8217;s friend<br />
    for an early dim sum. Apparently, that friend and his wife were going to see<br />
    a movie afterwards, but I forgot which one it was. So we left them alone and<br />
    our aunt came and took us shopping to help my mother buy a dress for the banquet.
  </p>
<p>As the time neared 3:00 p.m. I think (you see both my watches were out-of-order<br />
    so I really have no sense of time), we decided to go to my aunt&#8217;s club for<br />
    lunch. I thought since it was a club, the food would be pretty good so I decided<br />
    to try a shepherd&#8217;s pie. Bad mistake! The pie was quite unappealing because<br />
    it had so much spaghetti-kind meat in it but the orange juice sure tasted<br />
    yummy! </p>
<p>In the late afternoon, we went home and the 3 girls (Sheila, Iris, and I)<br />
    spent the rest of the afternoon picking out jewelry from my grandmother as<br />
    she was very generous in giving away the jewelry she still had from the jewelry<br />
    store they own previously. Dinner rolled by again but this time, we had to<br />
    take the MTR (subway) to Mong Kok (but they pronounce it Wong Kok so I still<br />
    haveta figure that one out). </p>
<p>That evening, the cousins all decided to practice the El Shaddai piece without<br />
    the cassette player for awhile and one of the younger cousins also decided<br />
    to incorporate a VBS song as well. However, since the cassette player wasn&#8217;t<br />
    bought yet, he was going to teach it to us the following day. </p>
<p>At last!!! The hot water tank was finally working (the construction people<br />
    were working at finishing the rest of the house during the day) so I was able<br />
    to take a nice warm shower instead of in freezing (not quite but close to)<br />
    water! =) And the ZZZZ!s came upon me. </p>
<p>
    Day Eight: Tuesday, August 18, 1998 (Hong Kong Time Zone)<br />
    Woke up. (duh). Sat around doing nothing after breakfast. Went to lunch with<br />
    my &#8220;dai&#8221; aunt&#8217;s mother and father. Our family then went to a Chinese<br />
    Christian bookstore. I was going to buy some Chinese memory verse cards that<br />
    were relatively easy to read/understand but they were sold out and thus, I<br />
    didn&#8217;t make a purchase at all. We went to a China store (i.e. a store with<br />
    stuff from China not made out of China) and I think my mother bought a pair<br />
    of shoes there. Formal family pictures were taken at a studio far away. I<br />
    am not patient at those things, they are too picky and they take waay too<br />
    many pictures. By the time we got there, I was all sticky even though I just<br />
    took a shower before leaving the house. Dinner was at 9 p.m. (grrr so hungry<br />
    by then). Dry thunderstorm afterwards . . .and that was the interesting evening.
  </p>
<p>
    Day Nine: Wednesday, August 19, 1998 (Hong Kong Time Zone)<br />
    Yawn!!!!!!! We woke up early &#8212; but don&#8217;t ask me why we did that because I<br />
    had forgotten that the science museum didn&#8217;t open until 1:00 p.m. and the<br />
    art museum&#8211;who knows when that opened! Well, it&#8217;s kinda neat though because<br />
    on Wednesdays, both museums are free! It was our grandparents&#8217; 60th wedding<br />
    anniversary so after breakfast, we practiced our performance songs: Oh God<br />
    Loves You And Me and El Shaddai. Anyway that is to explain later. The art<br />
    museum was very interesting and uninteresting at the same time. I don&#8217;t understand<br />
    why they charge people money though, it&#8217;s not worth it and I wouldn&#8217;t go if<br />
    I had to pay. The funny thing is at the gift shop they sell CDs that are supposed<br />
    to be therapeutical such as a constipation-reliever. That is true! I am not<br />
    lying! </p>
<p>Went to the restaurant early to practice our songs. My sister sang like never<br />
    before and of course I was nothing in comparison (we both had solos for El<br />
    Shaddai). During the banquet, the kids had our own table and my grandfather<br />
    gave such a long speech in Chinese that I think everyone eventually got bored.<br />
    Because it was the last night before my cousins were to leave, they came over<br />
    and had a sleepover. </p>
<p>
    Day Ten: Wednesday, August 20, 1998 (Hong Kong Time Zone)<br />
    At 9 am we had to get up and &#8220;send&#8221; our cousins and their parents<br />
    off. We shopped and we went to a music studio cuz my father&#8217;s uncle or something,<br />
    wanted to give a violin to my brother because we were looking for one and<br />
    he happened to overhear and so he offered one as a gift. Had dim sum with<br />
    them and got to hear more interesting stories of his childhood. He is a very<br />
    good storyteller. Shopped some more. Wow, so what else is new? </p>
<p>That is all I have down on paper, I think we left the day after. The End.<br />
    Phew. <br />
    PS. Watched Titanic on the way back (on the plane) they had sensibly cut out<br />
    the inappropriate parts. 
  </p>
