								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				<![CDATA[That's our office cat in the photo. I'm one month in. And yet, it feels like a lot longer than that. I've found a rhythm that works with this new routine, and I'm thankful that both our kids have adjusted well too. Consequently, we transitioned our oldest to full day kindergarten, and after some trial and error, we dropped her afternoon nap, we eat dinner earlier, and they go to sleep earlier. Unfortunately, our youngest still wakes up at night and asks for food then, but our oldest seems to fall asleep faster and stays asleep throughout the night for the most part. This week has been one of the few germ-free weeks this year, so it's a nice relief to not have to deal with that (if it wasn't him, it was her, and if it wasn't either of them, it was us or our daycare) - I'm grateful that our workplaces are pretty flexible when it comes from work from home policies and taking time off / emergency days, so we pretty took turns staying home with one child or both children. How do working families who don't have backup plans / caregivers manage?
At the beginning, it sort of felt like I was starting at a new school in the middle of the school year; I had a lot to learn and a lot of faces and names to remember. I still have a lot to learn and faces and names to remember, but it feels like I'm making an impact. I'm also thankful that I enjoy my work, so it's easy to wake up earlier and rush out the door.
We will have to find a different routine come summer, but so far, it's been working out just perfectly. I'm glad I scaled back my hours (before signing the offer) because it turns out if you're driving a car for school pick-up, you pretty much have to arrive in the neighbourhood at least 20 minutes early in order to find available street parking around the perimeter of the school; otherwise, you're pretty much out of luck. And even though I get off at 2:30PM, by the time I get everyone home, it's 4PM. I then give them a small snack, work on unloading the dishwasher and getting another load in, and starting supper. By the time we are done dinner, it's close to 7PM, and we play a bit then bathe (if applicable), and then off to bed. After that, I clean up the kitchen (pack food away, prep lunches) and maybe wash or fold the laundry. I've been doing laundry on weekends in loads, so I can just sit and binge-watch Netflix (working through The Crown) while folding.
Surprisingly, I find myself dozing off before midnight and using the computer less after work (but still on my phone) - maybe it's because I no longer have mid-day naps or work is more tiring than staying at home (though I feel it's a break / nice change from home life). I'm on a modified work week, and I'm already wondering how full-time working parents do this every day and survive? I applaud those families!
Other than work and school, we started going to a different small group / life group, which has changed to an earlier start time, which means for the first time in a long time, we actually get to stay past dinner. We have also started going to another church, primarily because Bean is at an age where she is learning, and I simply can't go on teaching her every week - and when I don't, I hear implied comments about going to a different church anyway. I'm a little sad, but since I also miss fellowship time because I'm watching them after service is over while everyone else is chatting and because people don't tend to eat together for lunch as much anymore, I'm not really connecting with anyone either. I know Bean misses it because on occasion, she tells me she wants to go back to Simply, or that she wants me to be her teacher that day, and every time we pass by St. Paul's, she points out that it's our church. Finding a new church to call home is hard. Personally, I don't like the format of the sermons by the lead pastor at this new church so far (grossly paraphrased: partial verses are taken from different translations to fit into the sermon's points) though the supporting pastor actually goes into a passage in contrast, but the kids seem to have adjusted so well even at the first visit and a lot of effort is put into the children's spiritual wellbeing and education. So yes, 2018 is going to be a year of change and adjustment.


<hr />
Two years ago, we were celebrating <a href="http://her.happyhippos.ca/2016/02/two-month-milestones/">two month milestones</a>. Now, at 2, he&#8217;s come a long way:


<ul>
    

<li>Speaks in complete sentences. Has started to communicate (and copy) in English. Boo.</li>


    

<li>Enjoys climbing and doing crazy things and will deliberately test boundaries with people in authority (me &#8211; he&#8217;s heavy so I can&#8217;t just pick him up and grab him while grocery shopping for example, so I don&#8217;t go when I&#8217;m on my own as it&#8217;s impossible to get more than one or two things in one trip)</li>


    

<li>Loves to sing, and can sing many songs in English including the Alphabet song, Twinkle Twinkle Little Star, Away in the Manger, Roly Poly and can sing along with or recognize songs by Walk Off the Earth, Moana, and Frozen.</li>


    

<li>Loves trains, especially Thomas. And cars. And airplanes. Prefers trains though, if given a choice.</li>


    

<li>Easily sucked in by technology: photos on the phone, TV, iPad game, and YouTube videos. One time early on, the caregiver gave an older child a tablet to use while the younger ones were supposed to nap; he had a meltdown and refused to sleep. Then she figured out why (we had warned her prior so she made the connection and no more problems since).</li>


    

<li>Has not completely weaned. So, I&#8217;m still off dairy and some nuts. Nuts!</li>


    

<li>While he started off with liking meat, he doesn&#8217;t seem to like meat (fish the exception) as much anymore, unless it&#8217;s chicken nuggets/fingers/crispy. He will still eat it but when it is in chunks, he tends to pick it out. He also doesn&#8217;t like green fiber veggies, but will repeatedly down it in smoothie form. Like his sister, he loves fruit. Avocados, bananas, and cereal with alternative milk are now his favourite breakfast foods. He is a soup and rice monster. Sometimes noodles too.</li>


    

<li>Self-toilet training is hit and miss so far &#8211; and if successful, it&#8217;s still only #2 (though a few times, he wakes up with a dry diaper and will go if you put him on the toilet); progress seems to have slowed down or regressed especially now that he doesn&#8217;t tell his caregiver he needs to go (or maybe she hasn&#8217;t learned the signs yet)</li>


    

<li>He may have had a mini <a href="http://her.happyhippos.ca/2017/04/the-day-we-had-our-first-ambulance-ride/">febrile seizure</a> the other week, when he had a slight fever (while fighting off strange rashes &#8211; maybe mild symptoms of hand, foot, mouth + reaction to lactose in Tylenol) but it lasted no more than a few seconds and it was in his sleep.</li>


    

<li>He seems interested in people he knows (and babies) &#8211; often willing to share a toy, asking for someone by name, offering hugs to those he loves (except it&#8217;s sad to see hugs not reciprocated, especially when his sister comes out from dance class and he goes to hug her and she brushes him off; however, she always asks to go into timeout with him when he&#8217;s in trouble), and enjoys helping out in the kitchen (putting dishes away, watching and helping mommy cook/bake)</li>


    

<li>He must have shorter legs or something, because he fits his age in tops when it comes to sizing but his bottoms are behind a bit.</li>


</ul>


I&#8217;m amazed at how fast our children is growing up, now that we all have slightly different routines and that they are no longer babies.]]&gt;		</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				<![CDATA[It's the time of the year again: it's back to school season, and with only a few days remaining of summer, I'm starting to feel a bit anxious about school - and I'm not even the one that's starting school!


<h3>Homeschooling</h3>


I have been reflecting a bit about school for the past few months &#8211; in fact, this post started as a post about homeschooling back in May, as more and more families we knew were homeschooling or planning to homeschool. I briefly considered it, and even paid to check out the <a href="http://www.kwchea.ca/conference.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">KWCHEA</a>&#8216;s homeschool conference exhibit hall to look at resources and get a better sense of what is available for a homeschooling family.  While buying into curriculum and paying for supplementary classes to supplement a child&#8217;s education / learning can be costly (vs. free public school education), I found that there were plenty of free resources (and you could develop your own curriculum as a result) and quite a bit of local support (e.g. free gym time for homeschooled children, email lists) so that you could still have social interaction with other peers. I also found that there were a few memberships that were free to join if your oldest child is under 6 years old,  which gives you access to a support network and perks like (significant) discounts to places like Great Wolf Lodge. But, what a vendor said got to me &#8211; partly because my first feeling was &#8220;no, it&#8217;s not!&#8221; but then I know that there is some truth to what he said: he basically told me that home education was God&#8217;s calling for all Christian families because the responsibility lies with the parents to teach their children and because that was how it was done historically/biblically (ie. why leave it to other people to do that). I thought about the examples in the Bible, and how children learned their father&#8217;s trade as an apprentice (yes, that supports what he&#8217;s saying), but then didn&#8217;t the young men go off to the synagogue to learn scripture from the pharisees / teacher of the law? And if it&#8217;s God&#8217;s calling for every Christian family to homeschool their children, that must mean that most are ignoring His calling &#8211; is that possible and true? With homeschooling, I know I don&#8217;t have to be as worried about the impacts of early sex education, or the in-your-face celebration of gender rights and gay pride, but I don&#8217;t want to shelter my kids either.
At first, I didn&#8217;t want to consider homeschooling my children because my first exposure to a homeschooler wasn&#8217;t a very positive experience, when a student who had attended a public elementary school, then moved to being homeschooled (maybe due to her being teased for being a Jehovah&#8217;s Witness?), and then in high school tried to transition back, but she didn&#8217;t last very long and was pulled out. So, I&#8217;m biased to think that the transition from home education to public might be really difficult and not successful.


<h3>Public education</h3>


Among the selfish reasons why I didn&#8217;t want to homeschool is that I didn&#8217;t want to deal with the social isolation, or forcing myself and the children to interact with other homeschooled families &#8211; or trying to find ways to be socially involved, be it signing up for supplementary classes ($) or leading co-op-like initiatives. Then again, while I excelled and really enjoyed the academic parts of school, I don&#8217;t think I really felt like I truly fit in socially (oh, the insecure me, but perhaps it&#8217;s reflective of what the Bible says about being in this world, but not of it, or <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-11.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">being foreigners</a>[ref]&#8221;If you were of the world, the world would love you as its own; but because you are not of the world, but I chose you out of the world, therefore the world hates you.&#8221; Matthew 5:19 ESV[/ref]). Maybe it was due to a combination of language struggles, cultural differences, and a Christian upbringing; I&#8217;m not really sure.[ref]Case in point, 6-year-old-me awkwardly learned that just because the teacher is Chinese, it doesn&#8217;t mean that a) she speaks Chinese and b) that she can read my name in Chinese, when the worksheet says &#8220;Name:&#8221; on it. Likewise, just because she is Chinese, it also doesn&#8217;t mean she knows what <span id="result_box" class="short_text" lang="zh-TW"><span class="">白花油 is and its medicinal purposes &#8211; and will tell you to take it off because it smells -_- (embarrassed of my mom moments) . Though, </span></span>I was super happy to find a Chinese student (Canadian-Chinese) who appreciated my baked BBQ pork bun lunches.[/ref]
One downside of following the crowd, kids these days are entering the education system as early as 3 years old, and at full days &#8211; without naps &#8211; too! Great for paying parents as they can save on childcare expenses, but for those young ones who have meltdowns because of missed naps, personally I think it&#8217;s too much, too soon (probably because my generation started as young as 4 years old only at half days). Actually, it&#8217;s nice that kindergarten is optional for families here, but if I hold them back, I feel that they would miss out on key social interaction development and other learning milestones and will lag far behind when starting Grade 1, especially if one throws in French immersion into the mix.
I pray that her social experiences be better than mine, especially as she navigates the first few years of school! And I pray as a parent, that we&#8217;ll be responsible for keeping on top of what is being taught so that we can supplement with truth and a biblical worldview when necessary.


<h3>Change</h3>


As we transition into a new chapter of our lives (including new morning routines and making school-friendly lunches), I&#8217;m comforted that even though I was a bit disappointed to learn that there are 6 kindergarten classes in her school and none of her friends (or the other couple of kids we know) are in the same class, she is really excited and looking forward to starting school (much more so than when I teach her in Sunday School). After going through the <a href="https://www.strongstart.ca/programs/get-ready-for-school/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Get Ready for School</a> program, she has loved programs and have done so well in them.  When people ask me if we&#8217;re ready, this blogger mom sums up my feelings quite well: <a href="http://blog.mops.org/paving-the-runway/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">&#8220;She was so ready – that made one of us.  I’m not sure if I’m finally relieved to have some time to myself [or more time with the youngest, rather] or if I’m just terribly sad&#8221;.</a>  I know little brother will miss her dearly too, and I&#8217;m sure I won&#8217;t know what to do with just him at the beginning but here&#8217;s to change, God willing!]]&gt;		</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				<![CDATA[If you had suggested me to take two kids on a plane, by myself, I would have looked at you as if you were crazy, though I still might. But here I am, back from a trip to Vancouver and lived to tell that not only did we all survive, no crying tears were shed on the plane - and those of you who know our littlest, you probably remember that when he is left by himself for any period especially in an unfamiliar environment with unfamiliar faces, he starts to wail in no time, <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew+19%3A26&amp;version=ESV" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">but with God, <em><strong>all</strong></em> things are possible</a>!


<h3>Last minute trip</h3>


A few weeks ago, j.w found out that his company was sending him to Vegas. The initial plan was that we leave Bean with the grandparents for a few days while taking the baby with us. Except Vegas was 45C, feeling like 50C outside, and it isn&#8217;t exactly the most baby-friendly place. Plus, <a href="http://her.happyhippos.ca/2009/01/vegas/">I&#8217;ve been to Vegas before</a> and decided that being there once was enough.  So that left me with the option of staying home with the kids, in Toronto with the kids, or&#8230;I could pay an extra ticket and take all the kids with me to visit family in Vancouver; after all, Bean has been asking about when she could visit her cousin for months now &#8211; plus, I could help with kid-sitting since my mom&#8217;s sprained ankle wasn&#8217;t much better so she couldn&#8217;t take my sister&#8217;s kids. Turns out, my brother-in-law&#8217;s brother (does that make him brother-in-law too?) &#8211; who has no kids &#8211; was really awesome with the kids; they all loved him, and by the end of it, my crying boy loved him and Bean even chose him to drop us off at the airport &#8211;  over her aunt and grandma!  I could even leave him with 4 kids while I did dishes &#8211; made me think that maybe that&#8217;s what having an au pair feels like. We both concluded that <strong>two adults watching four kids is so much easier </strong>than one adult watching two, especially with the girls and boys being so close in age &#8211; the girls often went off giggling and up to no good, while the boys were okay in each others&#8217; company, even though they didn&#8217;t really play together much &#8211; other than around the train set. We also talked about how having more children at a home daycare is better because of this and you get paid more. Sleep was probably the biggest challenge, with him waking up at 5-6am the first few mornings, and having them sleep in on the two days that count: for church and the day of departure. Thankfully, with the two girls sleeping in one room, I didn&#8217;t really have to be with her although I felt bad that I often neglected her to try to put the youngest to sleep. My admiration for single parents have increased tenfold, especially if they don&#8217;t have any other family support around them to deal with sleep time, meals, meltdowns, and accidents. Trips out west generally feel really short even if it is longer than two weeks, but it seemed that 10 days was good enough this time &#8211; despite missed connections with old friends (we tried!); by the end, I felt I needed another vacation after this one.


<h3>On the plane</h3>


Speaking of departure, there&#8217;s nothing like hearing your name on the intercom at the airport along after the generic &#8220;final boarding call for flight xxxx  to Abbotsford; paging passengers L and W&#8221; that gets your legs going &#8211; while towing a preschooler in the car seat that&#8217;s strapped around the carry-on suitcase [ref]thanks to an idea from the internet &#8211; I saved $30 and used a non-weight tested luggage strap, carabiner and keychain ring, and the car seat tether instead &#8211; probably would be safer if I had used a weight-tested carabiner and O-ring instead [/ref] and carrying the baby in the ergo &#8211; and feeling sweaty by the time you settle into your seat on the plane. Thankfully, we were at the end of the second moving sidewalk already when I heard my name so it wasn&#8217;t too far for me to sprint there and wave, &#8220;we&#8217;re here &#8211; wait for me!&#8221;.
I don&#8217;t know what happened to the time, but we left church late, met with some traffic on the road, and of course, everything just takes longer with kids; thankfully, I had no luggage to check-in (another great thing about having cousins close in age and size). But by the time we were through the family line in security, I looked at one of the screens and noticed that there was only 15 mins left until departure so instead of taking the friendly security officer&#8217;s advice to wait for a golf cart (I did go there to see if a cart was around). Actually, everyone was super kind at security and on my flight &#8211; they let me take the baby through in the ergo and didn&#8217;t even scan it, and perhaps I was last on board, but they offered to take my (heavy 25lb+) suitcase and ended up stowing it overhead up front (I told them I didn&#8217;t need anything in it, so I would also be okay if they decided to check it) and carrying my car seat into our row, while I took care of the kids and the backpack. As we were settling into our row, one of the flight attendants strongly suggested to the passenger in our row to move to another row &#8211; back 10 rows! She politely declined, saying that she was fine, but with some prompting from the flight attendant saying that it would give us some wiggle room and that she wouldn&#8217;t be sitting beside anyone, she finally agreed, and I thanked her with relief. Had I known that there were empty rows, I would&#8217;ve volunteered to go back, but I had asked if it was a full flight, and the answer I got was that there were only a few seats here and there. So we got a whole row to ourselves, with was great, as it allowed the kids to spread out and take turns in the car seat and the other seat.

Unfortunately, Bean didn&#8217;t sleep at all (thus missing her nap) and little brother only got in a 30 minute nap at most both on the flight there and back. I do celebrate mini-successes though: on the first flight, I  did manage to transfer him into the car seat so that I could take her to the washroom. The second time she had to go, I picked a child-friendly show I had previously downloaded from Netflix on the iPad and gave him some snacks to munch on; alas, when I had to go the third time, he didn&#8217;t like it, so I took him with me. On the way back, he didn&#8217;t complain at all! Snacks (apple chips, <a href="https://broghies.com/whats-a-broghie/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">puffed rice crackers</a>, and baby food pouches, and the plane&#8217;s apple juice diluted with water) and new toys / activities (stickers, coloring, mini puzzles) kept them sane, but what worked on the 5 hr flight there didn&#8217;t work for the flight back &#8211; I only needed to take out 3 activities (1 for the boy) and the snacks for the short 3.5 hr flight back (wow, that&#8217;s some tail wind!), perhaps because the Dreamliner had the in-flight entertainment console (minus the sound &#8211; didn&#8217;t bother with earbuds), and the really cool shade button that adjusts the brightness and darkness of the passenger window pane. While we only got two seats to share among the three of us, it seemed more spacious than the Air Canada Rouge plane to Abbotsford &#8211; roomy enough for the boy to nap on my lap (again, for less than 30 minutes because he woke up upon transfer when Bean needed to use the lavatories) and for him to stand and sit on the floor in front of my seat.

<h3>Highlights</h3>


This trip felt very different because it was more about spending time with my sister&#8217;s family than seeing friends, trying new places, or going out. We did go out &#8211; often fitting the kids in 4 car seats in my sister&#8217;s Rondo + 2 adults in front, but it was to do kid-friendly activities, which were:

<script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script><strong>A visit to Ikea</strong> for play and lunch: this happens regularly in my sister&#8217;s family, but Bean was finally tall enough to play in the ball room so it was her first time; we took the boys to the unsupervised kids area in the showroom to play. At lunch, one of the staff pointed out the computer that was near the cash that lists all the ingredients in their food &#8211; the fish and chips were not safe (contains dairy), but the chicken fingers were safe so I got a kids meal instead with fries.</li>


    

<li><a href="http://www.coquitlam.ca/parks-recreation-and-culture/sport-and-recreation/dropins.aspx#Aquatics" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>$1 swim</strong> at the local community centre</a>: on Tuesdays and Thursdays, it&#8217;s only $1 a person, and the warm pool and communal change room is very large (with private changing stalls and showers in the latter) and you have a lot of accessories to use like life-jackets, floating boards, toys, and duck boats, plus you only need a quarter to lock up your stuff in the lockers AND you get your money back when you open it again. Don&#8217;t bring a water camera into the pool though, they don&#8217;t allow it. The littlest in our group ended up falling asleep on a duck boat when my sister took the two girls to shower.</li>


    

<li><strong>A meal at Red Robin</strong> meant you had unlimited sides &#8211; and they make the birthday girl stand up in her (high) chair when they sing their birthday song. I like independent restaurants but I have discovered that chain restaurants, like Red Robin, tend to be much better at providing ingredients / allergen information for each menu item. By the way, if you have the app, if you end up earning the 10th burger free on your visit, it will automatically trump any other promotion you may be offered, including 20% off your bill. Each kid also gets to take a balloon home where it is played with for days after.</li>

<script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script><strong>A day trip to ride the</strong> <strong>bus, Skytrain and Seabus</strong>: this in particular brings up memories of my aunt taking me to do this as a child; we didn&#8217;t use public transportation as a means to go somewhere, we just used it for the ride. The kids seemed to enjoy it as much as I did way back when. This time, I got to see and use the (finally done) Compass system for the first time, and going on a Saturday meant that everything was one-zone fare &#8211; and we managed to make all our connections before the time was up each way! There&#8217;s a small but free twirly slide into a pit of balls at Lonsdale Quay, but I forgot socks for my kids, so I took them to see the coin rides instead. I didn&#8217;t have money, but the $1 double decker London bus ride would&#8217;ve been the best value as it could&#8217;ve easily fit 4 kids in it &#8211; plus there&#8217;s a TV screen inside that acts like a window. Splurged on some local peaches and <a href="http://www.coconama.com/learn/nutrition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">coconama chocolate</a> because they had some nut and dairy-free versions (I&#8217;ve sampled some before but I can&#8217;t remember where &#8211; perhaps at the Handmade Show at the PNE). We were treated to some live music by a very talented young boy while we had our lunch, and I was surprised that my son ate an entire dynamite roll for lunch.</li>

<script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script><strong>A visit to Science World</strong>: they have added a relatively enclosed section [ref]with a staff member at the entrance monitoring who goes in/comes out &#8211; hoping to keep stray kids inside I think[/ref] dedicated for 0-5 year olds, which was amazing; they could have easily spent their entire day in this gallery &#8211; it had a climbing structure (no slide, but I&#8217;d recommend bringing socks), sensory play areas like water features, giant lite brite panel, kaleidoscope, balls, foam building blocks and plastic pipes, and a scoop-and-dump oatmeal-like area. The girls didn&#8217;t care for most of the shows, but we all enjoyed the bubble show on the main stage. The best part is that my sister found a <a href="https://www.scienceworld.ca/chinese-coupon-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2-for-1 admission promotion</a> posted on their site for those that can read Chinese. Odd, but we used it!</li>

<script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script><strong>Blueberry picking</strong>: I&#8217;ve picked strawberries, raspberries, and blackberries but I don&#8217;t recall picking blueberries before &#8211; they just fall off the tree in clusters when you give it a tug! Thankfully the kids didn&#8217;t really notice the long detour and traffic until closer to the end of our drive.</li>

Bought some <a href="http://jerkstore.ca/products/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">locally made beef jerky</a> at the pop-up market as it&#8217;s the first time I&#8217;ve seen jerky without any garlic or onions!</li>

On the other days, the kids were happy to play in the yard with bubble guns and on the make-shift slide that their uncle made; the water table made its first appearance outside, and was actually filled with water (that I had forgotten was gifted to Bean when she was born &#8211; but was then re-gifted because there was no way would we lug a table back). So thankful that the weather was really good during the time we were there &#8211; not too wet and neither too hot nor too cold!  Now, I&#8217;m looking forward to when my sister and her two come to us in September &#8211; she decided to brave the flights too! I am hoping it will still be warm enough to try water beads with them and sidewalk chalk fun then, and maybe even the mini parachute from Amazon Prime Day.]]&gt;		</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				<![CDATA[Today marks the end of steamed milk in my coffee, grilled cheese sandwiches, peanut butter pretzels and buttered popcorn, yogurt, ice cream, and other products containing milk, possibly soy, and peanuts in my diet until the end of our breastfeeding days, which&nbsp;might be for another year or more. While I only have to endure it until the end of our breastfeeding time together, our little one might have to watch his diet for the rest of his life - I'm sad for him, but at least he won't have memories of enjoying those, so he may have less cravings for them, and hopefully better self-control (than I do!)[ref]I didn't realize how much I regularly enjoy milk products until now, even though I don't care for milk itself[/ref].&nbsp;
I once suspected that milk might have been the culprit in his&nbsp;bouts of eczema and bloody stools[ref]though the latter might still be as a result of constipation[/ref], when he was known to spit up after every feeding (I would say mild reflux), and experienced three vomiting episodes after eating one serving of rice cereal that contained milk ingredients, but I was in denial; how could it be? My daily diet only consisted of milk in my one cup of espresso - or so I thought; I forgot about the cheese, ice cream, butter, everything else that has milk protein in it. I'm pretty sure I was in denial, so I didn't&nbsp;cut anything in my diet, thinking that it wasn't really an allergy, and like his sister, would outgrow it. Now, after a visit to an allergist and a positive prick/rash/allergy test, it's official: he&nbsp;has a milk and peanut&nbsp;allergy.
So now, our low-maintenance baby has become a high-maintenance one; I guess our "easy" baby was too good to be true. Yet, this news comes at a timely moment in our lives; we're reading through&nbsp;<em>The Power of a Praying Parent</em> by Stormie Omartian (I keep thinking it&#8217;s &#8220;O&#8217;Martian&#8221;), and we just covered a chapter that talks about releasing our children to God, and this is an example of a very much an appropriate moment to follow her model of prayer: that if it&#8217;s in His will and in His time, that our son will outgrow both his allergies; but&nbsp;if not, will be managed well so that no one would ever need to use an epipen on him; but if so, that it is administered successfully and effectively.
I&#8217;m still processing the news, so I didn&#8217;t get a chance to think of and ask the many follow-up questions that have since popped up (stemming from online research and what others have shared with me &#8211; yep, I&#8217;m also one of those internet moms), but here are some questions that people have asked and the answers I have come across:
<strong>Q. Will he outgrow his&nbsp;allergy?
A.&nbsp;</strong><a href="http://aacijournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1710-1492-7-S1-S7#Sec12" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Possibly</a>. Our allergist says that many children outgrow their milk allergy by the age of 5. I just found out&nbsp;that my siblings and I all had milk allergies until we were 1 years old, and our mother experimented by trying to reintroduce milk slowly and over time. However, only 20% of kids outgrow their peanut allergy. Because Bean seemed to have a milder reaction to peanut butter when she was younger, but outgrew it by 2 years old &#8211; which surprised him, the allergist suggested paying for a blood test to see if her brother&nbsp;would qualify for reintroduction of peanuts under clinical supervision; we&#8217;re praying that&nbsp;he&#8217;d be eligible. So, as of now, it is what it is &#8211; will just have to adapt to manage it.
<strong>Q. How severe is his allergy?
A.</strong> At the skin prick test, the one for peanuts was about 5mm, and the one for milk was slightly larger (6mm, maybe?); I think&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15482519" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the size indicates a positive diagnosi</a>s,&nbsp;but I didn&#8217;t think to ask. According to one site,&nbsp;&#8220;<a href="http://www.kidswithfoodallergies.org/page/food-allergy-test-diagnosis-skin-prick-blood.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">no test [&#8230;] can determine severity</a>&#8220;. Nevertheless,&nbsp;we&#8217;ve been advised to keep two epipens with him. While, I don&#8217;t know the criteria for what makes an allergy a risk for anaphylaxis, we have&nbsp;seen <a href="http://aacijournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1710-1492-7-S1-S6#Sec4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">symptoms matching the criteria in Table 3, section 2 (GI and skin symptoms)</a>&nbsp;and <a href="http://aacijournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1710-1492-7-S1-S6#Sec3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">in this table</a>.
The allergist&nbsp;prescribed two injectors (<a href="http://www.kidswithfoodallergies.org/page/newly-diagnosed.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">as does this site</a>), but I think&nbsp;most people I know only carry one. Although he does not meet <a href="http://aacijournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1710-1492-10-40" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the minimum recommended weight of 15 KG (33 LBs)</a>, the allergist still recommended that over a self-administered antidote citing that human / user error is very common. He then used an ultrasound machine to measure the thickness of muscle between the skin and the bone, to make sure that our son&#8217;s thighs is fat enough &#8211; more than 13mm &#8211; <a href="http://aacijournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1710-1492-10-40#Sec2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">so that the injection won&#8217;t hit bone</a> (and bone marrow, which is equivalent to a IV administration and that&#8217;s bad); he was 16mm. Another option is available (TwinJet?) but is supposedly the same dose.
<strong>Q. Is there no other option other than Epipen? What about Benadryl?</strong>
<strong>A. </strong>The allergist and online sources tells me that&nbsp;Benadryl won&#8217;t help with breathing, but it may help reduce other symptoms (e.g. puffy eyes, lips).
<strong>Q. What can he drink instead of milk, to get the fat content and other nutrients that is in whole milk?
A.&nbsp;</strong>My dietician and online sources say that breastmilk is best so to keep breastfeeding for as long as possible. As long as we have the go ahead to eat soy, we can also have soy and coconut milk; there&#8217;s rice and almond milk as well. I&#8217;ve tried hemp milk, and it tastes like grassy straw, which I&#8217;m not a fan of at all. Fortified alternatives provide at least 30% calcium and some fat content, but it doesn&#8217;t completely replace milk&#8217;s benefits; it&#8217;s also a shame that many companies use carrageenan (or xanthan gum, but not as bad) to thicken their drink, and add sea salt to flavour it. I have to remember to continue to supplement him with Vitamin D. For good fat, I will likely have to be more creative, using oils like avocado or olive, and serving more salmon (frozen filet steaks of wild Alaskan salmon is readily available from Kirkland / Costco year-round, works out to be 10$/lb which is reasonable)
<strong>Q. What about formula?
A.&nbsp;</strong>Online sources seem to suggest that if a baby has a milk allergy, baby may have a higher likelihood of developing a soy allergy, so switching to a soy based formula may end up increasing the risk.
<strong>Q. Can he have lactose-free, cheese, or yogurt? What about goat&#8217;s or sheep&#8217;s milk?
A.&nbsp;</strong>Unfortunately, the allergy is to the milk protein, not the lactose. Most people with milk allergy is to cow&#8217;s milk protein, but I&#8217;m not sure if we have the go-ahead to try other kinds of dairy.
I did mention that I had accidentally fed him vegetables cooked in butter a couple of times and failed to see a reaction, to which he was surprised, so as a result, he told me keep to doing it, but don&#8217;t go beyond what I normally would have done. We will likely have to monitor him very, very closely if we do that &#8211; not to mention, we&#8217;ll have to watch&nbsp;him even more closely when we aren&#8217;t the ones providing his meal / food. Though, I wonder if he&nbsp;can tolerate <a href="https://aacijournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1710-1492-8-5#Sec1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">extreme heated milk products</a>&nbsp;&#8211; will have to ask.
<strong>Q. Can he have other nuts?</strong>
A. In theory, yes. Peanuts is technically a legume and not a tree nut (e.g walnut, pecan), but we have to be careful of cross contamination because they may be processed in facility that isn&#8217;t peanut free.
<strong>Q. What about peanut oil?</strong>
<strong>A.</strong> I&#8217;m not sure about this one. Online sources say that pure unrefined peanut oil should be safe, but I need to check with the allergist about this one. Will likely have to avoid though,&nbsp;especially in commercial places, like restaurants &#8211; because can you be sure that it&#8217;s pure and unrefined?
<strong>Q. So, are you a peanut and dairy-free household now?</strong>
<strong>A.</strong> Thankfully, complete elimination measures aren&#8217;t necessary at this time. In fact, the allergist told us specifically not to stop giving our daughter peanut butter! However,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.hamiltonhealthsciences.ca/documents/Patient%20Education/CowMilkProteinAllergyWhatToEatBreastfeeding-trh.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mom will also need to follow a similar elimination diet</a>, which will be a challenge, as she can&#8217;t eat anything from the allium family either (e.g garlic, onions, chives, leeks).
<strong>Q.</strong> <strong>What can I do to help?</strong>
<strong>A.</strong> Pray for us &#8211; I (we) have no idea what I&#8217;m (we&#8217;re) doing. Trying to avoid garlic, onions, etc. is already hard; I&#8217;m also thinking that avoiding dairy will likely be more challenging than peanuts. And, if you eat with us, we especially appreciate that you take our dietary needs into consideration &#8211; understandably, it&#8217;s probably&nbsp;especially hard if you&nbsp;don&#8217;t need to conscientious of it in your everyday life; I&#8217;m sorry for the inconvenience. If you&#8217;re in a similar family situation, I&#8217;m open to hearing advice and your experiences too. Thank you!]]&gt;		</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				<![CDATA[I often look forward to Saturdays because there is still one more day left before the work week begins again. If I don't have a chance to sleep in, and j.w doesn't take the kids (or leaves me one while he plays MTG), it means that we can spend time together as a family -&nbsp;this usually means we do our weekly shopping trip at Costco or&nbsp;the Kitchener Market.
A couple Saturdays ago, it was certainly a nice kind of different:&nbsp;we took part of a little library&nbsp;community build and we visited the region's waste management site. &nbsp;


<h3>Little Library &#8211; Community Build</h3>

At the start of the year,&nbsp;I had shared with j.w two of my <del>resolutions</del>[ref]I don&#8217;t believe in resolutions as I don&#8217;t (like to) make promises I can&#8217;t keep[/ref] goals for the year, which he has helped me to meet: make our bed daily (a little step towards to tidiness) and get a little library up and running in our front yard (community).
A community build event took place and j.w put together most of the little library house. To our surprise, we now share another thing in common with our neighbours two houses down: not only do our sons share the same first name, but they also have the same gable-style library that they picked up the same morning!
Sometime this summer, I aim to paint/stain it, seal it, and then put it up with some family-friendly reading, primarily books in the Christian and children genre. While there are plenty of other little libraries with children&#8217;s literature, I wonder what the uptake will be on Christian books. I have other little ideas for it, including maybe a Facebook group to post what&#8217;s available, a NFC check-in tag, as well a QR tag to track the location and review of the books that go through our little library &#8211; those are lofty ideas, so we shall see.


<h3>Waterloo Region Waste Management &#8211; Open House</h3>

After a morning of building most of the little library, we rushed to the waste management site. I had signed us up to go because of Bean&#8217;s interest in garbage trucks and buses &#8211; a school bus was to take us on a tour of the site, with pauses at the current landfill, and a stop at the recycling centre. If their goal of open houses is to send an environmental message home, I think it achieved it with our family; it probably ended up being the most educational for us, the parents. Here&#8217;s what I learned:


<ul>
    

<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_box_recycling_system#History" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The (now world-wide) blue box recycling program started in Kitchener</a></li>


    

<li>The waste management site &#8220;hires&#8221; two <a href="http://www.therecord.com/news-story/4260095-this-job-is-for-the-birds/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hawks to send seagulls away</a> a few times a week</li>


    

<li>Mount Trashmore, our local popular tobogganing hill, was discontinued as a landfill in the &#8217;70s</li>


    

<li>Landfills that are at max capacity are capped with ceramic before being topped with soil and grass</li>


    

<li>Items you throw in the garbage that you know are biodegradable or claims to biodegrade in X days won&#8217;t actually ever if it ends up in the landfill because the environment isn&#8217;t right for it; it actually gets packed down (sort of WALL-E-like), so it lacks oxygen and organisms that break it down</li>


    

<li>A tarp-like sheet goes over every layer of garbage to keep it from blowing away and fumes and moisture are sent through pipes, where the methane gas is collected and converted into energy; I didn&#8217;t see any burning pipes anywhere, nor did it smell nearly as bad as the one we used to drive back next to Highway 1 back home before it got converted to a driving range</li>


</ul>


You could say that we unknowingly took part in some Earth Day weekend activities, with a specific focus on recycling / reusing (books in the community instead of the garbage, and learning about recycling operations in our city). It felt like a long day, but it wasn&#8217;t even mid-afternoon yet by the time we finished! While I do enjoy doing our regular stops, after this past Saturday&#8217;s activities together as a family, I find it&#8217;s worth waking up early if it means doing something different.
Some neat upcoming events in May around #kwawesome that you could do with your family, a date, or friends are:


<ul>
    

<li>Saturday, May 7, 9-10:30a <a href="http://janeswalk.org/canada/kitchener/lets-have-coffee-or-10/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Coffee walk around Downtown Kitchener (DTK)</a></li>


    

<li>Sunday, May 8, 2p <a href="http://janeswalk.org/canada/kitchener/spur-line-trail-smile-tiger-berlin-bicycle-cafe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Coffee tour bike-ride on Spur Line Trail</a></li>


    

<li>Friday, May 27, 6-7p Listening choir DTK (probably not suitable for families with little ones, as they will likely get impatient or lose attention since there&#8217;s no speaking and you stand and appreciate the urban noise) &#8211; other dates are also available</li>


</ul>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				<![CDATA[For two weeks, we had the company of my family with us (minus two). I especially treasured moments between our two-year old and her cousin, who at six months younger, seemed to equal in height and just a bit more solid in terms of weight.
While it seemed like they took some time to get used to the presence of each other, by the end of the visit, they played and interacted with each other without needing any encouragement from us. I now know that Bean is capable of independent play (the adults spent a whole meal eating around the dining table while the two played in the play area)! This visit seemed like they were closer than their time spent in California together, even though that was only a few months prior.
I worried that Bean was going to have some withdrawal, but she seems to be coping it quite well; Mommy might be the one that ends up in withdrawal as she settles us back into a quieter routine that will likely be marked with hibernation tendencies due to the cooler weather.
The two weeks seemed to go by quickly, as each day was packed with an activity, with only one or two days of resting at home. I discovered that it's more fun and motivating to do things with others - and that there is a lot of low to no-cost activities offered here in region! Each day required some flexibility, as we often didn't leave the house until past 10:30 or 11am, but nap times were generally around 2:30pm - sometimes&nbsp;in the car.&nbsp;


<h3>Our&nbsp;stay-cation</h3>


Niagara area


<ul>
    

<li><strong>Cousin&#8217;s wedding at Creekside Estate Winery</strong>:&nbsp;a&nbsp;lovely&nbsp;intimate evening outdoor wedding,&nbsp;with traditions brought&nbsp;in from the bride and groom&#8217;s culture &#8211; Metis and Chinese (including&nbsp;a&nbsp;tying ceremony and mooncakes). However, I couldn&#8217;t bring myself to try the cheese and crackers&nbsp;that&nbsp;many of the fruit flies feasted on &#8211;&nbsp;they can&#8217;t&nbsp;be avoided at this time of the year because of the grapes they say); we managed to catch the super moon / lunar eclipse!</li>


    

<li><strong><a href="http://outletcollectionatniagara.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Outlet Collection at Niagara</a></strong>&nbsp;&#8211; I found it to be more spacious with better food selection / food courts&nbsp;than Premium Outlets &#8211; though we managed to squeeze in a 30-minute power shopping stop&nbsp;at those outlets too in Milton on the way to the airport</li>


    

<li><strong>August 8</strong>: The Golden&nbsp;Lotus buffet at Fallsview charges a ridiculous $16 for a 2-year old (same until 10 years old) even though the adults are $20. <em>How many two year olds can eat the same amount as a ten-year old, or 4/5ths of an adult?&nbsp;</em>I enjoyed the variety and quality of the kitchen (cooked) options. They charge a more reasonable $1.20 per year of the child (free under 2). As it turns out mind you, August 8 pricing is&nbsp;actually more per person than Fallsview (because Lotus includes tax and it&#8217;s lower per adult), so&nbsp;had we gone,&nbsp;Golden Lotus would&#8217;ve saved us at least $16 in the end despite the $16 meal for the 2-year old. Ah well, at least we can say we tried August&nbsp;8 now.&nbsp;</li>


</ul>




<div>In town</div>




<ul>
    

<li><strong>Early Years Centre:</strong> Music &amp; Movement scheduled program meant that they participated in some songs and parachute fun. It was C&#8217;s first time, but she wasn&#8217;t shy about it the second time we went; they also had the opportunity to play on the Little Tikes plastic playground&nbsp;items in the open gym&nbsp;and little odds and ends in the Orange Room</li>


    

<li><strong>Pioneer Park Library: </strong>C was around for our first toy-borrowing experience&nbsp;so she got to play with some new toys with Bean. Bean is now super excited when she sees a new toy from the library.</li>


    

<li><strong>St. Jacob&#8217;s and Anna Mae&#8217;s</strong> (Millbank): We also checked out the newly rebuilt St. Jacob&#8217;s market on a Thursday, and even though it was a weekday, it was bustling with people and it seemed a lot bigger in general: with vendors outside and inside of three separate buildings! At one booth, the woman remembered me from the Etsy show two weeks ago, and I found out that she sells her&nbsp;Calendula balm was actually $2 cheaper at the market &#8211; and it seemed to be an already reasonable price at the show! ($10 tax in at the market). We managed to catch a filling lunch at Anna Mae&#8217;s, a place my parents actually stumbled upon years back, famous for their broasted chicken and pies.</li>


    

<li><strong>The Museum:&nbsp;</strong>It was pretty much deserted at the Museum, which allowed ample time and space for them to play and explore. The two probably spent the most time in the infant and toddler area and the boat water station (just playing with the water, not exactly directing the boats downstream). Sadly, the top floor is now more geared for adults as opposed to children &#8211; gone is the sticker and balloon rooms and the science and nutrition stations. Bean enjoyed watching her grandfather flap his arms to a dinosaur game and playing in the color-changing sand pit; she also loved the star show (where we blasted off to many planets, including Jupiter, resulting in her new favourite planet and her frequent reminder asking me, &#8220;Do you remember we went to Jupiter?&#8221;) but C was &#8220;all done&#8221; had to leave&nbsp;shortly after it begun (fear of the dark?).</li>


    

<li><strong>Waterloo Park (Zoo):&nbsp;</strong>Bean was a lot more hesitant about the animals roaming around behind the fences at Waterloo Park, but C seemed to enjoy them, especially the llamas, since she knows a song about them. It seems like many of the animals seems to have disappeared, leaving behind overgrown and/or empty habitats including the bunnies and pigs.&nbsp;</li>


    

<li><strong>Shantz Family Farm:&nbsp;</strong>This farm is just five minutes down the road from us &#8211; I don&#8217;t know why we haven&#8217;t gone to it before as everything, including the corn maze is free. The two girls loved the plastic play toys (Little Tikes houses and slides) &nbsp;in the children&#8217;s straw maze area and Bean had a great time with accessible banana seat swings (as opposed to the diaper seats). When we visited on a weekday, it looked abandoned but this past Thanksgiving Monday, it was bustling with families &#8211; what a contrast! Bean was afraid of the animals during her first visit, but seemed to warm up to them to the point of wanting to watch and &#8220;feed&#8221; them on Thanksgiving Monday.</li>


    

<li><strong>Kitchener Market&nbsp;</strong>for Saturday produce and bacon shopping, iced pineapple tea and breadbaron, with a side visit to the Asian supermarket down the street. The children&#8217;s program was a bit too advanced for the two kids but they tried to glue a fall wreath together anyway.</li>


    

<li><strong>Oktoberfest:&nbsp;</strong>Because their visit coincided with the beginning of Oktoberfest, we took a trip downtown to check out the street vendors and happened to wander into Hockeytown instead. I thought it was a bit strange that Oktoberfest was so hockey-fied and thought maybe they were sponsors until I later learned that they were two different events in the same area. I think we enjoyed hockeytown more as they had more kid-friendly activities and freebies (including a free jersey for children under 16!).</li>


    

<li><strong>Stratford &#8211; The Sound of Music:&nbsp;</strong>The grandparents and j.w lovingly stayed at home to babysit while the sisters had a date to see the Sound of Music in Stratford (40 min leisurely drive &#8211; it seems like a lot shorter drive than 40 minutes on the&nbsp;401 towards Toronto for some reason), thanks to a Groupon-advertised $40 deal. We sat a row apart, next to the sound booth, but the view was great and the sound booth wasn&#8217;t much of a distraction &#8211; other than me noticing that the guy had the script and music score of the entire play in a binder and would be following along (though at times, he had to catch up a few pages); I do wonder if the AV guy has memorized most of it by now or is bored from seeing it over and over. My short review as posted on Facebook:


<blockquote>Wasn&#8217;t sure it was worth seeing the Sound of Music twice, but it was different enough and surprisingly, I enjoyed Stratford&#8217;s version more than Toronto&#8217;s &#8211; the key characters were believable, and I welcomed the comic relief (Max and the &#8220;cowboys&#8221; as referenced in the review &#8211; one vignette coincided well with Oktoberfest). If you have time before the season ends, go catch it!

When dining out, we celebrated my sister&#8217;s birthday at Dels and treated my mom to the westernized version of pig ears (fried and savoury sweet) at Fork and Cork Grill. We also managed two lunch visits to Mikey&#8217;s and shared some deep-fried tofu (they previously liked) and introduced them to their version of iced lemon tea, beef brisket noodle soup and condensed milk HK style french toast! j.w also took everyone to SOS BBQ for his favourite in town fish and chips, Downtown Crepe Cafe for cappuccino and crepes, Seven Shores for cappuccino and café mocha (my fave place for the latter), and to breadbaron for our family favourite sandwich place (ms piggy! though porksgiving is another fav of mine too when they don&#8217;t offer ms piggy). In Mississauga, we tried to visit the recommended Grand Chinese Cuisine, but it was closed to a private wedding reception (though my mother thinks that was a good thing as we found out later that a noodle dish is regularly $18!) so we ended up at Royal Jasmine (very salty but that&#8217;s all I know near the 401) and Phoenix (not to be confused with the chain in GTA), a HK style café which had great baked pork chop on fried rice and other good ha-ng-cha dishes overall!
If you&#8217;re a friend on Facebook, we&#8217;ve posted a <del>few</del> number of photos of them together.


<h3>Developmental progress</h3>




<div>Bean has picked up a few sayings and mannerisms from her cousin (and vice versa) and now sings a version of Veggie Tales&#8217; &#8220;where is my hairbrush&#8221; and Sesame Street&#8217;s &#8220;brush your teeth&#8221; song and says &#8220;nope&#8221; and &#8220;yep&#8221; in addition to her usual &#8220;no&#8221; and &#8220;yeah&#8221;;&nbsp;the strangest one yet seems to be her regression in being toilet&nbsp;trained&nbsp;for&nbsp;#2. She used to tell us when she needed to go but&nbsp;a few days into their visit, she actually went in her diaper (and didn&#8217;t tell me and even when I asked, she didn&#8217;t seem bothered), and even now, she ends up with a funny look (with her poking or picking her nose?!) while on occasion with some crying. When she does acknowledge that she needs to go, and I ask her about it, she tells me she needs to pee too (which she does&#8230;which I guess&nbsp;that&#8217;s progress to a degree!)</div>

In the shower the other day, I reflected on why God made people (and gave thanks to the friends I&#8217;ve known). And, echoing the thoughts of miss jo, certain people cross your path in life for some reason or another; maybe to make you less selfish in the process and/or to let you have a glimpse of how they live their lives differently. Lately, I&#8217;ve noticed how certain people interact with their families. When people are around family, their masks are let down and the real &#8220;them&#8221; shows through. If I had a spotlight of the month, I would highlight a friend of mine, who often says he is selfish (well, that&#8217;s something I need to work on as well!). Yet as an observer, I see beyond what he says and realise that often, love overcomes any hints of selfishness, or rather, action supersedes words. I don&#8217;t know if I would offer to cook my mother a meal so that she could sit down and enjoy a movie, or as a guy, to hug/kiss another family member openly in front of others. I know my brother stays as far away from hugs as possible because it&#8217;s &#8220;embarassing&#8221; and &#8220;not cool&#8221;, and yet, my friend (my age!) does this. I think if and when I have kids, it would be a blessing to have an affectionate family :).  I have a lot to learn.

<p>
On our way out after a talk by David C. Bentall last week, YY shouts, &#8220;Bye, Sheila!&#8221; I ignored the farewell until it registered to me that someone I knew just mistook me for my sister! I walked back and made it a point tell her that I wasn&#8217;t Sheila. And, when I did, she just had this blank look on her face and in bewilderment asked, &#8220;You&#8217;re not?! Then, who are you?&#8221; This incident reminded me of what happened last Christmas when I arrived at church before my sister. I went over to Becky to chat with her (fellow UWer). Tunger, one of my sister&#8217;s friends whom I didn&#8217;t know at the time, came up to me and greeted me with a familiar hello. I said hi back and Becky/I told him that I wasn&#8217;t Sheila. Turns out that he later tells my sister that he thought that I was her&#8230;this happened not only once, but three more times during this summer/fall season! I think he can tell us apart now, just because we&#8217;ve hung out more&#8230;it&#8217;s a good thing that my sister and I aren&#8217;t identical twins &#8211; else ppl would only be more confused!
</p>



<p>
PS. Hi Anne! How did you find me? I don&#8217;t think I know who you are, but nice to &#8220;meet&#8221; you <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
