								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				<![CDATA[The local libraries here aren't your typical traditional ones; sure you can borrow books, but they offer so much more. In addition to having resources like a media centre with a 3D printer and VR games, library patrons can borrow video games, toys, museum passes, and even internet hotspots; they also offer some really interesting programs for different age groups. I'm no stranger to circle time with wee ones, crafting terrariums, breaking out from a mini-escape-room, <a href="http://her.happyhippos.ca/2015/05/coffee-notes/">learning about </a>coffee, or watching new DVD releases in the library&#8217;s little theatre; everything is at and hosted by the library, and the best part is that they are all free! I sometimes wish I had more time or the waitlist to some of these weren&#8217;t so long (like the upcoming social paint nite and refreshments) [ref] this one filled up within 10 mins of open-registration[/ref])!
<span style="font-size: 16px;"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-5592" src="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_20170123_194337-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="739" height="554" srcset="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_20170123_194337-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_20170123_194337-300x225.jpg 300w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_20170123_194337-768x576.jpg 768w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_20170123_194337.jpg 1447w" sizes="(max-width: 739px) 100vw, 739px" />The other night, Ryan Horne from </span><a style="font-size: 16px;" href="https://www.facebook.com/foragergreens/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@ForagerGreens</a><span style="font-size: 16px;"> graciously gave a workshop at the library on how to make kombucha, offered samples of some of his kombucha, and brought everyone a container of starter brew + SCOBY (ready to be added to freshly brewed sweet tea). At the workshop, we found that he sells the starter kit for $20, so we just saved ourselves $20 &#8211; though it&#8217;s really the SCOBY that we&#8217;re after, as everything else we can easily source! Like </span><a style="font-size: 16px;" href="http://her.happyhippos.ca/2014/01/kefir-and-breast-milk/">the kefir</a><span style="font-size: 16px;"> that j.w now makes and drinks (whereby Bean happily drinks plain and gulps down the whey as if it was juice), all one needs is the active ingredient (Kefir &#8211; grains; Kombucha &#8211; SCOBY), and you&#8217;re good to go for awhile.</span>
I don&#8217;t know how my first batch will turn out; it&#8217;s sitting on another counter away from the kefir. If it&#8217;s doing what it&#8217;s supposed to be doing, the tea <del>will turn</del> is turning lighter, almost to a golden hue, as the week progresses, and a new layer of SCOBY <del>will be formed</del> is forming on top. Unlike kefir where you see a distinct separation of the &#8220;curds&#8221; and whey, there seems to be no obvious visual indicator, other than the color and that the SCOBY has formed a layer across / seal &#8211; and only if you&#8217;re paying attention. However, the final indication of both is the taste-test; if you like it, it&#8217;s ready.
Before my notes get all wrinkled and smudged, here&#8217;s what to know about kombucha:


<ul>
    

<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kombucha" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">kombucha</a>, Japanese in origin to mean &#8220;kelp tea&#8221; [ref]makes sense to me, since the stringy yeast on the SCOBY reminds me of kelp / seaweed at times[/ref], now it means fermented (sweet) tea. If you buy a commercial bottle in stores, you could spend anywhere from 3$ to 6$! Essentially, it&#8217;s made up of starter brew+SCOBY+brewed sweet tea.</li>


</ul>




<h2>Starter Brew</h2>


Fully brewed kombucha should smell like vinegar (or a faint smell if it&#8217;s not too strong), and a formula for starter brew comprises of: 1-2 cups of full brewed kombucha (the starter liquid) + SCOBY that is at least 1/8 inch thick (5oz) and should cover at least 1/2 of the surface area / opening of the jar/container/vessel, which is added to 1 gallon brewed tea; the more SCOBY you have, the more likely you will succeed. If you don&#8217;t have starter liquid, you can substitute it for a 1/4 cup of distilled vinegar.


<h2>SCOBY</h2>


What&#8217;s a SCOBY? It stands for Symbiotic Culture of Bacteria and Yeast.


<ul>
    

<li>A healthy one can look like a thin puck and it&#8217;s not unusual to see spits, holes, strands, floaties and strings of yeast[ref]edible, but most people filter it out[/ref]. When you pick it up, it should stay together and shouldn&#8217;t tear easily. A new SCOBY is beige, creamy in colour; the underside will likely look more weird than the top side, and colours of blue or purple aren&#8217;t unusual; it might sink, and that&#8217;s okay. If your container is too small for the SCOBY, it is safe to cut it up.</li>


    

<li>An older SCOBY can turn brown, work slower or stop working, but you can just keep it there in the batch. However, if you see mold on it, just scrap it and start new.   Signs of mold include powdery, dry splotches, specks in black, blue, or white; people have compared it to mold on an orange or a piece of bread.</li>


</ul>




<h2>Brew Environment and Equipment</h2>




<ul>
    

<li>Making an ideal brew: it thrives in 73-85F temperature, out of direct sunlight and avoid an exterior wall if possible. Don&#8217;t fill the container too full: leave some breathing space at the top of the container for the ecosystem to work; it also needs a &#8220;lid&#8221; that breathes such as a paper coffee filter, dish towel, or a piece of paper towel.</li>


    

<li>Food-grade plastic, glass, or stainless steel is okay, despite what online research may say</li>


</ul>




<h2>Brewing Sweet Tea</h2>




<ol>
    

<li>


<h3>Water</h3>




<ul>
    

<li>Must be chlorine-free, clean, potable</li>


    

<li>Avoid minerals &#8211; hard water can slow it down or kill it so if you&#8217;re using tap, boil it first and then let it sit overnight; then reboil it for tea</li>


</ul>


</li>


    

<li>


<h3>Sugar</h3>




<ul>
    

<li>1 cup sugar per 4L / 1 gallon of tea / kombucha. Don&#8217;t worry, 50-80% of the sugar gets converted</li>


    

<li>White is good; evaporated cane juice crystals is the best choice. A bag of Kirkland organic cane sugar is supposedly only $4!</li>


    

<li>If you decided to use honey, he recommends that you get the pasteurized kind because the raw, unpasteurized kind contains anti-bacterial properties, thus may kill it[ref]Jun, is a honey-based kombucha, and <a href="http://www.kombuchabrooklyn.com/blog/jun-honey-based-kombucha/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">using raw honey</a> seems to yield success[/ref]. Honey will result in a faster brew; same with maple syrup, so use less if you use either kind.</li>


    

<li>Do not use artificial or plant sugar (e.g. stevia, agave), as it won&#8217;t work</li>


</ul>


</li>


    

<li>


<h3>Tea</h3>




<ul>
    

<li>Black tea is the best; use bagged or loose</li>


    

<li>Avoid flavoured or herbal teas; any natural oils in them can kill the SCOBY (makes sense since some <a href="http://her.happyhippos.ca/2017/01/essential-oils-when-less-is-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">essential oils</a> have anti-fungal, anti-bacterial properties)</li>


    

<li>Should just stay &#8220;tea&#8221; in the ingredients; decaf is okay</li>


    

<li>Boil 4-5 bags of tea in a 2 gallon pot of water for 15+ minutes; cool it down to lower than body temperature before adding it to the starter brew</li>


</ul>


</li>


</ol>




<h2>Ready State</h2>




<ul>
    

<li>Is the kombucha ready to drink? You can use a straw (and a finger to suck up some tea) for the taste test, or more scientifically, you can also use PH strips to check for the ideal 3.5 PH; a PH of 4.0 is indicative of a new batch, &lt;3.0 is more potent. For a 2 gallon batch, it will start stating like apple cider vinegar around Day 5, and generally, a batch would be ready in about 7-10 days. If you want to slow the process down, you can put the whole thing in the fridge. You can pour it out in a batch and leave some starter brew (batch brew), or add a new batch of freshly brewed tea to the container (continuous brew)</li>


    

<li>When it&#8217;s ready, you can do a secondary fermentation, where you add 10-20% of fruit or other flavours in a bottle of ready kombucha, such as ginger or pear, with or without pulp. Leave it in room temperature for 1-5 days. Sealed will make more carbonation (be careful when opening)</li>


    

<li>You can put it in the fridge to cool it before drinking, or you can drink it straight up.</li>


</ul>




<h2>Clean up</h2>


When washing the jars and other equipment for kombucha, don&#8217;t use antibacterial soap, including on your hand; you can easily use hot water and vinegar to wash and rinse.
ENJOY!]]&gt;		</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				<![CDATA[When some friends asked me for suggestions for local hiking trails or places for a nice nature walk, I had to pause and use my memory and Google to help[ref]so I guess I can't blame them if all they could find was a hike that charged $7 a person to see a waterfall some 40 mins away[/ref]; it can sure be challenge to find suitable ideas.
To be honest, I've always wanted to explore some trails but have only maybe done a few as many of these trails are linear (and goes on for hours or days - with trail access at varies points) instead of loops, so it feels like there's a lot more effort to do them (either doubling back or need to park two cars and shuttle back), but this time of the year is probably one of my favourite times to do nature walks[ref]I call them walks instead of hikes as I'm used to West Coast terrain[/ref].

So, here are some in KWC for my (and hopefully your) future reference - most of which I've narrowed down based on distance / time and how scenic or interesting the trail might be:


<h3>Cambridge</h3>




<ul>
    

<li>Devil&#8217;s Creek Trail</li>


    

<li><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.raresites.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/seasonal-cliffs-and-alvars-trail-map.png" target="_blank" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=http://i2.wp.com/www.raresites.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/seasonal-cliffs-and-alvars-trail-map.png&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1476758739398000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGXMrMJMVUn2C6gI8iwmhIFpnF7xg" rel="noopener noreferrer">Trails along Blair Road (RARE):</a> the river side one has cliffs and water and a lookout (could extend to a loop); I always want to walk along this one when I drive by it</li>


</ul>




<h3>Kitchener</h3>




<ul>
    

<li><a href="http://www.ontariotrails.on.ca/trails/view/homer-watson-park-trail" target="_blank" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=http://www.ontariotrails.on.ca/trails/view/homer-watson-park-trail&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1476758739398000&amp;usg=AFQjCNF5qmFYeWJXYsdUNjwUdrYtYwPILA" rel="noopener noreferrer">Homer Watson Park:</a> a 10-second walk from the car leads me to my favourite spot for a fall photo (one that overlooks the Grand River with coloured trees on either side). I discovered this sometime ago, from hunting around online, as it&#8217;s hidden and tucked away, but I haven&#8217;t actually ventured too far along the trail.&nbsp; Someone has kindly documented a 8km loop if you&#8217;re feeling adventurous or park a car at one end and walk to another parking spot and drive back to get the other car &#8211; ‎<a href="http://www.hember.ca/hikes/HomerWatson/" target="_blank" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=http://www.hember.ca/hikes/HomerWatson/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1476758739398000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHoJqTlz1Ag20rPH1QpbkkUZL0aJA" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://www.hember.ca/hikes/HomerWatson/</a>
Or, you can try for a shorter loop: <a href="http://hember.ca/hikes/HomerWatsonDoon/index.html" target="_blank" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=http://hember.ca/hikes/HomerWatsonDoon/index.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1476758739398000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFrPAGylOPdPgrWn2f3M14duu42gA" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://hember.ca/hikes/<wbr>HomerWatsonDoon/</wbr></a></li>

It continues on, but that&#8217;s where we turned around last time. Could also Google <a href="http://www.walterbeantrail.ca/ap_kuntz.htm">Kuntz Park</a> for more info.</li>

<a href="https://www.kitchener.ca/en/livinginkitchener/HuronNaturalArea.asp">Huron Natural Area</a> is my go-to for urban, easy loop walks and nearest to our house (one trail goes around a pond where on a sunny day you can spot turtles sunbathing, and in the fall, the leaves look really nice across the still water). My friends ended up choosing this place, and some told me that they didn&#8217;t even know this place existed before this! (I&#8217;m glad they ended up having a nice leisurely walk)[ref]The same someone also documented a possible 5km and 8km loop:<a href="http://www.hember.ca/hikes/HuronNaturalArea/index.html" target="_blank" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=http://www.hember.ca/hikes/HuronNaturalArea/index.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1476758739398000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEVt9gnOhgms5wwwfWbkDPM1qI1qQ" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://www.hember.ca/hikes/HuronNaturalArea</a>[/ref]</li>


</ul>




<h3>Waterloo/St. Jacobs</h3>


[caption id="" align="alignright" width="500"]<a title="IMG_9667" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/aimeili/6320456853/in/album-72157602404604327/" data-flickr-embed="true" data-footer="true"><img src="https://c6.staticflickr.com/7/6110/6320456853_0f1d4eb5d1_n.jpg" alt="Race Mill trail" width="500" height="333"/></a> A Mennonite man walks with two kids across the train trestle[/caption]


<ul>
    

<li>Health Valley Trail: This one is a challenge to find it seems but you walk to downtown St Jacobs from Waterloo, so you could have lunch there after!</li>


    

<li><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>Mill Race trail: in the village of St. Jacobs, goes under a train trestle, a next to a creek in some spots, see some chipmunks or frogs, some farm land, and if you&#8217;re lucky you&#8217;ll also hear gun shots. At the end of the 2km linear trail, you will see a small dam (so it&#8217;s like a mini-waterfall, right?)</li>


    

<li>The <a href="http://thehydrocut.ca/">Hydrocut</a> (specifically, only the multi-use trail): this might offer a more challenging terrain (enter via the <a href="http://thehydrocut.ca/trails-map">Snyders Road parking lot</a>) ‎but be warned that despite it being a multi-use trail, you may encounter many mountain biking enthusiasts &#8211; as it&#8217;s &#8220;their&#8221; trail around here. And I&#8217;ve been told there&#8217;s plenty of mosquitoes (but I&#8217;d imagine other places w trees and water might too)</li>


    

<li><a href="http://www.waterloo.ca/en/gettingactive/geotimetrail.asp">GeoTime trail</a>: This 4.5 km one seems like it would be an informative / educational walk vs. a hike &#8211; the concept is kind of neat, and I didn&#8217;t know this existed either; thanks, @jowu!</li>


</ul>


And then, there are walks with a purpose: to <a href="https://fallingfruit.org/?z=16&amp;y=43.43180&amp;x=-80.49604&amp;m=false&amp;t=roadmap&amp;l=true&amp;locale=en&amp;c=forager,freegan">harvest fruit</a> along the pathways!
Are there anymore that are worth checking out?]]&gt;		</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				<![CDATA[I often look forward to Saturdays because there is still one more day left before the work week begins again. If I don't have a chance to sleep in, and j.w doesn't take the kids (or leaves me one while he plays MTG), it means that we can spend time together as a family -&nbsp;this usually means we do our weekly shopping trip at Costco or&nbsp;the Kitchener Market.
A couple Saturdays ago, it was certainly a nice kind of different:&nbsp;we took part of a little library&nbsp;community build and we visited the region's waste management site. &nbsp;


<h3>Little Library &#8211; Community Build</h3>

At the start of the year,&nbsp;I had shared with j.w two of my <del>resolutions</del>[ref]I don&#8217;t believe in resolutions as I don&#8217;t (like to) make promises I can&#8217;t keep[/ref] goals for the year, which he has helped me to meet: make our bed daily (a little step towards to tidiness) and get a little library up and running in our front yard (community).
A community build event took place and j.w put together most of the little library house. To our surprise, we now share another thing in common with our neighbours two houses down: not only do our sons share the same first name, but they also have the same gable-style library that they picked up the same morning!
Sometime this summer, I aim to paint/stain it, seal it, and then put it up with some family-friendly reading, primarily books in the Christian and children genre. While there are plenty of other little libraries with children&#8217;s literature, I wonder what the uptake will be on Christian books. I have other little ideas for it, including maybe a Facebook group to post what&#8217;s available, a NFC check-in tag, as well a QR tag to track the location and review of the books that go through our little library &#8211; those are lofty ideas, so we shall see.


<h3>Waterloo Region Waste Management &#8211; Open House</h3>


[caption id="attachment_5222" align="alignright" width="300"]<img class="wp-image-5222 size-medium" src="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/IMG_20160423_122123-300x225.jpg" alt="Recycled material" height="225" width="300" srcset="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/IMG_20160423_122123-300x225.jpg 300w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/IMG_20160423_122123-768x576.jpg 768w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/IMG_20160423_122123-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/IMG_20160423_122123-1568x1176.jpg 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /> Cubes of compacted recycled cans[/caption]
After a morning of building most of the little library, we rushed to the waste management site. I had signed us up to go because of Bean&#8217;s interest in garbage trucks and buses &#8211; a school bus was to take us on a tour of the site, with pauses at the current landfill, and a stop at the recycling centre. If their goal of open houses is to send an environmental message home, I think it achieved it with our family; it probably ended up being the most educational for us, the parents. Here&#8217;s what I learned:


<ul>
    

<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_box_recycling_system#History" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The (now world-wide) blue box recycling program started in Kitchener</a></li>


    

<li>The waste management site &#8220;hires&#8221; two <a href="http://www.therecord.com/news-story/4260095-this-job-is-for-the-birds/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hawks to send seagulls away</a> a few times a week</li>


    

<li>Mount Trashmore, our local popular tobogganing hill, was discontinued as a landfill in the &#8217;70s</li>


    

<li>Landfills that are at max capacity are capped with ceramic before being topped with soil and grass</li>


    

<li>Items you throw in the garbage that you know are biodegradable or claims to biodegrade in X days won&#8217;t actually ever if it ends up in the landfill because the environment isn&#8217;t right for it; it actually gets packed down (sort of WALL-E-like), so it lacks oxygen and organisms that break it down</li>


    

<li>A tarp-like sheet goes over every layer of garbage to keep it from blowing away and fumes and moisture are sent through pipes, where the methane gas is collected and converted into energy; I didn&#8217;t see any burning pipes anywhere, nor did it smell nearly as bad as the one we used to drive back next to Highway 1 back home before it got converted to a driving range</li>


</ul>


You could say that we unknowingly took part in some Earth Day weekend activities, with a specific focus on recycling / reusing (books in the community instead of the garbage, and learning about recycling operations in our city). It felt like a long day, but it wasn&#8217;t even mid-afternoon yet by the time we finished! While I do enjoy doing our regular stops, after this past Saturday&#8217;s activities together as a family, I find it&#8217;s worth waking up early if it means doing something different.
Some neat upcoming events in May around #kwawesome that you could do with your family, a date, or friends are:


<ul>
    

<li>Saturday, May 7, 9-10:30a <a href="http://janeswalk.org/canada/kitchener/lets-have-coffee-or-10/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Coffee walk around Downtown Kitchener (DTK)</a></li>


    

<li>Sunday, May 8, 2p <a href="http://janeswalk.org/canada/kitchener/spur-line-trail-smile-tiger-berlin-bicycle-cafe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Coffee tour bike-ride on Spur Line Trail</a></li>


    

<li>Friday, May 27, 6-7p Listening choir DTK (probably not suitable for families with little ones, as they will likely get impatient or lose attention since there&#8217;s no speaking and you stand and appreciate the urban noise) &#8211; other dates are also available</li>


</ul>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				<![CDATA[Now that the <a href="http://her.happyhippos.ca/2015/11/things-to-do-in-kw/">adults have ideas on what #kwawesome offers</a>, here&#8217;s a list of no or low-cost drop-in programs that are toddler friendly. While the local libraries, Early Years Centres, and some community centres / associations have great programs for children and caregivers, most of them require registration. I didn&#8217;t take Bean to many programs when she was younger because they were all offered in the morning, which conflicted with her morning nap; now that she&#8217;s just napping in the afternoon, these times work better for us. Drop-in programs are also great for us because it allows flexibility: on low-key days,  or the times we don&#8217;t have the car or the weather isn&#8217;t bussing or walking friendly, we can choose to stay in.
This list is really to help me keep a track of what&#8217;s being offered during the fall and winter terms around us (the start of summer usually means the end of some programs):

<li><strong>Mondays:</strong> <a href="http://kitchener.ca/en/resources/NA_CFNA_Fall_2015.pdf">Tot Spot at Downtown Community Centre</a>, 9:30-11:30 AM $2/tot</li>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				<![CDATA[

<div>A few nights ago, a friend asked me what there was to do in Kitchener-Waterloo, and how I found out about them. This isn&#8217;t&nbsp;the first time someone has asked for ideas, so I figured a compiled list of what I follow may be helpful to my other self and for future reference &#8211; and even though I don&#8217;t necessarily have time do venture out to many events offered around time, I still try sometimes! So what piques my interest? Generally, I like to know about free/low-cost activities that don&#8217;t need&nbsp;too much&nbsp;commitment.</div>




<div>&nbsp;</div>




<div>Here are some of my sources:</div>




<ul>
    

<li>Meetup groups &#8211; a few that I subscribe to, include:


<ul>
    

<li>Badminton Fun in KW&nbsp;&#8211; John sends out a reminder of places that offer drop-in badminton around town (mostly at community centres)</li>


    

<li><a href="http://www.meetup.com/Tri-Cities-Food-Lovers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tri-Cities Food Lovers &#8211;</a> I tend to follow this group for restaurant ideas (haven&#8217;t been to a meetup yet)</li>


    

<li><a href="http://www.meetup.com/Its-On-Events-for-20s-30s-at-Kitchener-Public-Library/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">It&#8217;s On &#8211; Events for 20s and 30s</a>&nbsp;&#8211; a central place for all the events that Kitchener Public Library offers for a specific crowd, though open to all. Note that registration actually happens on the KPL site itself, and that most of it is just a repeat of what&#8217;s listed on the KPL Events Calendar (but easier to find here).</li>


    

<li><a href="http://www.meetup.com/Hiking-for-Beginners-in-Cambridge-ON/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hiking for Beginners</a> &#8211; while the group says Cambridge, Ontario, I find that a bunch of the hikes are actually in the Kitchener area. I tend to follow them to discover trails around me as the timing for the meetups hasn&#8217;t been right for me yet.</li>


    

<li>I also follow the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/KW-Chinese-English-Language-and-Cultural-Exchange/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chinese-English Social Cultural Exchange</a> meetup group to keep a tabs on Chinese eating places around town</li>


</ul>


</li>


    

<li>Public Library events


<ul>
    

<li>I tend to find out about interesting events from the library posters, TV screens, and their <a href="http://www.libraryaware.com/1111/Subscribers/Subscribe?showonlynewsletterlists=true">newsletters</a>;&nbsp;e.g. Etc., Music Notes, KPL News. Popular events that have limited seats tend to fill quickly, and if you end up registering late, you&#8217;ll be added to a waitlist. A few that I&#8217;ve attended include one on <a href="http://her.happyhippos.ca/2015/05/coffee-notes/">coffee</a>, making your own terrarium during #diyfestival,&nbsp; interior design, and an upcoming ones that seem interesting&nbsp;is an&nbsp;art class, an escape room adventure featured for international games day, and a <a href="http://kplca.evanced.info/signup/EventDetails.aspx?EventId=11432&amp;lib=" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DIY string art piece</a>.</li>


    

<li>You can also <a href="http://kplca.evanced.info/signup/EventCalendar.aspx">filter events in the calendar</a> to browse for ones that interest you (hint: set filters by Date: today&#8217;s date, leave end date open; Event type: Adult, Arts &amp; Culture, Business; Age Group: Adults &#8211; List view). Notably, KPL Central branch offers a weekly free movie&nbsp;screening in their theatre space.</li>


</ul>


</li>


    

<li>Community Centres / Community Associations tend to offer many classes at a reasonable cost, but they usually require registration and a 8-10 weeks of commitment. I find that I have to browse through the leisure guides physically because&nbsp;the online versions aren&#8217;t very browseable (ref. <a href="http://issuu.com/cityofwaterloo/docs/waterloo_fall2015_web?e=1669671/14829852" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Waterloo</a> / Kitchener). I&#8217;ve noticed that similar classes tend to vary in price depending on where it&#8217;s offered, perhaps because of&nbsp;each community centre&#8217;s surrounding demographics (e.g. Downtown Kitchener seems to have lower drop-in prices than say RIM Park in Waterloo)


<ul>
    

<li>Cooking classes</li>


    

<li>Art classes (e.g. $5 a class for drawing)</li>


    

<li>Language classes (e.g. ASL &#8211; $5+ /class, Spanish, Conversational Chinese &#8211; $5 a class on Saturday mornings)</li>


    

<li>Social Dance / Ballroom dancing&nbsp;classes, even more affordable than the ones taught at University of Waterloo (outside of&nbsp;the clubs)</li>


    

<li>Drop-in sport activities &#8211; organized and self-organized, such as badminton (from $3 a session)</li>


</ul>


</li>


    

<li><a href="https://enews.kitchener.ca/enews/signup.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">City of Kitchener</a> and <a href="http://enews.waterloo.ca/mailinglist/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">City of Waterloo</a> newsletters, which include a Kitchener Market sub-newsletter


<ul>
    

<li>By extension, the <a href="http://www.downtownkitchener.ca/en/index.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Downtown Kitchener BIA </a>also offers a e-newsletter that&nbsp;highlights events such as <a href="http://nightshiftwr.ca/">NightShift</a> and Art Market, and the <a href="http://frederickartwalk.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">annual Art Walk </a>(local artisans featuring their works for sale)</li>


</ul>


</li>


    

<li>Free <a href="http://www.kitchener.ca/en/livinginkitchener/public_skating_schedule.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">community skating </a>/ <a href="http://www.timhortons.com/ca/en/social/free-swimming.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">swimming / aqua-fit</a> sessions</li>


    

<li>Theatre:


<ul>
    

<li><a href="http://kwlt.org/events" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">KW Little Theatre &#8211; some nights by donation or pay-what-you-can</a></li>


    

<li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/arts/alumni-friends" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Arts Alumni Theatre Night &#8211; free, registration required</a>&nbsp;&#8211; productions by current students at UW</li>


    

<li><a href="http://www.lostandfoundtheatre.com/index.php/ct-menu-item-11/ct-menu-item-13" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lost and Found Theatre &#8211; free nights</a>&nbsp;</li>


</ul>


</li>


    

<li>Free academic / public lectures, for the geek-nerds in us, such as:


<ul>
    

<li><a href="http://perimeterinstitute.ca/outreach/general-public/public-lecture-series" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PI Institute</a>&nbsp;&#8211; I have attended a couple in the past, one on music and physics</li>


    

<li>University of Waterloo <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/hagey-lectures/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Public Lectures</a> (and any of its affiliated colleges)</li>


</ul>


</li>


    

<li>Miscellaneous:


<ul>
    

<li>I really enjoyed the events that Clipped Outdoors offered for women, but they haven&#8217;t been active in a while so I wonder what happened&#8230;</li>


    

<li>Community events offered by local churches&nbsp;(e.g. canning, community gardening) &#8211; I find out about them usually from their signs as a passerby</li>


</ul>


</li>


</ul>
