								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				With just about two months to go, I feel so inadequately prepared, especially since the items on my mental checklist are still outstanding, so I don&#8217;t feel ready. Perhaps it&#8217;s also because I feel like we don&#8217;t have a strong support community around us, that&#8217;s close by, in the same life stage, especially after hearing j.w say out loud and identify that it&#8217;s what&#8217;s missing in KW &#8211; as compared to Toronto (NT brothers and sisters really). I think spending time with the NT community causes us to feel this gap, and him to miss Toronto more.<br />
Physically, I still feel pretty good, with enough energy to walk a half hour to Mel&#8217;s Diner (2.3 km says Google), weed (on a stool, with <a title="Jo's blog" href="http://jopoo.blogspot.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">family</a> help), continuing badminton weekly, and go camping and canoeing. However, I am beginning to feel some of the signs of a pregnant woman in her third trimester:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="line-height: 13px;">A more itchy belly (which seems to have stemmed from camping)</span></li>
<li>a realization that her goofy pillow really helps with sleeping (also realized during camping, but the recently bought thermarests not only saved her back but also kept her warm with temperatures dropping to 2C overnight, brrr)</li>
<li>More difficulty in reaching down / bending over to put on socks or shoes</li>
<li>Slight increased pressure on bladder</li>
<li>Increased conversations with people, especially women, about the expectant one</li>
</ul>
<p> Turtles at Pinery Provincial Park (photo by j.w)<br />
Car camping (for the city folk), by the way, was fun despite the chill. God answered our prayers, our very specific ones: I prayed for dry, sunny weather, and Dan prayed that it would be bug-free; we forgot to pray for warm weather <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Aside from the times changing out of and into clothes, I think we were okay: we had thermarest mats, our sleeping bag is rated up to -7C and I learned why a small tent is handy to have at times: heat retention and ease of setup / take-down (compared to the 12-person tent that anyone can stand in, that the girls had and froze in). Too bad, j.w was sick so I&#8217;m sure it wasn&#8217;t as fun for him. We were at Pinery again (luxury camping with 2 ply toilet paper and very clean public washrooms!) I don&#8217;t think I would book that site again (Burley 1201, 1202, 1203); while it is close to the comfort station, it&#8217;s very close to adjacent sites and sometimes you could smell the waft of sewage and the sound of the generators from the comfort station, depending on the wind direction and strength O_o Unfortunately, you can&#8217;t really get a good visual idea by looking at the map until you get to a specific camp site, but last year, we had Dune 104, which I really liked But, our site actually worked out as we were able to fit everyone around the fire pit comfortably. This time, we also saw so many (families of) turtles sunbathing on the logs, and we had Shaw&#8217;s ice cream at reasonable prices. Maybe we&#8217;ll try going again in a couple year&#8217;s time.		</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				Fall has often been our summer. This year: visiting friends in Durham, camping, dragon boat racing, weekends in Stratford, Hawaii&#8230;<br />
Despite my zero tolerance for swimming (because I can&#8217;t and don&#8217;t like water), I&#8217;ve always enjoyed being in a canoe, despite vector-winds in Pitt Lake, Pitt Meadows and a canoe tip resulting in my uncle dislocating his shoulder. I&#8217;ve also convinced myself to try surfing once because it looked doable (crazy younger self).<br />
Maybe that&#8217;s why I&#8217;ve been curious about dragon boating for awhile, seeing posts from friends and activity on Facebook, so when a coworker casually asked me to try it out, I went for it. While challenging at times, I&#8217;ve learned that it takes a lot of commitment (weekly practices 45 minutes away), discipline, and team effort. But, actually, it was enjoyable and it was fun. So, maybe, just maybe next season &#8211; if the team is still around&#8230;<br />
Maybe I should learn how to swim.&#65279;		</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				First off: I&#8217;m not much of a camper. I&#8217;ve only ever done car camping, only found out this year that it&#8217;s called &#8220;car camping&#8221;, and don&#8217;t like bugs or having to <em>go</em>&nbsp;outdoors. I&#8217;ve only gone tent camping only a handful of times in my life: 3 times in Ontario; this was our first since marriage.<br />
But, on pure whim, and in a hurry to use up my benefits (preventative move*), we bought a tent &#8211; a pretty pricey one at that. I was excited to try it out, so we went to a relatively close campsite: the Dunes at Pinery Provincial Park in Grand Bend, just 1.5 hours away.<br />
It&#8217;s probably the best campsite that I&#8217;ve been to <em>ever: </em>the site has activities including bike rentals to explore trails, canoe rentals to paddle down the channel and count the number of blue herons and turtles (much cleaner than Grand River!), a laundry facility, clean washrooms, and private and warm/hot showers! Park staff go around daily emptying garbage cans and cleaning the washrooms. Falling asleep to the pitter patter of rain against the tent &#8211; and staying dry, and waking up to the sounds of the waves crashing hard against the beach because of the wind, <em>almost </em>had me believing that I was not in Ontario. And nothing like warming by the fire with gooey toasted marshmellows and smoked hot dogs.<br />
And then, we discovered the strip in Grand Bend, where there are <em>surf </em>shops with rentals and lessons, but at this time of the year (September after Labour Day), the area feels ike a ghost down, but has great deals (like Natives for $6)!&nbsp;<br />
No wonder families like this campsite. Hopefully we&#8217;ll get to use it more often so we can get our money&#8217;s worth <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><br />
&#8212;<br />
*Regarding note about preventative move: earlier, my Facebook statuses had the following two verses, and the mood certainly felt apocolyptic at one point, a reminder that no one knows the day or hour:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px;">&#8220;<span id="en-NIV1984-23995" class="text Matt-24-40"><span class="woj">Two men will be in the field; one will be taken and the other left.<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><span id="en-NIV1984-23996" class="text Matt-24-41"><span class="woj">Two women will be grinding with a hand mill; one will be taken and the other left.&#8221; Matthew 24:40-41 (NIV 1984)</span></span>&#65279;</p>
<p>&lt;<br />
p style=&#8221;margin-left: 30px;&#8221;><span>&#8220;Now faith is being sure of what we hope for and certain of what we do not see.&#8221; Hebrews 11:1</span>&#65279; (NIV 1984)		</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				1999, the year I was introduced to Final Fantasy. I have yet to play a single game, but it was through Faye Wong&#8217;s rendition of &#8216;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eyes_on_Me_%28Faye_Wong_song%29" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Eyes on Me</a>&#8216; that I remember encountering the characters of Final Fantasy for the first time; I enjoyed watching the storyline, but I had no patience to play through it. Our friend, Carey, was the source for what&#8217;s new in the Canto community (like the movie&nbsp;<big>風雲</big> The Storm Riders) &#8211; or maybe it was just what he liked &#8211; and this song was one of them. It wasn&#8217;t long before that it made it into the binder at karaoke shops, as it was very easy to sing along.<br />
Actually, even though I haven&#8217;t played any of the games, I paid to watch <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_Fantasy:_The_Spirits_Within" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Final Fantasy: the Spirits Within</a> in the theatres. I remember thinking it didn&#8217;t have very much plot, but I thought the animation and the soundtrack were both quite good, despite it sounding depressing, so I actually ended up listening to the soundtrack multiple times afterwards. I also saw <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_Fantasy_VII_Advent_Children#Reception" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Final Fantasy: Advent Children</a>, but I don&#8217;t remember much from it.<br />
I must have been exposed to more Final Fantasy without knowing it over the years, because at the Final Fantasy: Distant Worlds concert with <a href="http://kwsymphony.ca/finalfantasy/index.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">KW Symphony</a>, conducted by Arnie Roth, I recognized quite a number of pieces, including the one that&#8217;s been playing on the TV in our living room for the past few weeks (j.w is working through Final Fantasy XIII). If it&#8217;s any indication of how many hours he&#8217;s been playing it, as soon as the conductor said, &#8220;&#8230;Blinding Light from Final Fantasy XIII&#8221;, I nudged j.w and whispered, THAT&#8217;S THE SONG! He looked at me quizzically and then upon hearing the key notes after the intro, he gave me a look that said, &#8220;How did you know!?&#8221;<br />
I&#8217;m glad KW Symphony reduced the prices of those $80 tickets; that was a nice treat (though it wasn&#8217;t a full house which might explain why &#8211; so next time, I might look for last minute seats again). Even though it ended up to be $35 each for A seats (Mezzaine 3rd row center), I feel like we got a better deal than Toronto&#8217;s, especially since the one in Toronto is played by KW Symphony anyway! Granted, the composer <a title="Nobuo Uematsu" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobuo_Uematsu" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nobuo Uematsu</a> wasn&#8217;t there nor did Arnie Roth play a Violin solo, unlike the Toronto performance, but I don&#8217;t feel like that justifies the difference (balcony seats in Toronto are now selling for $83.50). We got to hear previews from FFIX, but I especially liked the encore piece, One-Winged Angel (FFVII); the audience got to participate by being the chorus and singing Seph-i-roth!<br />
Watching the percussionists run around scrambling to be in position so that they can hit their beat in time was quite entertaining to watch, and hearing Susan Calloway sing &#8216;Eyes on Me&#8217; brought it back full circle. So, I guess it was a pretty fun night out at the symphony again (just like <a title="Video Games Live" href="http://her.happyhippos.ca/2009/03/video-games-live/">Video Games Live</a> and Star Trek). And, by saying that, it must make me sound like a huge nerd.		</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				The name, &#8216;Talent Attraction Lab&#8217; seemed clinical but it also had a mysterious draw to it. Yes, I was curious, curious enough to sign up and voluntell j.w to go as well. Afterall, I knew what drew me to Waterloo (school, job), but didn&#8217;t really explore why I had stayed, and what would make Waterloo Region &#8220;a better fit&#8221;. I also wanted to hear if others had similar or different stories.<br />
Turned out, only 3 of us attended with 2 moderators (one facilitator, the other a note taker) and we went through a couple of exercises, one being an emphathy map! I was even more interested because I had wanted to see how an empathy map worked, after hearing about it at UX Week 2011.<br />
<img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/--Kt2agyGG_0/TssxIqPowOI/AAAAAAAAFr4/hpKKANVot9E/s400/IMG-20110928-00007.jpg" alt=""/><br />
On the empathy map, we were to jot down thoughts that came to us around what we see, say, do, feel, hear, and think about the Region of Waterloo.<br />
The second exercise was to create a post-it map (if I remember correctly) resulting from our feelings of why we came to Waterloo, what we liked (to do) in the area, and what the area lacked (ie. what where we came from had, that the area was missing &#8211; and what was so meaningful about it). I remember posting &#8220;mountains and ocean&#8221; as something I missed, but it was more than just the scenery &#8211; it was the accessibility to the great outdoors/natural scenic trails, to spend time with people who enjoyed doing that, and access to quality seafood.<br />
The discussions that around these exercises was what was interesting: noted attitudes of the people of Waterloo versus Kitchener, the continued growth of the city (visible through infrastructure changes such as bus routes, construction, loud planes), and among all of it, I think we were in agreement that what keeps people around is their identity in the community. A community is about its people, and without them, or without people involvement, the community becomes lifeless, dull, and uninteresting; community creates the culture. This idea isn&#8217;t anything new, but I could see visually see that now, through these exercises.<br />
And, after spending over 7 years here now post-graduation,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.418617594887.199591.505029887&amp;type=1&amp;l=beba1aa403" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">I can still be intentional about making my time in Waterloo the best it can be</a>.		</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I had wanted to go to Niagara-on-the-Lake for a quiet weekend getaway, without knowing that all reasonable accommodations were fully booked. Tobermory was another choice, but they too were full. So what do I do? Look in our <i>Where to Eat in Canada</i> book for some inspiration, hoping that we might be able to find a place that would at least have some good food!</p>
<p>Enter Port Stanley: an hour and a half drive from Waterloo. Half an hour from London, and on the north side of Lake Erie. A town with only one traffic light, and a lift bridge (that didn&#8217;t lift when we were there). Calm, serene, and peaceful. And, it offers two sand beaches: Little Beach (one more suitable for quiet lounging) and the Main Beach &#8211; long stretch of beach, big waves, and lifeguards on duty. Plus, everything is within walking distance.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aimeili/4962513628/" title="IMG_7073 by b.p., on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4092/4962513628_728272efcf.jpg" width="400" height="266" alt="IMG_7073" /></a></p>
<p>We started the weekend with cool weather, on the tourist train, much like the St. Jacob&#8217;s train, but with open windows. Unfortunately, the engine broke down halfway through our trip and we ended up being stranded for awhile &#8211; until they could bring another engine to push the train. We ended the night with a play <i>Wrong for Each Other</i> at the local festival theatre, and it was especially comical, because we actually do &#8220;fight&#8221; like that sometimes.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aimeili/4962425790/" title="IMG_6868 by b.p., on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4127/4962425790_e403fded9e.jpg" width="400" height="266" alt="IMG_6868" /></a></p>
<p>On the first day, we visited the two restaurants that were mentioned in <i>Where to Eat in Canada</i>: M.E. and Suzie&#8217;s for a late lunch and Windjammer Inn for dinner before the show. We quickly found out that Lake Erie Yellow Perch is the local specialty &#8211; fresh tasting too: light and not fishy. We loved the way Windjammer made the perch (served with seasonal veggies) and their flourless dark chocolate cake was amazing: warm and not too sweet or rich! M.E. and Suzie&#8217;s own brew seemed good, and their ale and white cheddar soup was certainly unique (and not too salty surprisingly). Both places had hot bread: crispy on the outside, moist and soft on the inside. One even had lime or lemon zest in/taste to it.</p>

<p>It wasn&#8217;t only at the restaurants where we enjoyed good food. We had stumbled upon a great bed and breakfast: the <a href="http://www.telegraphhouse.com/index.php/Accommodations/Index" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Telegraph House</a>. Of the many places we tried to inquire about room availability, this one was the only one that had an opening at a fair price. So, due to limited choices, we took the last room that was available, not certain if we ended up with an okay place.</p>
<p>What we got was more than expected &#8211; loose leaf tea available for guests, a room that was spacious, had great lighting, and enough privacy and freedom that I felt like we were at an inn instead of a B&#038;B. The bed looked soft; you could put you palm on it and it would sink, but when I slept on it, it felt firm enough. I hadn&#8217;t slept on a feather bed before, but if that&#8217;s what it feels like, it was comfortable. The only down side for this room is that the bathroom is down the hall (knew before booking) and fireplace wasn&#8217;t on yet, despite the chilly first night. One bonus is that if your own private washroom was occupied, the other person could use the public one without it being too far away.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aimeili/4962457672/" title="IMG_6904 by b.p., on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4109/4962457672_7d008f2673.jpg" width="400" height="266" alt="IMG_6904" /></a></p>
<p>I was already drawn to this B&#038;B when I saw their breakfast menu online and the variety of choices. I guess one might expect good food from Jon and Vicci (the hosts), considering they owned a restaurant in London once upon a time and that the public dining room (at the time of operation) at the B&#038;B is the third top-rated place in Port Stanley on Restaurantica.com &#8211; after M.E &#038;  Suzie&#8217;s, Winjammer Inn, and then Mackie&#8217;s. When even locals recommend it, including the server at Windjammer Inn, you know that you are at the right spot.  As one who takes every opportunity to sleep-in, I wasn&#8217;t about to sleep-in and miss this breakfast!</p>

<p>Oh, and let&#8217;s not forget about the lemon meringue pie! Earlier in the day, a local from St. Thomas had raved about their deep-dish rhubarb pie, so she was surprised to find out that they closed the dining room to the public. Vicci didn&#8217;t have rhubarb (not in season is my guess), but she let us try the lemon meringue instead. What a pleasant surprise: a light, not-to-sweet summery pie and the meringue itself wasn&#8217;t stiff at all &#8211; you could almost see the lemon zest in the setting sun!</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				<b>Update:</b> March 9, 2010 &#8211; it appears the Le Gourmand LG3, as reviewed below is now closed, as explained by Toronto Life.</p>
<hr />
My last post about our tasting adventures in Toronto ended with a mention of Le Gourmand.</p>
<h3>Le Gourmand (LG3)</h3>
<p>2177 Yonge Street (near Eglinton)<br />
Toronto, ON<br />
Phone number not listed for this location, but follow them on twitter<br />
Date of visit: June 2, 2009</p>
<h3>Restaurant</h3>
<p>On the way back from Quince, we happened to glance across the street and saw the sign for Le Gourmand, which looked like an expensive steakhouse. When we peered through the glass window, we realized that it felt more like a gourmet, European-style cafe. After taking a look at the menu that&#8217;s posted on the side of the glass door and realized it was within our budget and that the menu (PDF) looked appetizing enough, we tentatively decided on this place for the following night. Grace went home to do some research online, but came up with limited information since it is relatively new. We both knew that every time a fresh batch of cookies came out of the oven, they would tweet it. With a restaurant that&#8217;s keeps up with the times (BlackBerry + twitter) and the rave reviews of their nookie cookies, how could we pass up the chance?<br />
Inside, it looks like a deli cafe, where you can order at the counter (to go) or they serve you at your table. The place isn&#8217;t big so the seating arrangement is somewhat tight, but there&#8217;s a lot of natural light that comes in through the windows, which is supplemented by candles when it gets darker out. I just hope the ant that <i>was</i> (and he is no more) crawling on the window sill was just a one-time occurrence.</p>
<h3>Meal choice, food quality</h3>
<p>Grace ordered the Charcuterie mix platter ($18), which is really just a very expensive tray of smoked gourmet cold cuts that you don&#8217;t normally see anywhere else. This is paired with some bread crackers, which are slightly crisper than the bread they also serve before your meal. I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;d order it on its own, but to share it with my Mint Tagliatelle (braise lamb with mint pasta for $19), it was perfect. Actually, it would&#8217;ve been good with wine, but that wasn&#8217;t in our budget.<br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aimeili/3627961152/" title="IMG_0028 by b.p., on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3597/3627961152_f40c4b4313_m.jpg" width="200" height="130" alt="IMG_0028" /></a><br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aimeili/3594533358/" title="IMG_0026 by b.p., on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3600/3594533358_d2245c6d58_m.jpg" width="200" height="130" alt="IMG_0026" /></a><br />
Some of the smoked meats were more salty than anything, but the speck, which the server highly recommended was indeed very tasty (not that he had to try very hard to convince us of anything). The mint tagliatelle was a broad pasta dish that had mint herbs inside the pasta, which gave it a great texture, making the noodles seem handcut. Normally, I don&#8217;t like ordering pasta because I feel that it&#8217;s something I can make at home or that it&#8217;s really inexpensive to buy, but the herbs and lamb with the pine nuts were a nice touch, and the tomatoes were really sweet; everything just went together very well. I only wished that it was served hotter instead of being lukewarm.<br />
We ended our meal by sharing a berry consomme for dessert ($7) &#8211; the iced lemongrass with yogurt and fresh berries (and edible flower petals too) &#8211; also recommended by our server. We wanted something light, and we certainly got that. I was pleasantly surprised that it tasted so good, with the ingredients that looked so (inexpensive and) easy to make. And, we ended dessert with the $1 nookie cookies, a tiny little chocolate cookie that is loaded with an umfph &#8211; tastes like you bit into a brownie that melts in your mouth. Definitely for those who like sweets, but not really for me.<br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aimeili/3593720063/" title="IMG_0022 by b.p., on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3639/3593720063_ca88d649db_m.jpg" width="200" height="115" alt="IMG_0022" /></a><br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aimeili/3593720499/" title="IMG_0036 by b.p., on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3658/3593720499_6551fe82ac_m.jpg" width="200" height="115" alt="IMG_0036" /></a></p>
<h3>Service</h3>
<p>When the server wasn&#8217;t always around to serve us, another staff would be available for our table. The server, David, obviously is well-known in the neighbourhood, as he would walk outside and wave to the people across the street (further research online suggests that maybe he is the manager). He took the time to describe the stuff on the platter and made some pretty good recommendations. I found it a little unconventional that one would wear a hat inside, but maybe it was because it was the beginning of the shift as that was later removed (we came before dinner started). Grace and I thought that he reminded us of a mutual acquaintance we know (Nate T), which got us wondering how he was doing&#8230;</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>I would make a second visit if I&#8217;m ever in this area again but not necessarily as a regular, if only for the pasta alone.		</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				A friend asked me if I had dream job, what would it be? Sadly, I couldn&#8217;t come up with anything, except that if I was to be a mom, I&#8217;d be a good one (and it&#8217;s not like I want kids!).<br />
So I&#8217;ve been thinking that if I had the talent, the time, and the funding, I would like to be a photographer, capturing candid expressions of the moment and making still life come to life. Better yet, combine it with my foodie tendencies and out comes a food critic! Too bad everybody these days are photographers and foodies.<br />
Anyway, onto my recent Toronto adventures&#8230;<br />
Grace and I had two nights to try some local eats around the Yonge/Eglinton area. We were going to try Lime (pan-asian fusion) but after having Spring Rolls at the Yonge and Eglinton location, I had no desire to eat anything like it for awhile (and if that was my first time at Spring Rolls, I would not have gone to any of its other locations &#8211; let&#8217;s just say that the pad thai was unnaturally pink/red).<br />
Our first stop:</p>
<h3><b>Quince</b></h3>
<p>2110 Yonge Street<br />
Toronto, Ontario<br />
416.488.2110<br />
Date of visit: June 1, 2009</p>
<h3>Restaurant</h3>
<p>Quince is a little restaurant on Yonge just beyond the busy strip. They&#8217;re famous for their homemade gnocchi, the quinoa salad and their wood-fire oven. The menu isn&#8217;t too extensive but the food is worth trying, especially if you like gnocchi (I think Grace will now compare gnocchi everywhere else against this).<br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aimeili/3593719153/" title="IMG_0001 by b.p., on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2441/3593719153_7916e7d7f2_m.jpg" width="178" height="240" alt="IMG_0001" /></a> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aimeili/3594527994/" title="IMG_0014 by b.p., on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3559/3594527994_322bc4f2ab_m.jpg" width="188" height="240" alt="IMG_0014" /></a></p>
<h3>Meal Choice, Food Quality</h3>
<p>A basket of bread is served as a complimentary starter, with a hummus style dip (with cilantro and what tasted like cumin). Both the gnocchi and the wood-oven chicken dishes were under $20, and portion sizes are reasonable. I&#8217;m always wary of ordering pork and/or chicken as sometimes, the middles are dry, bland, or both. Surprisingly, despite the size of the chicken, the white meat wasn&#8217;t dry (though it was less flavourful than the dark meat); I enjoyed the seasoning and did not find it too salty.<br />
We completed our meal with a warm apple tart tatin and a iced passion fruit mousse ($8 each). However, I found that because the mousse was iced, it kind of tasted like ice cream, and the dark chocolate was slightly overpowering the passion fruit taste.<br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aimeili/3593719523/" title="IMG_0011 by b.p., on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3622/3593719523_d07048f188_m.jpg" width="200" height="150" alt="IMG_0011" /></a><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aimeili/3593719421/" title="IMG_0008 by b.p., on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2445/3593719421_1cdfe477a4_m.jpg" width="200" height="150" alt="IMG_0008" /></a></p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Their sample Summerlicious menu looks appetizing and I&#8217;m glad we tried this place over Lime, but if I was to pick to visit a restaurant in this area again, I&#8217;d choose Le Gourmand (LG3) for their uniqueness in food choice instead &#8211; our next adventure.		</p>

<p>I live with a celebrity. It seems that a plethora of people know PT, even though he doesn&#8217;t know or recognize them. We witnessed an instance where someone just walked up to the car window and asked him if he was PT. Turns out, it was Lue&#8217;s father; her brother had recognized him.</p>
<p>He seems to be well connected with people in Kingston too. The people there are very hospitable. The church itself reminds me of KWCAC &#8211; much of the demographics of the English congregation seems to be mostly young adults &#8211; mostly students; few young adults who are working full-time. And, like KWCAC, few are around for the Labour Day long weekend.</p>

<p>Every time I go to Montreal/QC or another city/country that speaks another language, I find that I really want to learn that language. But sadly, by the time I return home, and back to the routine, that desire disappears. I&#8217;m not sure where the appeal and attraction lies, but maybe that explains why I generally enjoyed learning Chinese despite the homework, tests, and Saturday classes.</p>
