I had the opportunity to attend <a href="http://www.blnd.ca/#schedule" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BLND</a>, this one-day, full-day UX event (conference) that was entirely <em>free</em> (even the food was free, and the optional bus from/to UW)! By the end of it, I went home impressed at the quality of the talks, the workshops, and the flow of how they managed to jam-pack a day&#8217;s worth of material. This was also the first event where I felt that there was a good mix of community professionals and students, and  got to hear from various people on how they got onto the UX path. I&#8217;ve come to conclude that no one journey is the same, and reflecting back, mine seems just as accidental[ref]but we all know that nothing in life is accidental, and I don&#8217;t believe in coincidences[/ref] as the many who shared their stories[ref]My story? Two English courses in my program piqued my interest, then interactions with those at work, options to either go UX or PM route, and then to research or design route[/ref]. Though, the path can be so much more directed as a student these days, as there are a multitude of programs in this field!<br />
The workshop I chose to attend covered many tips that would have been quite useful in the large corporate environment where I spent a number of years at as a UX person[ref]at a time where UX roles were relatively new and where job titles weren&#8217;t standard across the company or industry convention, so getting HR to recognize that what I did was on par with other peers in the org was only possible with a supportive manager[/ref], and it was a great complement to the keynote talk which reminded us to embrace &#8220;the villains&#8221; (the naysayers or skeptics). I&#8217;m jotting down the condensed / key notes here as I promised to exchange notes with those who went to the others.</p>
<h2>The Art of Stakeholdering</h2>
<p>Workshop by Chelsea Omel (TELUS), Patrick Bach (TD), Markus Grupp (Indigo) &#8211; all formerly at TELUS&#8217; design team focusing on consumer products<br />
Google found me <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/SDNCanada/a-crash-course-in-the-art-of-stakeholdering-patrick-bach-chelsea-omel-markus-grupp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the slides</a>! [ref]it would also appear that 3 of these talks at the other event were given here as well; here is <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/SDNCanada/scaling-service-design-christine-zoltok" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the third</a>. Guess it&#8217;s no surprise that one of the planners of the SDNCanada event was the event organizer for BLND[/ref]<br />
<strong>Stakeholder:</strong> one who has a stake in the enterprise, and involved in or affected by a course of action, who is going to be impacted by what you&#8217;re putting out. The majority of people will not be the perfect stakeholder.<br />
Always remember: it&#8217;s a two-way relationship.</p>
<h3>Steps</h3>

<li>
<h3>Know your actor(s)</h3>
<ul>
<li>their knowledge of design, their belief in design, and<br />

their level of influence &#8211; keeping in mind that driving change or adoption from top-down is much easier than from bottom-up</li>
<li>could fall into one of four quadrants / types:
<ol>
<li><strong>prospect</strong> &#8211; low belief, low in understanding of design</li>
<li><strong>skeptic</strong> &#8211; low belief, high in understanding; may become an obstacle or distraction, being a disruption in meetings, and might even rub off on others and lower the energy</li>
<li><strong>eager beaver</strong> &#8211;  low in understanding but high in belief</li>
<li><strong>champion</strong> &#8211; high in understanding and in belief in design</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>understand their background or need</li>
<li>building empathy with stakeholders is vital</li>

</ul>
</li>

<h3>Write the script</h3>
<ul>
<li>language is important: adopt the language of the people / of the organization</li>
<li>Find out what the words mean; define your context</li>
<li>understand your stakeholders;<strong> understand their</strong> <strong>mental models</strong>:<br />
<figure id="attachment_5613" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5613" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="wp-image-5613 size-medium" src="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/wp-1489207063805-e1489210708695-300x65.jpg" alt="notebook notes" width="300" height="65" srcset="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/wp-1489207063805-e1489210708695-300x65.jpg 300w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/wp-1489207063805-e1489210708695-768x167.jpg 768w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/wp-1489207063805-e1489210708695-1024x223.jpg 1024w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/wp-1489207063805-e1489210708695.jpg 1538w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-5613" class="wp-caption-text">Another example above: these are equally valid concepts for the idea of a &#8220;merger&#8221;</figcaption></figure><br />
e.g. the word &#8220;research&#8221; could have different meanings for many people (&#8220;market research&#8221;, &#8220;academically&#8221;, qualitative vs quantitative);<br />
there is a risk of miscommunication when one person has a different mental model than another;<br />
physical mental models (e.g. a house) are easier to illustrate than service experience mental models (e.g. getting your morning coffee/tea)</li>
<li><strong>Group icebreaker idea:</strong> sketch the steps on how each of them would make a cake; how much detail will one insert into a sketch? this helps you to gain insight on what they value and surface assumptions &#8211; where people are at, what they are thinking</li>
<li>Reminder: you might get buy-in into the process, not necessarily into the product / idea, and that could still be considered a &#8220;win&#8221;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Set the stage</h3>
<ul>
<li>adapt activities to <em>who</em> is in the room,</li>
<li>workshops: to get people on the same page<br />
types:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>showing:</strong> for skeptics, prospects; high-production in quality, simple</li>
<li><strong>learning:</strong> for prospect, eager beavers; e.g. Design 101; case-studies, templates, examples to work through together, coaching opportunities such as journey maps, empathy maps</li>
<li><strong>working: </strong>for champions, eager beavers; have clear objectives, advanced tools, and less prep work is usually necessary; the dream state</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Remember: [embrace failures] sometimes failures can lead to success!</p>
<blockquote><p>Mastering the art of stakeholdering is what sets you apart</p></blockquote>
<p>Me: In other words, if I was to assign &#8220;competency&#8221; categories to it (according to HR report cards when it comes to self-assessments and performance reviews), this would be key under influence and persuasion.		</p>
