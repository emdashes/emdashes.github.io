								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				When I <a href="http://her.happyhippos.ca/2017/07/first-solo-trip-with-two/">went to Vancouver last year with two little ones</a>, I wanted to minimize the amount of gear I needed to carry. Thankfully my sister&#8217;s kids are the same size, so I was able to limit my luggage to just a carry-on suitcase, a backpack (with snacks and activities), one car seat, and a diaper bag. I didn&#8217;t have to take a car seat with me, but I decided that having one on board would be safer and better overall, so I had to find a way to lug it without needing to carry it.</p>
<h2>The suitcase stroller</h2>
<p>I looked online for ideas, and saw a couple of products to help mitigate this problem &#8211; one was a foldable trolley where you put the car seat (and child in) and the other was a strap that looked like a T where it attached the car seat to a carry-on suitcase. Well, I didn&#8217;t want to buy anything that was only useful in this situation or bring along anything extra (like the trolley), so I tried to use what I had to mimic the T-strap. A mom in a local mom&#8217;s Facebook group asked me to post some screens of my setup when she saw a photo of what I did, and j.w wanted to record a video of it, so he did a wonderful job of capturing my explanation, Bean and all:<br />
<iframe title="Suitcase stroller" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zbpq4FggdOs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe><br />
For those who don&#8217;t want to watch the unedited video, read on for some written instructions.</p>
<h3>Materials</h3>
<p><figure id="attachment_6504" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-6504" style="width: 225px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="wp-image-6504 size-medium" src="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/DSC_0154-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300" srcset="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/DSC_0154-225x300.jpg 225w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/DSC_0154-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/DSC_0154-1568x2091.jpg 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-6504" class="wp-caption-text">What you need before connecting everything together</figcaption></figure><br />
This is what I used &#8211; and what you might need:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>An adjustable luggage strap</b>. You might be able to get away without this if the LATCH straps on your car seat are long enough to wrap around to the back of the suitcase; mine cannot. It seems that Asian families back in the day were known to wrap their suitcases with luggage straps (to keep it together and to see it easier on the carousel, maybe?), so it was quite easy for me to find one lying around. I like this particular one because there is a loop in it that the carabiner clips in so it&#8217;s snug and it doesn&#8217;t move. I&#8217;ve also used a bungee cord in a pinch, when I left my luggage strap behind &#8211; but I didn&#8217;t feel it was safe to put a child in it then.</li>
<li><b>One carabiner</b>. If it&#8217;s weight supported (such as ones meant for climbing), it&#8217;s probably safer; mine&#8217;s not.</li>
<li><b>A key ring</b>, O-ring, or D-ring. You might be able to get away without this if the top tether can clip to the carabiner, but I find it much easier with it. Probably safer if it&#8217;s weight-tested as well. If you get rid of your luggage strap, you would need this so that the LATCH clips can clip/hook onto the ring.</li>
</ul>
<h3>The setup</h3>
<p><figure id="attachment_6503" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-6503" style="width: 225px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="wp-image-6503 size-medium" src="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/DSC_0159-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300" srcset="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/DSC_0159-225x300.jpg 225w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/DSC_0159-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/DSC_0159-1568x2091.jpg 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-6503" class="wp-caption-text">A closer look at what it looks like after everything is connected together</figcaption></figure><br />
A three-step summary:</p>
<ol>
<li>Match the back of the car seat against the front of the carry-on suitcase when vertically standing</li>
<li>Thread the luggage strap through the car seat where the seat belt would go for a forward-facing set up, and adjust so that car seat is snug against the suitcase. If there are handles on your suitcase, put the luggage strap through them (the video shows the straps are twisted &#8211; try to make sure they&#8217;re flat before continuing).</li>
<li>Take the top tether of the car seat and thread it through the handles on top of the suitcase and the handle bar (I pull up the handlebar to make it easier), and hook and clip the tether to the ring, or the carabiner, if you don&#8217;t use a ring. Tighten, tilt, and test it out.</li>
</ol>
<p>With the car seat strapped to the carry-on suitcase, I could either put all my stuff into the seat while Bean helped roll it, or she sat in it and helped hold some stuff, while I wore my 18 month old in a carrier. People looked our way, but I&#8217;m not sure if it&#8217;s because people haven&#8217;t seen others do this, and/or they were thinking what kind of crazy parent would do that. On Air Canada (Dreamliner specifically), I can roll this contraption down the aisle and get to my seat without undoing anything, but it does not fit down the aisle on WestJet or Air Canada Rouge planes &#8211; some will fit down business class but once you get to economy, you will quickly find out it doesn&#8217;t fit so it&#8217;s better just to undo it in the area where parents gate check their strollers and car seats. You will also need to buffer a little more time to take it apart and put it together again as you go through security screening.<br />
Happy travelling!		</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				I was once a Bath&amp;Body Works fan: I stocked up on their antibacterial foaming hand soap anytime they had a sale (anything for $3 or less for a bottle was considered a deal) because they smelled nice and looked fancy; I also didn&#8217;t have to pump a lot of soap to get a nice clean feeling on my hands. And yet, each bottle became recycled waste every time it emptied because one soap pump on sale was cheaper than a bottle of soap refill.<br />
Then, I became a parent.<br />
I read about how triclosan, an ingredient in these antibacterial soaps aren&#8217;t the best choice for little hands, because they kill everything along with other questionable things that are associated with it. It seems like <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2016/09/02/492394717/fda-bans-19-chemicals-used-in-antibacterial-soaps">they&#8217;ve banned this ingredient now, at least in US</a>, which is a good start, and that Bath &amp; Body Works has &#8220;gentle foaming hand soap&#8221; now in its place. And, I started to shift towards more natural products, preferring unscented or <a href="http://her.happyhippos.ca/2017/01/essential-oils-when-less-is-more/">scented with essential oils</a> over added (synthetic) fragrance or parfums.<br />
Eventually, I quit buying from Bath &amp; Body Works and saved the last few bottles once they were empties and have used my own foaming soap since, which is probably a more frugal and more environmentally-friendly alternative. [ref] Glass or stainless steel dispensers is probably best, but I&#8217;ve used plastic without any problems so far (I did toss one when something looked off).[/ref] Interested in making your own?</p>
<h3>Easy as 1-2-3:</h3>
<p>You can follow the many recipes on Google but here&#8217;s my version:</p>
<ol>
<li><b>Get some liquid castile soap</b> (<a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/14-uses-for-dr-bronners-soaps-2013-11">like Dr. Bronner&#8217;s</a>) &#8211; the just-under 1L bottles of castile concentrate go on sale sometimes for under $15. If you want, you can buy unscented or scented and skip adding fragrance in later. [ref] just be careful that you don&#8217;t get any of it undiluted in your eye or your face, especially the peppermint one, as it is super concentrated and your eyes will burn and your skin will tingle for a long while &#8211; trust me on this one, I know from experience[/ref]</li>
<li><b>Add some soap</b> into an empty foaming dispenser</li>
<li><b>Add water</b> &#8211;  I do 1/4 or less of soap and the rest with water. You can experiment with a ratio you like by washing your hands and feeling how clean it is after.</li>
</ol>
<p><b>Pro tip:</b> I don&#8217;t actually fill up the entire bottle; I rather make the foaming soap solution more frequently to lower chances of having any bacterial growth / residue in a bottle that sits unused. Note that if it sits in a cool area, it may cloud over, which is fine.</p>
<h4>Optional:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Use distilled water instead of tap, as I&#8217;ve read that it may keep bacteria and floaties (precipitate as my friend calls it) at bay. I&#8217;ve just used filtered and haven&#8217;t run into any trouble since I switched from tap.</li>
<li>For your own custom blend or to add a nice scent, add only <a href="http://her.happyhippos.ca/2017/01/essential-oils-when-less-is-more/">a </a><b><a href="http://her.happyhippos.ca/2017/01/essential-oils-when-less-is-more/">few</a></b><a href="http://her.happyhippos.ca/2017/01/essential-oils-when-less-is-more/"> drops of essential oils</a> (do you research and avoid the ones that may have a risk if you have little ones in your household: rosemary, peppermint, eucalyptus are at the top of my mind to avoid); sweet orange (be careful as acid may react with plastic in the bottles; I haven&#8217;t had that problem) and lavender may be good choices to start.</li>
<li>Add a few drops of Vitamin E for moisturizing and to possibly help with extending its shelf life, but Dr. Bronner&#8217;s has tocopherol as an ingredient which some labels will also say Vitamin E as a preservative.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
On the featured image: Since I don&#8217;t have time to make my bottles fancy with custom labels to show off, perhaps a DIY faucet extender hack will go well with DIY foaming soap? <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f61b.png" alt="😛" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />		</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				When we were expecting our first, we were graciously lent a BabyBjörn&nbsp;carrier, where the baby could be carried facing out or in. We didn&#8217;t know much about babywearing, and Bean didn&#8217;t really take to the BabyBjörn; I did eventually come across a <a href="https://skeptoid.com/blog/2013/01/25/will-the-babybjorn-endanger-your-infants-health/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">controversial warning</a> to watch out for &#8220;crotch-danglers&#8221; (ie. instead of dangling by their legs, that they&#8217;re supported by a seat or their legs are in a M / froggy style so that they&#8217;re not contributing to <a href="http://www.ikea.com/ca/en/catalog/products/20327709/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hip dysplasia)</a>, so we returned it, since she didn&#8217;t seem to take to it anyway and because I didn&#8217;t want to risk making her <a href="http://hipdysplasia.org/developmental-dysplasia-of-the-hip/infant-signs-and-symptoms/hip-click/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hip-clicks</a> any worse.<br />
Thankfully, that wasn&#8217;t the end of babywearing: a $21 <a href="http://www.mamankangourou.com/en/product/asiatik--mei-tai-type" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hybrid mei dai / stretchy wrap by MamanKangourou</a>&nbsp;seemed to be a good find which ended up working really well for us when she was smaller[ref]minor complaint are the long straps[/ref] &#8211; at that point, I had no idea what the carries were (mei dai / stretchy wrap?) and had never heard of the company, but I enjoyed its coziness / snugglies, the extra neck support, and she enjoyed napping in it especially during Sunday church service, and when she was big enough to fit in a suspected fake[ref]which the company refused to confirm because it wasn&#8217;t purchased from the retailer vs. Sophie the Giraffe&#8217;s company who confirmed that a hand-me-down one was old, but authentic[/ref] ergo hand-me-down without the infant insert, she liked to be carried in that as well &#8211; even into toddlerhood. A friend allow loaned us a linen Sakura Bloom ring sling, but I didn&#8217;t have the heart to use it all that much because of its cost!<br />
Baby #2 might have been neglected in some things for better or worse (#secondbaby), but this time around, I looked into getting a ring sling that wasn&#8217;t crazy expensive and found one on Etsy for $40 after not being able to source any local handmade ones. When it came, it wasn&#8217;t as soft as I expected so it was harder to adjust, but with the help of my chiropractor, she showed me how to use it so that it&#8217;s comfortable for baby or toddler and me; maybe it wasn&#8217;t broken in yet, but now I know that the sling is probably made of duck cloth (one-sided print).<br />
Enter the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/DIYBabywearing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DIY Babywearing</a> Facebook group. I don&#8217;t know how I ended up on there, but I&#8217;ve learned a lot from this community, with one successfully completed project: an Ikea <a href="http://www.ikea.com/ca/en/catalog/products/20327709/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stilfull</a> tablecloth converted to two soft no-sew (but hemmed) ring slings! Had I known about how easy and inexpensive it is to make your own wrap/carrier, I would have done it from the start, and used $15 instead of paying $40 for one. I&#8217;m likely at a <a href="http://wiki.babywearingdiy.com/do/view/Main/WrapCarries" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">base size 5</a> so I can use the Stilfull tablecloth length for size 2 carries and under when I don&#8217;t want to use the rings, including the following front/hip carries:<br />

<p>By the way, I got my weight-tested rings from <a href="http://babywearings.ca" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">babywearings.ca</a>, a partnered Canadian reseller of <a href="http://slingrings.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">slingrings.com</a>, which is pretty much the go-to place to get babywearing rings. They&#8217;re good because of their weight and because they aren&#8217;t welded together so they won&#8217;t risk tearing the fabric or irritating the baby &#8211; my baby used to like gnawing at the rings or sleeping against them. <strong>Currently, they have a 40% off sale too (Code: NovaScotia)</strong>, so it could be anywhere from $4.2 &#8211; $6 for a pair! I found the large rings made the Stilfull fabric easier to adjust, but also less grippy, so a pair of medium rings would probably work better once you&#8217;re used to how it feels.		</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				The local libraries here aren&#8217;t your typical traditional ones; sure you can borrow books, but they offer so much more. In addition to having resources like a media centre with a 3D printer and VR games, library patrons can borrow video games, toys, museum passes, and even internet hotspots; they also offer some really interesting programs for different age groups. I&#8217;m no stranger to circle time with wee ones, crafting terrariums, breaking out from a mini-escape-room, <a href="http://her.happyhippos.ca/2015/05/coffee-notes/">learning about </a>coffee, or watching new DVD releases in the library&#8217;s little theatre; everything is at and hosted by the library, and the best part is that they are all free! I sometimes wish I had more time or the waitlist to some of these weren&#8217;t so long (like the upcoming social paint nite and refreshments) [ref] this one filled up within 10 mins of open-registration[/ref])!<br />
<span style="font-size: 16px;"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-5592" src="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_20170123_194337-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="739" height="554" srcset="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_20170123_194337-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_20170123_194337-300x225.jpg 300w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_20170123_194337-768x576.jpg 768w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_20170123_194337.jpg 1447w" sizes="(max-width: 739px) 100vw, 739px" />The other night, Ryan Horne from </span><a style="font-size: 16px;" href="https://www.facebook.com/foragergreens/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@ForagerGreens</a><span style="font-size: 16px;"> graciously gave a workshop at the library on how to make kombucha, offered samples of some of his kombucha, and brought everyone a container of starter brew + SCOBY (ready to be added to freshly brewed sweet tea). At the workshop, we found that he sells the starter kit for $20, so we just saved ourselves $20 &#8211; though it&#8217;s really the SCOBY that we&#8217;re after, as everything else we can easily source! Like </span><a style="font-size: 16px;" href="http://her.happyhippos.ca/2014/01/kefir-and-breast-milk/">the kefir</a><span style="font-size: 16px;"> that j.w now makes and drinks (whereby Bean happily drinks plain and gulps down the whey as if it was juice), all one needs is the active ingredient (Kefir &#8211; grains; Kombucha &#8211; SCOBY), and you&#8217;re good to go for awhile.</span><br />
I don&#8217;t know how my first batch will turn out; it&#8217;s sitting on another counter away from the kefir. If it&#8217;s doing what it&#8217;s supposed to be doing, the tea <del>will turn</del> is turning lighter, almost to a golden hue, as the week progresses, and a new layer of SCOBY <del>will be formed</del> is forming on top. Unlike kefir where you see a distinct separation of the &#8220;curds&#8221; and whey, there seems to be no obvious visual indicator, other than the color and that the SCOBY has formed a layer across / seal &#8211; and only if you&#8217;re paying attention. However, the final indication of both is the taste-test; if you like it, it&#8217;s ready.<br />
Before my notes get all wrinkled and smudged, here&#8217;s what to know about kombucha:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kombucha" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">kombucha</a>, Japanese in origin to mean &#8220;kelp tea&#8221; [ref]makes sense to me, since the stringy yeast on the SCOBY reminds me of kelp / seaweed at times[/ref], now it means fermented (sweet) tea. If you buy a commercial bottle in stores, you could spend anywhere from 3$ to 6$! Essentially, it&#8217;s made up of starter brew+SCOBY+brewed sweet tea.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Starter Brew</h2>
<p>Fully brewed kombucha should smell like vinegar (or a faint smell if it&#8217;s not too strong), and a formula for starter brew comprises of: 1-2 cups of full brewed kombucha (the starter liquid) + SCOBY that is at least 1/8 inch thick (5oz) and should cover at least 1/2 of the surface area / opening of the jar/container/vessel, which is added to 1 gallon brewed tea; the more SCOBY you have, the more likely you will succeed. If you don&#8217;t have starter liquid, you can substitute it for a 1/4 cup of distilled vinegar.</p>
<h2>SCOBY</h2>
<p>What&#8217;s a SCOBY? It stands for Symbiotic Culture of Bacteria and Yeast.</p>
<ul>
<li>A healthy one can look like a thin puck and it&#8217;s not unusual to see spits, holes, strands, floaties and strings of yeast[ref]edible, but most people filter it out[/ref]. When you pick it up, it should stay together and shouldn&#8217;t tear easily. A new SCOBY is beige, creamy in colour; the underside will likely look more weird than the top side, and colours of blue or purple aren&#8217;t unusual; it might sink, and that&#8217;s okay. If your container is too small for the SCOBY, it is safe to cut it up.</li>
<li>An older SCOBY can turn brown, work slower or stop working, but you can just keep it there in the batch. However, if you see mold on it, just scrap it and start new.   Signs of mold include powdery, dry splotches, specks in black, blue, or white; people have compared it to mold on an orange or a piece of bread.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Brew Environment and Equipment</h2>
<ul>
<li>Making an ideal brew: it thrives in 73-85F temperature, out of direct sunlight and avoid an exterior wall if possible. Don&#8217;t fill the container too full: leave some breathing space at the top of the container for the ecosystem to work; it also needs a &#8220;lid&#8221; that breathes such as a paper coffee filter, dish towel, or a piece of paper towel.</li>
<li>Food-grade plastic, glass, or stainless steel is okay, despite what online research may say</li>
</ul>
<h2>Brewing Sweet Tea</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<h3>Water</h3>
<ul>
<li>Must be chlorine-free, clean, potable</li>
<li>Avoid minerals &#8211; hard water can slow it down or kill it so if you&#8217;re using tap, boil it first and then let it sit overnight; then reboil it for tea</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Sugar</h3>
<ul>
<li>1 cup sugar per 4L / 1 gallon of tea / kombucha. Don&#8217;t worry, 50-80% of the sugar gets converted</li>
<li>White is good; evaporated cane juice crystals is the best choice. A bag of Kirkland organic cane sugar is supposedly only $4!</li>
<li>If you decided to use honey, he recommends that you get the pasteurized kind because the raw, unpasteurized kind contains anti-bacterial properties, thus may kill it[ref]Jun, is a honey-based kombucha, and <a href="http://www.kombuchabrooklyn.com/blog/jun-honey-based-kombucha/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">using raw honey</a> seems to yield success[/ref]. Honey will result in a faster brew; same with maple syrup, so use less if you use either kind.</li>
<li>Do not use artificial or plant sugar (e.g. stevia, agave), as it won&#8217;t work</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Tea</h3>
<ul>
<li>Black tea is the best; use bagged or loose</li>
<li>Avoid flavoured or herbal teas; any natural oils in them can kill the SCOBY (makes sense since some <a href="http://her.happyhippos.ca/2017/01/essential-oils-when-less-is-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">essential oils</a> have anti-fungal, anti-bacterial properties)</li>
<li>Should just stay &#8220;tea&#8221; in the ingredients; decaf is okay</li>
<li>Boil 4-5 bags of tea in a 2 gallon pot of water for 15+ minutes; cool it down to lower than body temperature before adding it to the starter brew</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Ready State</h2>
<ul>
<li>Is the kombucha ready to drink? You can use a straw (and a finger to suck up some tea) for the taste test, or more scientifically, you can also use PH strips to check for the ideal 3.5 PH; a PH of 4.0 is indicative of a new batch, &lt;3.0 is more potent. For a 2 gallon batch, it will start stating like apple cider vinegar around Day 5, and generally, a batch would be ready in about 7-10 days. If you want to slow the process down, you can put the whole thing in the fridge. You can pour it out in a batch and leave some starter brew (batch brew), or add a new batch of freshly brewed tea to the container (continuous brew)</li>
<li>When it&#8217;s ready, you can do a secondary fermentation, where you add 10-20% of fruit or other flavours in a bottle of ready kombucha, such as ginger or pear, with or without pulp. Leave it in room temperature for 1-5 days. Sealed will make more carbonation (be careful when opening)</li>
<li>You can put it in the fridge to cool it before drinking, or you can drink it straight up.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Clean up</h2>
<p>When washing the jars and other equipment for kombucha, don&#8217;t use antibacterial soap, including on your hand; you can easily use hot water and vinegar to wash and rinse.<br />
ENJOY!		</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				Because in this case, more becomes too much &#8211; for instance, one drop of peppermint essential oil is equivalent to <a href="https://www.google.ca/search?espv=2&amp;q=1+drop+of+peppermint+essential+oils+equivalent+to+28+cups+of+tea&amp;oq=1+drop+of+peppermint+essential+oils+equivalent+to+28+cups+of+tea&amp;gs_l=serp.3...2721.4179.0.4436.3.3.0.0.0.0.99.263.3.3.0....0...1c.1.64.serp..0.0.0.Zs8-hz2zL30" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>28 cups&nbsp;</em>of peppermint tea</a>![ref]though I first read that it was up to 75 bags of peppermint tea![/ref]<br />
In my journey as a mother, it has given me the perfect excuse to move from the mainstream to the more natural (and sometimes more trendy, hip, and thus, expensive) &#8211; away from synthetic dyes, strong-chemical cleaners, parfums and fragrances;&nbsp;now, instead of getting excited for $3 anti-bacterial hand soap from the Bath&amp;Body Works, I get excited over $9 1.1L bottles of Dr. Bronner&#8217;s castile soap, which is pretty much an all-purpose cleaner (for body, face, hands, counters, floors and sinks!). And, I can use a few drops of essential oils to scent it to my fancy &#8211; plus, certain essential oils are said to contain active anti-bacterial, anti-fungal properties, which, if true, then bonus!</p>
<h2>Beginning with Essential Oils</h2>
<p><figure style="width: 425px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a title="anti-wrinkle-essential-oils" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/68909241@N07/8756694939/in/photolist-ekNmjX-qSGAAJ-8vEXkh-eaFRRJ-eRjdg1-a1XWoX-79m1GY-79ha7z-oAWCZN-shNHnE-e2GekE-e2Gerw-c6dPw1-c6dQzh-e2AA52-e2AAoH-e2AAbV-yxpQy-djhHry-5nM8nz-diH6ED-enR4oJ-du4hMD-c6dQ6J-jNEXte-mwJpD3-bvfeA8-oUfH18-cSWygw-8vBVVr-bvfeCT-ncFQvr-8vEXcj-cT8D2J-q9iSSx-aviHH7-boYt43-shNBso-qMDNKT-c6dNcA-7Tmt1Z-4vgg87-9YSyvh-6ADu3y-e7gX8o-q9zzAX-wEWXTH-q77UuW-npkeSc-PuyXy" data-flickr-embed="true"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/3/2852/8756694939_220ee70077.jpg" alt="Essential oils dropper" width="425" height="282"/></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">These containers are best to dispense essential oils a drop at a time. Plus, the dark glass keeps them fresher longer. Image credit: Honolulu Media, Creative Commons License on Flickr</figcaption></figure><br />
<script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script><br />
So where does one start? Had I known more about essential oils before buying my first few vials, I probably would&#8217;ve gotten a few less, or one or two different ones. But, with that being said, I ended up with lemon, citronella, sweet orange, rosemary, spearmint, lavender, ylang ylang (a later addition) and tea tree essential oils.<br />
Now, I&#8217;d recommend one or two from each of these <a href="http://www.deancoleman.org/commonoils.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">three categories</a>, especially if you tend to enjoy experimenting&nbsp;and like to use your own blends instead of an essential oil on its own:</p>
<ul>
<li>A &#8220;base&#8221; (grounding) essential oil, such as frankincense, sandalwood, cedarwood &#8211; it looks like I&#8217;m missing this from my collection; I had a broken bottle of frankincense which was lovely while it lasted (during the 1 use).</li>
<li>A &#8220;middle&#8221; essential oil, such as lavender or rosemary &#8211; personally, I find lavender to be more versatile than rosemary[ref]especially since rosemary is not recommended for use around younger children from various sources online.[/ref]</li>
<li>A &#8220;top&#8221; essential oil, such as sweet orange, lemon, grapefruit, peppermint/spearmint, eucalyptus &#8211; the citrus ones are great in cleaning agents, soaps, but use caution in diffusers as they can erode plastic and as they can affect your skin in sunlight / cause a photosensitive reaction when applied topically [ref]Note that various sources online also recommend against using peppermint and eucalyptus essential oils around younger children.[/ref]</li>
</ul>
<h3>! Precautions and safety, especially around children and pregnant women</h3>
<p>I&#8217;m still learning about essential oils so I&#8217;m far from being an&nbsp;expert in this, but as essential oils are&nbsp;known to actively affect our bodies (it&#8217;s not just nice-smelling), I would follow these precautions, especially around children and pregnant/nursing women:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Don&#8217;t eat, don&#8217;t apply</strong>: Essential oils are the most potent when ingested&nbsp;and when applied directly on the body especially without any dilution&nbsp;(e.g. with a carrier oil), aka &#8220;neat&#8221;. I would avoid unless under direction and care from a health practitioner</li>
<li><strong>Rosemary, Eucalyptus, Peppermint</strong>: based on what I&#8217;ve read online, I would lean towards avoiding these three essential oils around younger children (sources explain that&nbsp;it might affect their breathing), and if you do use it, let it dissipate for 2 hours prior to exposing children in the same area. Though, I&#8217;m still wondering about the commercial products that are advertised as being baby safe that contain these ingredients in them, especially eucalyptus in chest and cold rubs, and germ blends for diffusion (maybe their effectiveness is counteracted by all the other ingredients??)!&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Pregnancy:</strong> Avoid the use of essential oils in your first trimester of pregnancy; <a href="https://www.westcoastaromatherapy.com/free-information/articles-archive/life-ppasssages/using-essential-oils-during-pregnancy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">research the safe ones</a> for the latter trimesters and nursing if using. Yes, I had exposure to essential oils in massage oils, foaming hand soap, and in commercially available shampoo and handmade (but not homemade) bar soap while I was pregnant and nursing.</li>
<li>Use the more common essential oils, unless you&#8217;ve researched the others</li>
<li>When in doubt, avoid or look it up&nbsp;online first</li>
<li><strong>use on body&nbsp;&gt; in the air&nbsp;&gt; &nbsp;in cleaning products</strong>: essential oils have a shelf life, so once it starts to degrade, instead of using it say&nbsp;as a component of your massage oil, you can add it to your&nbsp;diffuser or into a cleaning agent (e.g the mop bucket) instead</li>
<li><strong>Less is more:</strong>&nbsp;unless you use a lot, buying a small vial (10ml instead of 15ml) will ensure freshness. Also, one drop goes a long way even when diluted, as your nose will likely tell you. When diffusing, don&#8217;t let the diffuser go for extended periods of time as you just end up wasting its effectiveness; I&#8217;ve read recommendations of 10 minutes at a time for up to 1-2 hours.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can find more <a href="https://naha.org/?/explore-aromatherapy/safety" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">extensive lists of safety considerations</a> online.</p>
<h2>What can I do with essential oils?</h2>
<p>Now that you have a few bottles of essential oils, here are some ideas on what you can do with them:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make your own <a href="https://www.google.ca/search?sourceid=chrome-psyapi2&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=foaming%20hand%20soap%20diy&amp;oq=foaming%20hand%20soap%20diy&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j0l5.3240j0j7" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">foaming hand soap</a></li>
<li>Diffuse them with a diffuser</li>
<li>Add a <a href="http://her.happyhippos.ca/2014/06/diy-household-cleaners/">few drops to vinegar into a spray bottle for a natural household cleaner</a>, or a few drops of (lemon) essential oil directly to a damp sponge</li>
<li>Other ideas include making your own massage oil, <a href="https://www.evernote.com/shard/s313/sh/4a0be947-34b7-4d55-832e-8f2f30665d33/673ad1f143a5f1f17a99539ab46c0859" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">facial cleanser</a>, moisturizer, hair shampoo, sugar or epsom salt hand/body scrub, bubble bath, bum/baby wipes, laundry dryer balls, mosquito repellent &#8211; the possibilities are endless</li>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				My brother once said that I eat &#8220;too healthy&#8221; and that&#8217;s why I can&#8217;t put on any weight, and one of our friends (who either noticed our Nature Clean dish detergent or using vinegar to mop the floor, or some other &#8220;green&#8221; product) asked me if I was always into more &#8220;natural&#8221; products or was that a side result of being pregnant. It seemed to have started from my conscious choice to read ingredient labels and avoid artificial colors and flavors (even though I know &#8220;natural flavors&#8221; isn&#8217;t necessary any better), but now that we do have a baby, I&#8217;m slowly trying switch over to using less chemical and toxin-ladin products as long as it&#8217;s still at a reasonable cost as I&#8217;ve noticed that floor cleaners, dishwasher detergent, and toilet bowl cleaners have especially strong chemical smells. One of the mothers at <a title="Life with a Baby" href="http://www.lifewithababy.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Life With A Baby</a> organized a workshop and taught us how to make 4 cleaning products and generous samples to take home. She highlighted that some essential oils not only help to make your cleaner smell nice, but they have anti-fungal, anti-bacterial, and anti-septic properties which work really well with the cleaning base (like vinegar or baking soda).</p>
