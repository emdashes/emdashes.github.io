				<![CDATA[
<p>Six months ago, our littlest had an IgE blood test: one nurse took his blood, the other stood by in case he needed to pin him down. I covered my son&#8217;s eyes, she took blood; he flinched at the poke, didn&#8217;t move until it was done and when asked by the nurse if it hurt, he answered, &#8220;nope,&#8221; and looked at them as if to say, &#8220;what, is it supposed to hurt?&#8221; Turns out, he did far better than some adults they&#8217;ve seen.</p>


<p>The report came back, and it was negative for milk, which suggested that  his chance of having an anaphylactic / severe allergic reaction to dairy was less than 25%. I was hopeful! After all, he had some accidental encounters with dairy a handful of times without severe reaction, but there&#8217;s the rub &#8211; his skin didn&#8217;t do as well, and reacted with the milk with the skin prick test . And, this is why you can&#8217;t rely on a blood test alone; that&#8217;s why an allergist has to consider the history of and individual (how they&#8217;ve responded to the allergen in the past) with a combination of tells before making a diagnosis.</p>


<p>When he finally weaned this summer, I happily jumped on the dairy bandwagon again &#8211; with a grilled cheese sandwich as the dairy product that I wanted to celebrate with first. Sadly, it was a variant of a jalapeno popper that wasn&#8217;t as satisfying as a grilled cheese would have been. A few weeks later, I noticed that the skin around my neck was starting to get red, patchy, and quite itchy at times; I&#8217;ve only had eczema around my neck once, and it was during my academic years, so I had figured it was stress induced.</p>


<p>Yet, it seemed to get better when I limited my dairy intake, but flared up again when I  threw caution to the wind over the holidays. I suspect it just might be my body responding to the reintroduction to dairy as some foreign matter. The allergist, in brief conversation, asked me if I was allergic to milk as a child. Why yes, I had recently discovered that while I knew my mother didn&#8217;t know I was allergic to milk until much later &#8212; even though I was vomiting after having any, I didn&#8217;t realize that the doctor didn&#8217;t suggest this to her until I was almost 3 years old! (that might explain why I don&#8217;t like milk now, even though I like many other dairy products). </p>


<p>I expect that if a naturopath confirmed my food sensitivities, she might recommend avoiding the foods that trigger an autoimmune response. Yet, the allergist recommended that if it was only a skin response, that I shouldn&#8217;t eliminate it completely, because he had found in his experience that if children cut out the foods in their diet, and then came into exposure with it down the road, the reaction ends up being a lot worse than before. This is what I wanted to hear, I suppose, because that means I can still have dairy &#8211; but perhaps in moderation.  My family doctor suspects it&#8217;s all related to the chronic skin conditions that I have elsewhere on my body, but I suppose one can never really know; all I know is that the skin is just a visible sign that something is awry with your autoimmune system &#8211; it might be your gut, might be something else inside</p>


<p>The allergist has given the green light to proceed with the oral challenge with the littlest next month, but in a hospital setting in case he needs treatment, so here&#8217;s to hoping &#8230;and praying &#8211; God knows what He&#8217;s doing!<br /></p>

<p class="has-drop-cap">When you ask Little Brother how old he is, he holds up two fingers, and confidently says, &#8220;Three!&#8221; While I find myself correcting him almost every time, mathematically, I suppose he isn&#8217;t incorrect.</p>


<p>At the age he is at now, he&#8217;s starting to identify colours (or colors, for my American friends). He knows &#8220;black&#8221; and &#8220;wipe&#8221; (white), and maybe he knows the others too, but when you ask him what shirt he&#8217;s wearing, or what colour Daddy is wearing today, he might respond with &#8220;Thomas!&#8221;, &#8220;Percy!&#8221;, or &#8220;James!&#8221;. Some days, he might mention Emily or Stephen / Rocket too. It just so happens, those are the colours of  Thomas the train and friends; so, I suppose he isn&#8217;t incorrect.</p>


<p class="has-background has-very-light-gray-background-color">I&#8217;ve come to realize that although Bean doesn&#8217;t often show affection towards people, she deeply cares and loves her little brother. This side of her shows when we are trying to threaten him or put him in time out, she pleas that we don&#8217;t carry through (&#8220;I don&#8217;t want him to go to the hospital&#8221; or &#8220;don&#8217;t leave him!&#8221;) or wants to follow him into time out and be with him. So, in case you missed it &#8211; because I almost did: her favourite colour is no longer green, but currently, &#8220;Thomas&#8221;; I think his is James &#8211; because she has designated the red train in our set for him. He likes trains, so now, she does too.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				<![CDATA[This spring has certainly sprung some surprises, some better than others:


<h2>Ralph S. Mouse (the S stands for smart)</h2>


Let&#8217;s begin with a story of the mouse. If you have followed my stories for some years now, you might recall <a href="https://her.happyhippos.ca/2008/04/mouse-in-house/">the story of j.w catching a live mouse with a waste basket</a>. I was hoping it was a one-time incident; instead, I found myself mentioning to j.w that I saw a grey blob scurrying near the baseboard on the kitchen floor as I was chatting with j.wu after small group one night. j.w investigated and found some droppings in the corner of our kitchen floor! We eventually found a few favourite places it liked to hide when we saw signs of it: particularly behind the bookcase in the basement and behind/in the stove; and, I had accidentally discovered where it likely came from: the range hood vent. I only know this because I went into the cupboard above the stove and found the silicon sleeve on our coffee carafe broken. My first thought? How cheap! And then, one of us realized it had been chewed through. Lo and behold, there was a bunch of droppings all over the cupboard, which of course I had missed because of my height. Who knows how long it&#8217;s been living among us!
So, the cat and mouse game began. First, the live traps were placed, but they consistently turned up empty, and there was no sign of a mouse anywhere; it seemed that even the food crumbs from our children&#8217;s messy eating habits were ignored. Until. I found a bun stuck between where the oven vents out into the stove a couple of weeks later. I was baffled at how it got there as I had thrown it out into the green bin bag myself; then I realized that the mouse must have tried to sneak it into its hiding place by going through the oven vents and because the bun was so big, it jammed!! Well, within 24 hours of placing the snap trap that PT recommended, it caught it. And, there hasn&#8217;t been a mouse indoors since.  And now, the little ants have returned (they get into the house every spring for a few weeks until the powder keeps them away); oddly [ref] it&#8217;s odd because she&#8217;s afraid of bugs in general, like spiders [/ref], Bean says she likes them and even have picked up a few to watch them crawl on her hands.


<hr />


<h2>120 km/h wind storm</h2>


If a trees falls in a forest, does it make a sound? It certainly makes a big splash.
Then there was the ice storm and the wind storm, followed by some wicked summer weather (30C plus). The ice storm wasn&#8217;t much of an ice storm compared to the earlier ones, but the wind storm knocked down many trees. I happened to be sitting on the couch looking out into the forest and saw a giant tree fall into the bog &#8211; it was quite the splash. Our loose fascia ripped off and it&#8217;s missing &#8211; but we discovered that it was loose in the first place because annoying wasps had made a nest under it a while back. But, we were the fortunate ones, roofing and other repair companies are at capacity for the next month or so because some other houses had batches of shingles and even the siding at the side of the house stripped off from the wind! I still see big trees on the ground or on wooden fences around the neighbourhoods we drive by.


<hr />


<h2>Team dynamics</h2>


I&#8217;m approaching 6 months, and a new office! Within the last few months, I&#8217;ve discovered some interesting stats about the makeup of our current team; our newest hire will change it but until then:

<hr />


<h2>Nose injuries</h2>


Well, since our mild hand-foot-mouth incident with our little guy (&#8220;diagnosed by Google&#8221; when we noticed that his fingernails were peeling a few weeks following rash symptoms), he&#8217;s had a couple of accidents:


<ol>
    

<li>He fell from the steps onto his nose. Thankfully, it was a superficial injury, so it healed up relatively quickly. Now we can say that they both have fallen down the stairs at the same age (she rolled down a whole flight from what I could tell and sustained carpet burn injuries)</li>


    

<li>A few weeks later, after it healed, he falls from a trike onto the gym floor and on his nose again. His nose was bleeding off and on for a day, so we took him to the doctor before a trip, just to make sure he was okay. Thankfully, he was fine (and no concussions either as they don&#8217;t wear helmets inside)!</li>


</ol>




<hr />


<h2>The better surprises</h2>


Two visits &#8211; the highlights!


<ol>
    

<li>A lovely visit from a friend and her family from Hong Kong, whom I haven&#8217;t seen in a few years <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></li>


    

<li>A last-minute trip to Orlando (again) for almost a week &#8211; a separate post will follow  since we skipped all theme parks this time around!</li>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				<![CDATA[And, I hope it will be our last, and I hope this will the first and last time I have to call 911 for an emergency response. Come to think of it, that was his first time at a hospital too, since he was <a href="http://her.happyhippos.ca/2015/12/its-another-baby/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">born at home</a>.
A couple of evenings ago, our little one had a <a href="http://kidshealth.org/en/parents/febrile.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">febrile seizure</a>. I didn&#8217;t know that was the name of it at the time, but I had two fleeting thoughts: &#8211; what was it that I read about seizures in young children during illness &#8211; was this it or something else? and &#8211; I hope I don&#8217;t have to ask for our hand-me-down baby clothes back. During the episode, I felt so helpless watching his limbs twitch, his eyes roll back repeatedly, and his lips turn blue. Shortly after we laid him down on the floor, during the call with dispatch, the seizure stopped but his eyes looked glassy, his gaze off in the distance; he fell asleep despite us talking to him and he didn&#8217;t even notice his sister jumping to get his attention. I cheered inside every time his chest rose up and then down, confirming that he was still breathing.
And for those wondering:


<h3>What was the ambulance ride like?</h3>


The inside of an ambulance is surprisingly spacious, with ample room to seat at least 5 passengers with seat belts, and there&#8217;s a <a href="http://www.fernoems.com/en/search-results/pedi-mate.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">child-restraint system</a> for ambulance cots! Though, with rather limited windows and with the small view whizzing by when I tried to look out to see whether we were, I found myself getting a bit motion sick. We were the first call on their shift. As the ambulance door closed, I could only offer a weak smile to the neighbour who walked out to see what was going on (I found out later, they asked j.w if everything was okay and invited them over and offered to babysit if needed). If the $45 ambulance bill is not covered by OHIP or extended health, it&#8217;s a fairly reasonable cost: $755 cheaper than having a fire truck come on scene, and $35 cheaper than for one in our area in BC.


<h3>What happened at the hospital?</h3>


We were placed in our own room with a bed to rest on in the acute care department of the emergency ward  &#8211; I guess that&#8217;s one advantage of arriving via ambulance: <a href="http://www.grhosp.on.ca/care/services-departments/emergency/current-emergency-wait" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">you don&#8217;t have to sit in the waiting area</a> and deal with triage directly. His temperature was noted at 38.8C (which isn&#8217;t the highest it&#8217;s been). One of the paramedics instructed me to put him on the bed and wanted me to stand or sit in the chair, but thankfully, the nurses let me pick him up, which calmed him down (and kept him from falling off the bed!). For the most part, he wasn&#8217;t too miserable &#8211; I mean, you&#8217;d feel uncomfortable and probably want to cry too if they poked you, put you in some confining <a href="http://www.piggostat.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">x-ray contraption</a>, and put a catheter in you. The blood work showed low bicarbonate which may be related to his crazy <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f4a9.png" alt="💩" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> episodes in the past couple of days (diarrhea, the doctor thinks), and chest X-rays suggest something viral in the chest, possibly early pneumonia, which might have been from his cold a couple weeks back and could explain the wet cough they overheard. The doctor consulted the pediatrician and decided that no antibiotics were needed at this time since he&#8217;s still himself, for the most part anyway (thankfully because antibiotics can cause a bunch of side effects including yeast infection in the diaper area &#8211; but I&#8217;ve supplemented with probiotics anyway since he had diarrhea). Pee dip test came out clear. Overall, we had a nice mother-son bonding time once I was given the okay to pick him up and hold him.
Despite us having to wait 5 hours for tests and results to come back, and with little updates unless I asked, towards the end of the evening, a nurse held my son while she faced the other way in the washroom so I could relieve my relatively full bladder, and even gave me a sandwich, some juice, and some fruit for us to eat, when I asked where I could buy some food to fill our rather empty stomachs (the little guy promptly fell asleep once he satisfied his hunger)[ref]this episode happened just as we were sitting down to eat dinner so we missed it[/ref].
Towards the later parts of the evening, one distressed and very vocal fellow ended up in the same ward as us. One of the nurses told me that on weekends/Saturdays especially, and during later parts of the night, they often see people who don&#8217;t know where they are, or are elsewhere mentally because they&#8217;re either drunk or on way too much drugs, and sadly, the many of the latter are young people.
PT took us home as it was late by the time we left and j.w had stayed home with Bean. Since then, DS has symptoms of a cold in addition to the fever, which comes and goes.
Overall, I am very pleased with the response rate and care that we received the other night by Grand River hospital and by the paramedics.


<h3>What are we to watch for now?</h3>


The doctor instructed me to bring him back if he had another seizure within 24 hours, if we see him have any difficulty breathing, or if the fever doesn&#8217;t dissipate within 5 days. I was also advised to make a follow-up appointment with our family doctor the next week. If we notice less wet diapers, she suggested 1:1 apple juice to water ratio as a cheaper and tastier but equally effective alternative to pedialyte.


<h3>Will it happen again? Does it affect their development? Will they get epilepsy?</h3>


Sadly, the chances of another febrile seizure happening in the future is 1 in 3 (33%) now that he has had one. Both the internet and the doctor tells me that it&#8217;s fairly common in young children in response to a fever past 38C and it doesn&#8217;t seem to harm them. Our relatively laid-back child now has both allergy and febrile seizure risks (to balance out his easy-going nature?).  His chance of developing epilepsy according to the doctor is double, moving from 1% to 2%, which is still quite low: it won&#8217;t happen 98% of the time.


<h3>What happened before all this started?</h3>


Before the seizure, he seemed like his usual self, though he has seemed sad after every time he soiled his diaper for the past day or so (every one was was poopy) especially when I asked him about it, and he vomited once while crying on the toilet (I thought it was from crying, not from being sick). He hadn&#8217;t quite shaken his cough from a couple weeks back, but it didn&#8217;t seem to bother him and it was only on occasion, so I thought it was just residual coughing. He was maybe a touch warmer than usual, but I&#8217;m usually able to tell if he has a fever just by feel, so I&#8217;m not sure why I didn&#8217;t notice it; it probably didn&#8217;t help that he was wearing a wool cardigan. He woke up from his late nap after being transferred to j.w so I could make dinner, and shortly after j.w put him in the high chair, I heard, &#8220;I think he&#8217;s having a seizure&#8221;. I suggested moving him onto the ground (which the doctor assured me that was the right thing to do), called 911 since it was his first time and we weren&#8217;t sure what to do &#8211; I figured I could use the verbal coaching if I needed to do infant/baby/child CPR. He definitely felt and looked a lot hotter by the time the seizure stopped and woke up crying.


<h3>What to expect if it happens again in your care?</h3>


Start timing it &#8211; it&#8217;s probably going to feel longer than how much time has actually passed. Falling asleep is normal as long as breathing is happening, and as long as he is responsive and &#8220;comes out of it&#8221; within an hour of happening, it&#8217;s really nothing to be concerned about[ref]I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;m going to be concerned every time it happens anyway[/ref]. Put him down on the floor and turn his head to side in case he vomits. If the seizure continues for more than 4 minutes, call 911. If it doesn&#8217;t last for more than 10 minutes, we don&#8217;t need to bring him in to be assessed but since it takes a few minutes for the ambulance to come, preemptively calling them after 4 minutes is okay.  Paramedics advised us to strip him down to diaper to bring down his temperature as well. The pamphlet the hospital gave us also told us not to put him in a bath to bring down his temperature and don&#8217;t put anything in their mouths; they will not swallow their tongue. If he&#8217;s feverish, give him the correct dosage of Tylenol / Advil to avoid peaking over 38C.


<h3>P.S. As usual, God&#8217;s fingerprint was all over this.</h3>


He prepared me for this in two ways:


<ol>
    

<li>I was supposed to be out that evening watching a movie with a friend but because I forgot to arrange the logistics with j.w (dinner, rides, car, etc.) and because the kids were still napping past the time, I missed it.</li>


    

<li>I have been on a long wait list for a LTE WiFi hotspot router from the library. My hold finally came up the day before this happened and j.w managed to pick it up for me. I was thinking, &#8220;I&#8217;m not going anywhere this week, why would I need internet on the go?&#8221; Well, he thought to throw it into my hospital bag as I was rushing out, and thankfully I had it because I wouldn&#8217;t have paid $10 for internet for the 5 hours that we were there. It enabled me to keep family and friends up-to-date, and I was encouraged to learn that so many were praying for us &#8211; and asking if we needed any help! Thank you, as always 🙂</li>


</ol>


I pray we won&#8217;t experience this again, but if it does happen, at least I know what to expect -sort of; I feel one can never be &#8220;ready enough&#8221; to get married, to get pregnant, to have kids, and now to parent, but I know I&#8217;m never alone in this journey.]]&gt;		</p>

<li>studying younger babies</li>


    

<li>shrieking in laughter, especially when his sister eggs him on</li>


    

<li>plunking at keys (computer and piano keyboards)</li>


    

<li>building with Lego and cars (more so than his sister did, but maybe because his sister is more interested in them now)</li>


    

<li>looking at pictures in books, especially when on the toilet (he asks for them by pointing to where they are stored)</li>


    

<li>sneaking up the stairs (while we were unaware), climbing and standing on chairs (probably seeing his sister do that) &#8211; he&#8217;s definitely less cautious than his sister &#8211; maybe a combination of being a boy, a second-child, and his own personality differences</li>


    

<li>helping mommy unload the dishwasher &#8211; cutlery is his forte, though sometimes he will &#8220;help&#8221; unload his cup by doing quality control on it first and pretending to drink from it</li>


    

<li>playing with water, especially when washing his hands</li>


    

<li>toddling around (now that he&#8217;s walking around with a lot more confidence)</li>


</ul>


Month 14 and 15 seemed pretty significant:


<ul>
    

<li>he took his first unassisted steps at around the 14 month mark (2 months sooner than his sister)</li>


    

<li>2 week long cold/flu, where he spat up a couple of times, but it coincided when our house was sick last year as well</li>


    

<li>at his check-up, he weighed in as being on the 25th percentile (5x his sister!), around 50th percent in height, but 70th in head circumference (<em>not my genes!</em>); the doctor did comment that they are actually more interested in head circumference than length since a spike in the head size curve could mean a tumor or something unusual in there</li>


    

<li>figuring out how to drink properly from a sippy cup (and turning it over and tapping liquid from the unsealed ones all over the tray)</li>


    

<li>&#8220;painting&#8221;[ref]using a brush and water to bring color in a magic book[/ref] for the first time</li>


    

<li>mommy feeding him mixed nut butter (no peanuts) with no reaction the first time, but breaking out in hives and redness that required two doses of Benadryl to calm it down &#8211; <em>sigh</em>, more allergens to watch out for.</li>


</ul>


The doctor says that he&#8217;s supposed to say about 20 words by now, but while he&#8217;s not there yet (probably 3-4 words he says independently), his vocabulary seems to have exploded over the past two months. Resignedly, many of them are in English (sigh) as he&#8217;s picking up what his sister often says:


<ul>
    

<li>babbling, with first words at 14 months that seem to be associated with a meaning, but often copied instead of independently said, like &#8220;bao bao&#8221; (bread, but I realize that his meaning actually encompasses all food), &#8220;wow&#8221;, &#8220;POP&#8221; (goes the weasel), <em>mum mum</em> (food, not me) and now it extends to ow, snack, <em>woh woh </em>(dog), <em>mao mao </em>(cat)</li>


    

<li>signing more (food) by tapping all his fingers together, like in a teepee</li>


    

<li><em>nein nein</em>: wants mommy&#8217;s milk (that&#8217;s how he greets me now too, not mama &#8211; I&#8217;ve been reduced to breastmilk, sigh)</li>


    

<li><em>ma ma</em> (paternal grandmother) (15 months) paired with <em>yeh yeh</em> (paternal grandfather), which he had started calling long before <em>ma ma</em></li>


    

<li>using certain actions for certain songs, at certain parts of songs (like lifting his arms &#8220;when they&#8217;re up they&#8217;re up&#8221; for Grand Ol&#8217; Duke of York)</li>


    

<li>plays word games by repeating after you like counting from 1-5, but only saying 1 or 5 repeatedly: him: <em>YUT, </em>me: <em>yee, sam, say, </em>him: <em>NG; </em>sometimes he just says 5 or 1 before we even get there</li>


    

<li>he also understands what you say, like go get the ball, but even when you&#8217;re not talking to him (such as if I said to his sister, go wash your hands, he suddenly decides he wants to be done with his meal too, or I talk about shoes and he goes and grabs some)</li>


</ul>


A bittersweet stage: <em>our little boy is growing up!</em>]]&gt;		</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				<![CDATA[Today marks the end of steamed milk in my coffee, grilled cheese sandwiches, peanut butter pretzels and buttered popcorn, yogurt, ice cream, and other products containing milk, possibly soy, and peanuts in my diet until the end of our breastfeeding days, which&nbsp;might be for another year or more. While I only have to endure it until the end of our breastfeeding time together, our little one might have to watch his diet for the rest of his life - I'm sad for him, but at least he won't have memories of enjoying those, so he may have less cravings for them, and hopefully better self-control (than I do!)[ref]I didn't realize how much I regularly enjoy milk products until now, even though I don't care for milk itself[/ref].&nbsp;
I once suspected that milk might have been the culprit in his&nbsp;bouts of eczema and bloody stools[ref]though the latter might still be as a result of constipation[/ref], when he was known to spit up after every feeding (I would say mild reflux), and experienced three vomiting episodes after eating one serving of rice cereal that contained milk ingredients, but I was in denial; how could it be? My daily diet only consisted of milk in my one cup of espresso - or so I thought; I forgot about the cheese, ice cream, butter, everything else that has milk protein in it. I'm pretty sure I was in denial, so I didn't&nbsp;cut anything in my diet, thinking that it wasn't really an allergy, and like his sister, would outgrow it. Now, after a visit to an allergist and a positive prick/rash/allergy test, it's official: he&nbsp;has a milk and peanut&nbsp;allergy.
So now, our low-maintenance baby has become a high-maintenance one; I guess our "easy" baby was too good to be true. Yet, this news comes at a timely moment in our lives; we're reading through&nbsp;<em>The Power of a Praying Parent</em> by Stormie Omartian (I keep thinking it&#8217;s &#8220;O&#8217;Martian&#8221;), and we just covered a chapter that talks about releasing our children to God, and this is an example of a very much an appropriate moment to follow her model of prayer: that if it&#8217;s in His will and in His time, that our son will outgrow both his allergies; but&nbsp;if not, will be managed well so that no one would ever need to use an epipen on him; but if so, that it is administered successfully and effectively.
I&#8217;m still processing the news, so I didn&#8217;t get a chance to think of and ask the many follow-up questions that have since popped up (stemming from online research and what others have shared with me &#8211; yep, I&#8217;m also one of those internet moms), but here are some questions that people have asked and the answers I have come across:
<strong>Q. Will he outgrow his&nbsp;allergy?
A.&nbsp;</strong><a href="http://aacijournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1710-1492-7-S1-S7#Sec12" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Possibly</a>. Our allergist says that many children outgrow their milk allergy by the age of 5. I just found out&nbsp;that my siblings and I all had milk allergies until we were 1 years old, and our mother experimented by trying to reintroduce milk slowly and over time. However, only 20% of kids outgrow their peanut allergy. Because Bean seemed to have a milder reaction to peanut butter when she was younger, but outgrew it by 2 years old &#8211; which surprised him, the allergist suggested paying for a blood test to see if her brother&nbsp;would qualify for reintroduction of peanuts under clinical supervision; we&#8217;re praying that&nbsp;he&#8217;d be eligible. So, as of now, it is what it is &#8211; will just have to adapt to manage it.
<strong>Q. How severe is his allergy?
A.</strong> At the skin prick test, the one for peanuts was about 5mm, and the one for milk was slightly larger (6mm, maybe?); I think&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15482519" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the size indicates a positive diagnosi</a>s,&nbsp;but I didn&#8217;t think to ask. According to one site,&nbsp;&#8220;<a href="http://www.kidswithfoodallergies.org/page/food-allergy-test-diagnosis-skin-prick-blood.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">no test [&#8230;] can determine severity</a>&#8220;. Nevertheless,&nbsp;we&#8217;ve been advised to keep two epipens with him. While, I don&#8217;t know the criteria for what makes an allergy a risk for anaphylaxis, we have&nbsp;seen <a href="http://aacijournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1710-1492-7-S1-S6#Sec4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">symptoms matching the criteria in Table 3, section 2 (GI and skin symptoms)</a>&nbsp;and <a href="http://aacijournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1710-1492-7-S1-S6#Sec3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">in this table</a>.
The allergist&nbsp;prescribed two injectors (<a href="http://www.kidswithfoodallergies.org/page/newly-diagnosed.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">as does this site</a>), but I think&nbsp;most people I know only carry one. Although he does not meet <a href="http://aacijournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1710-1492-10-40" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the minimum recommended weight of 15 KG (33 LBs)</a>, the allergist still recommended that over a self-administered antidote citing that human / user error is very common. He then used an ultrasound machine to measure the thickness of muscle between the skin and the bone, to make sure that our son&#8217;s thighs is fat enough &#8211; more than 13mm &#8211; <a href="http://aacijournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1710-1492-10-40#Sec2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">so that the injection won&#8217;t hit bone</a> (and bone marrow, which is equivalent to a IV administration and that&#8217;s bad); he was 16mm. Another option is available (TwinJet?) but is supposedly the same dose.
<strong>Q. Is there no other option other than Epipen? What about Benadryl?</strong>
<strong>A. </strong>The allergist and online sources tells me that&nbsp;Benadryl won&#8217;t help with breathing, but it may help reduce other symptoms (e.g. puffy eyes, lips).
<strong>Q. What can he drink instead of milk, to get the fat content and other nutrients that is in whole milk?
A.&nbsp;</strong>My dietician and online sources say that breastmilk is best so to keep breastfeeding for as long as possible. As long as we have the go ahead to eat soy, we can also have soy and coconut milk; there&#8217;s rice and almond milk as well. I&#8217;ve tried hemp milk, and it tastes like grassy straw, which I&#8217;m not a fan of at all. Fortified alternatives provide at least 30% calcium and some fat content, but it doesn&#8217;t completely replace milk&#8217;s benefits; it&#8217;s also a shame that many companies use carrageenan (or xanthan gum, but not as bad) to thicken their drink, and add sea salt to flavour it. I have to remember to continue to supplement him with Vitamin D. For good fat, I will likely have to be more creative, using oils like avocado or olive, and serving more salmon (frozen filet steaks of wild Alaskan salmon is readily available from Kirkland / Costco year-round, works out to be 10$/lb which is reasonable)
<strong>Q. What about formula?
A.&nbsp;</strong>Online sources seem to suggest that if a baby has a milk allergy, baby may have a higher likelihood of developing a soy allergy, so switching to a soy based formula may end up increasing the risk.
<strong>Q. Can he have lactose-free, cheese, or yogurt? What about goat&#8217;s or sheep&#8217;s milk?
A.&nbsp;</strong>Unfortunately, the allergy is to the milk protein, not the lactose. Most people with milk allergy is to cow&#8217;s milk protein, but I&#8217;m not sure if we have the go-ahead to try other kinds of dairy.
I did mention that I had accidentally fed him vegetables cooked in butter a couple of times and failed to see a reaction, to which he was surprised, so as a result, he told me keep to doing it, but don&#8217;t go beyond what I normally would have done. We will likely have to monitor him very, very closely if we do that &#8211; not to mention, we&#8217;ll have to watch&nbsp;him even more closely when we aren&#8217;t the ones providing his meal / food. Though, I wonder if he&nbsp;can tolerate <a href="https://aacijournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1710-1492-8-5#Sec1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">extreme heated milk products</a>&nbsp;&#8211; will have to ask.
<strong>Q. Can he have other nuts?</strong>
A. In theory, yes. Peanuts is technically a legume and not a tree nut (e.g walnut, pecan), but we have to be careful of cross contamination because they may be processed in facility that isn&#8217;t peanut free.
<strong>Q. What about peanut oil?</strong>
<strong>A.</strong> I&#8217;m not sure about this one. Online sources say that pure unrefined peanut oil should be safe, but I need to check with the allergist about this one. Will likely have to avoid though,&nbsp;especially in commercial places, like restaurants &#8211; because can you be sure that it&#8217;s pure and unrefined?
<strong>Q. So, are you a peanut and dairy-free household now?</strong>
<strong>A.</strong> Thankfully, complete elimination measures aren&#8217;t necessary at this time. In fact, the allergist told us specifically not to stop giving our daughter peanut butter! However,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.hamiltonhealthsciences.ca/documents/Patient%20Education/CowMilkProteinAllergyWhatToEatBreastfeeding-trh.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mom will also need to follow a similar elimination diet</a>, which will be a challenge, as she can&#8217;t eat anything from the allium family either (e.g garlic, onions, chives, leeks).
<strong>Q.</strong> <strong>What can I do to help?</strong>
<strong>A.</strong> Pray for us &#8211; I (we) have no idea what I&#8217;m (we&#8217;re) doing. Trying to avoid garlic, onions, etc. is already hard; I&#8217;m also thinking that avoiding dairy will likely be more challenging than peanuts. And, if you eat with us, we especially appreciate that you take our dietary needs into consideration &#8211; understandably, it&#8217;s probably&nbsp;especially hard if you&nbsp;don&#8217;t need to conscientious of it in your everyday life; I&#8217;m sorry for the inconvenience. If you&#8217;re in a similar family situation, I&#8217;m open to hearing advice and your experiences too. Thank you!]]&gt;		</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				<![CDATA[Wow. Having just returned&nbsp;from the Western Caribbean/Florida and trying to write a recap,&nbsp;I come across this post sitting in my draft. It looks like I wrote down some notes, but never finished it, and I'm not sure if I ever will, so let's expand on some memories and post it now.


<hr />
The decision to visit during the summer, during peak&nbsp;travel period wasn&#8217;t on the table but we did&nbsp;have vague plans to visit sometime to meet my sister&#8217;s baby&nbsp;and for the rest of my family to meet ours. As it turned out, my aunt was getting remarried and invited everyone to their banquet reception and the timing worked, so we redeemed aeroplan points for one way, and bought tickets back after school started so the prices were much better[ref]thankfully, we didn&#8217;t have to modify travel plans as&nbsp;some extended family members had[/ref]. &nbsp;At the wedding is where I get a 3-minute lesson from a cousin on whiskey-tasting 101: taking a sip straight up, then sucking in one breath of air after a sip, and finally with 1 drop of ice in the shot before taking a sip &#8211; each one delivering a different profile / depth.
We all managed to get through the plane rides without too many tears. Bean sat in a car seat, which&nbsp;I much preferred her to be in than in a seat with just a lap belt; the height also allowed her to look out the window. She was happy to watch TV in silence (but no naps), and on the way back, we survived without having a seat back entertainment system &#8211; it also seems that the flight from YXX-Abbotsford is shorter by an hour! The baby was sure different from when Bean was his age &#8211; I couldn&#8217;t nurse him to sleep and keep him asleep; j.w&nbsp;had to help / intervene.

[caption id="attachment_5396" align="alignright" width="300"]<img class="size-medium wp-image-5396" src="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/IMG_20160825_101153-2-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" srcset="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/IMG_20160825_101153-2-300x225.jpg 300w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/IMG_20160825_101153-2-768x576.jpg 768w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/IMG_20160825_101153-2-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/IMG_20160825_101153-2-1568x1175.jpg 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /> She learned a new skill with a new friend, meanwhile picking up some phrases her friend used,&nbsp;and coming home wanting a haircut like her friend.[/caption]
Warm sunny weather welcomed us at the start of our vacation, which made the trip to the&nbsp;Sea to Sky Summit very worthwhile, as it was warm and skies were clear so you could see the views&nbsp;without having to hike up the Chief&nbsp;(photo: that&#8217;s neither me nor Bean). We then visited (enriched and encouraged by) our friends in Woodinville, as we traditionally do every time we&#8217;re out there, and every time, we&#8217;re reluctant to leave.
Alas, the warm weather did not last, but held up enough so that when my dad&#8217;s car had a flat tire followed by a dead battery, I could take the baby out to the side of the road and wait &nbsp;&#8211; though we discovered that more people stopped because they saw me and the baby than when it was just j.w alone. And we all got sick, to the point where Bean developed hives and passed it to her cousin, and where I coughed so much coughed so much that the whole campsite heard me moan (dying cow?) in my sleep. We chickened out on the first day we were to set up camp (as it was damp and soggy and wouldn&#8217;t have helped my cold), and ended up joining our friends for 2 nights&nbsp;instead of 3. As it happens, we don&#8217;t generally hang out with too many families with young kids especially not all at once, so it took some time to get used to every child calling &#8220;mama, mama&#8221; and not wonder if it was Bean.
[caption id="attachment_5393" align="alignleft" width="739"]<img class="wp-image-5393 size-large" src="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/IMG_20160903_193553_hdr-1024x768.jpg" width="739" height="554" srcset="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/IMG_20160903_193553_hdr-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/IMG_20160903_193553_hdr-300x225.jpg 300w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/IMG_20160903_193553_hdr-768x576.jpg 768w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/IMG_20160903_193553_hdr-1568x1175.jpg 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 739px) 100vw, 739px" /> Car camping in cold and damp weather is worth it when the warm sun finally comes out (or sets in this case).[/caption]
Bean and her cousin had a blast together, despite some tears throughout. We ended up staying at their place for the duration of our trip, so that the cousins could spend extended time together, and because my mom didn&#8217;t want our sickly germs prior to their cruise trip two weeks later [ref]to the point where I think I only saw her 3 times during our entire 3 weeks there &#8211; she probably figured she&#8217;d see us upon the end of their cruise anyway[/ref]. We visited the PNE &#8211; I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve been there since high school (the year I entered in some art contest, where my friend, Marie won!- and I took honourable mention). Since it poured, we stayed covered in the farm / agriculture area, where the kids get to go through stations and collect a treat at the end. I discovered that Bean was either afraid or didn&#8217;t like the (plastic) fish in her bucket as she would bury it at the bottom or not want to touch anything touching it.&nbsp;A momma pig looked happy nursing her many piglets, which made me think of the bond&nbsp;between breastfeeding mothers and babies and how it seemingly universal it is (though I wonder if they get latch problems too).
Whether coincidentally or not, it seems that&nbsp;every time we visit my &#8220;home&#8221; church, major leadership changes happen: a pastor resigns or a new pastor comes on board; this time, they introduced a Chinese pastor &nbsp;and another&nbsp;English pastor announced his leave. In spite of the news, we both felt refreshed, as we were actually able to sit and listen to two sermons in a row, in its entirety without being interrupted by a baby (in the nursery) or a toddler (with her cousin and/or my sister in the toddler program). Furthermore, it was a series on marriage; a rare sermon topic at our church, likely because our demographics is mainly students. I don&#8217;t remember what it was about, except that we don&#8217;t pray as a married couple enough &#8211; but I&#8217;m guilty of not spending enough time with God one-on-one, so that would be a good place to start.&nbsp;
During our visit, j.w started 3 months of parental leave; I was elated[ref]While it would have been incredible had he chosen to taken all 37 weeks &#8211; after all, it&#8217;s not often that one gets such an opportunity&nbsp;&#8211; he only wanted to take&nbsp;one month of absence from work for family bonding. I get it &#8211; I&#8217;ve seen the how (terribly) mothers are treated when they come back to work after a year of maternity leave &#8211; to a new team, new leadership, into a new assigned role and (worse) desk, and being away for less time should prevent that from happening; he also fears knowledge loss. &nbsp;However,&nbsp;we managed to negotiate it to three in exchange that I would watch&nbsp;Star Wars: the Force Awakens with him[/ref]. &nbsp;His parental leave began in the middle into&nbsp;our trip, and would end with another trip (sandwiching a road trip with friends midway).
Bebe turned 9 months while we were visiting:


<ul>
    

<li>this was the&nbsp;start of self-feeding / baby-led weaning; he pursed his lips and refused any pureed food; instead, he took to ribs and other chunky food</li>


    

<li>we found out that not all kiddie toilet seats are created equal, and had to order one from Amazon, where the curved seat prevented him from arching his back every time we put him on, which affected his bowel movements</li>


    

<li>bum shifting became a means for mobility</li>


</ul>

<blockquote><a href="https://twitter.com/KensingtonRoyal/status/756407093373112320" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Can&#8217;t believe it&#8217;s been three years already!</a>[ref]this is in reference to Prince George but we echo their sentiments[/ref]</blockquote>


Though some days, it feels like more. The latest word trend after terrible twos, is not terrifying threes, but threenager. This past year was definitely a year of growth for Bean, both physically and developmentally, expressing herself more verbally, and understanding negotiation tactics, and lately, how to use a firm no. Instead of terrible or tantrum twos (thankfully), I would say teary twos, with more tears&nbsp; as of late and constant[ly the same] questions, accompanied with some whining, as she flip flips from learned independence to craved dependence. She enjoys watching mommy cook and helps out wherever she can: whether it&#8217;s loading the laundry machine, putting dishes away, prepping food for cooking &#8211; I often have to remind myself that although it&#8217;s often faster to do it myself, it&#8217;s these moments that are teaching and practice opportunities, and that I will likely regret it later when she does grow up and decide helping mommy do house chores isn&#8217;t exactly fun.&nbsp; She&#8217;s growing up though: almost toilet-trained (didn&#8217;t take the 3 day potty training route), figured out how to blow her nose, uses the correct personal pronouns more often, and eagerly takes on older sister roles, like feeding the baby, or watching and/or playing with him (ie. bossing him around) while mommy is momentarily occupied or keeping a watchful eye from a distance, which when he co-operates is quite wonderful as I can multi-task. She also enjoys finishing off her brother&#8217;s unfinished leftovers, which I remember I enjoyed too when my younger brother was eating baby food. Lately though, she has also reverted to not wanting to sleep on her own at night and wakes up multiple times in one night.
Things that have not changed much through the first three years:


<ol>
    

<li>She is&nbsp; happy to be the cautious observer-follower instead of the leader, though she can be determined/persistent (aka stubborn, like both her parents) &#8211; which sometimes translates to being fiesty, and/or bossy. For her, being a cautious observer seems to lends well to having an eye for detail and a good memory.</li>


    

<li>She hates the feeling of tears and runny nose on her face when it is caused by crying and she refuses to wipe it herself. The more you make her, the more water works result &#8211; a vicious cycle, really. Meltdowns often happen around some seemingly inconsequential thing, but it&#8217;s really a build-up of unsaid/unresolved feelings inside (maybe it&#8217;s feeling like she&#8217;s not being heard or lack of closeness / security that you&#8217;re there)</li>


    

<li>Early enthused independence of feeding herself does not translate to continued self-independence</li>


</ol>

In other developmental news, our almost 8-month old can now roll over from front to back, and back to front, though I think he really just rolls in one direction each way. He also can sit up unassisted for extended periods, and we have been practicing moving by trying to place items he wants a little beyond his reach. While he mouths everything, I can already sense that he is a much pickier eater than Bean was, despite his love for bananas and apples and sometimes sweet potatoes; he appears to really dislike yogurt, and maybe because it&#8217;s really cold and when upon skin contact, it turned red (like it did with peanut oil, tomatoes, and oranges for Bean). While we haven&#8217;t given rice cereal after that one time when he threw it all up, he doesn&#8217;t seem to have any problems with regular rice or barley. We need to give him more opportunities to practice grabbing food and eating it, which he has been with chunks of bananas, raw chunks of apples and celery sticks (a perfect gnawing/teething food I find), cooked zucchini and pasta tubes (rigatoni), a messy experiment as it often ends up on the floor, though I might try cooked broccoli florets or carrots next; the harder foods like apples and celery I need to watch closely as sometimes he swallows before chewing it well.&nbsp; He&#8217;s still a relatively chill baby, which I am especially thankful for&nbsp;as I don&#8217;t think I would be able to handle two of the same temperaments; he is content to spend time in the playpen (or modern term: play yard) with his toys or chewing on a toy in his swing, preferring these two items more often than in the bouncer, and I can leave him for a short to an extended period, depending on his mood, before he complains, whereas his sister would still prefer that I am next to her all the time, if she had her way.&nbsp; I&#8217;m glad our playpen is getting some use, as Bean didn&#8217;t like it back then (same story with Sophie la giraffe), although she now enjoys going inside at times to sit and play with him! He&#8217;s also been able to effectively eliminate on the mini toilet seat a few times which saved me from having to clean up a messy (cloth) diaper, but we have also encountered baby in pain while trying to strain, poor boy.


<blockquote>For this boy I prayed, and the Lord has given me my petition which I asked of Him. So I have also dedicated him to the Lord; as long as he lives he is dedicated to the Lord.&#8221; &#8211; 1 Samuel 1:27-28a (NASB)
Train up a child in the way he should go: and when he is old, he will not depart from it.&#8221; &#8211; Proverbs 22:6 (KJV)</blockquote>


As parents, we feel that it is important to lead and spiritually nurture our children so that they will develop a desire to love God and be followers of Christ, so&nbsp; while we had a small baby dedication ceremony at Bean&#8217;s one-month celebration, we decided to wait until j.w&#8217;s family could join us and held off until this year&#8217;s baptism service at our church (which effectively became a baptism + baby dedication service); it was especially meaningful to see our friends and family who don&#8217;t normally go our church present as I felt like they&#8217;re the ones that will support us in raising our children[ref]it takes a village, as the saying goes [/ref].

<h2>3:</h2>


A friend recently commented that I look thinner yet again, and to my surprise when I stepped on the scale, she was right. Turns out it took me almost 8 months, 3 months longer to reach the low end of my last postpartum weight loss, and more &#8211; no wonder my pants all feel loose; I was beginning to attribute it to pregnancy stretching them out.&nbsp; I&#8217;d better consult the &#8220;<a href="http://her.happyhippos.ca/2013/12/how-to-gain-more-weight/">How to gain more weight</a>&#8221; post again. /86]]&gt;		</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				<![CDATA[I can hardly believe that he's already half a year old. Month six marks the beginning of solids. First foods: Avocado first, then sweet potato. We skipped rice cereal as the absolute first food. I enjoy making him laugh, stare intently at my silly expressions, and encouraging him to blow raspberries / bubbles.
He is currently working on:


<ul>
    

<li>Rolling over from front to back</li>


    

<li>Starting to sit on his own for short periods of time, but I always am close by because he tends to teeter over</li>


    

<li>Growing his first tooth. He pulled my finger into his mouth a few days ago, and when he gnawed down my finger, I noticed something sharp. He puts everything in his mouth though (his hand was in his mouth at birth after all), but lately, he loves Sophie; I know this because he lets me know with displeasure when she&#8217;s dropped. Thank goodness they&#8217;re getting some use, because Bean didn&#8217;t put anything in her mouth, so our quality teething toys were neglected (they&#8217;re pricey!)</li>


</ul>


As I celebrate[ref]in-laws came this year to help, thus relieving me to go off to get birthday freebies, enjoying a long nap (longer than a current sleep cycle at night), a dinner+dessert date with j.w, and daddy took the kids for their bed time while I enjoyed an evening out with small group friends, all #kidfree over a course of a few days![/ref] being another year older, a conversation I had with a friend from my high school days reminded me that this year is significant because it would mean I have spent almost half my life in Ontario. <em>Crazy</em>. That means after this point, I can&#8217;t and shouldn&#8217;t be calling &#8220;Vancouver&#8221; home unless I move back.
Next month, Bean will turn three. We&#8217;re <em>still</em> working on toilet training &#8211; that&#8217;s the biggest challenge; I feel guilty since I missed the window of opportunity (the time when she peed without any bottoms on and realized it was on her leg, and she told me that she needed to go the second time during the same hour). As she gets older, I realize that one of her current combo strength is an eye for detail and a good memory &#8211; unless this happens with every kid. She observes and remembers the tiniest details: I ask her if she&#8217;s seen pieces of her toys&nbsp; a day or so later, she tells me; she tells me she threw the cloth diaper behind my bed a few days ago; describes what she ate and drank during her time while mommy+baby has a program; and tells me about the brown dog at a new friend&#8217;s house, with the blue leash (turns out, my husband tells me that it&#8217;s a stuffed dog &#8211; no wonder she wasn&#8217;t afraid of it!). She also seems to notice or ask me about things that I wouldn&#8217;t expect a toddler to pay attention to, like what&#8217;s on a specific shelf after I briefly open and close the fridge door.
So here&#8217;s to getting older (but not necessarily wiser)!]]&gt;		</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				<![CDATA[I cannot believe he's five months old already! I remember the first six months of Bean's life felt like a long time, but alas, #secondchildsyndrome; no wonder some moms with older kids miss the baby years. In a month's time, our lives will begin to get more complicated, when he becomes more mobile and starts solids and thus, smelly and poopy diapers that are no longer water-soluble.
#secondchildsyndrome means that he lacks dedicated one-on-one time with mom, resigning to being propped up on swing to observe what's going on around him (until he gets restless and complains). Some people have asked how our second one is, and he's still pretty chill in comparison to our first. My theory is because first-time moms are often more anxious when babe is still growing inside, but with subsequent pregnancies, they become more 'lax, so it somehow transfers to them. As parents, we're not supposed to compare our children - especially in front of them, but I can't help but say that there are definitely traits that the siblings share, but he's also very different from his sister:


<ul>
    

<li><strong>Similarities</strong>: they both had a phase where they disliked car rides, and let me tell you that driving with a crying baby is very stressful and makes for a very unpleasant ride for everyone (though the toddler&#8217;s coping mechanism seems to be singing to herself); they both battled a severe bought of eczema; when there are visual distractions around, they fall asleep faster and stay asleep longer with a breathable covering over their heads; a bald spot appeared on their back of their heads from shaking their heads back and forth vigorously on their sleeping surfaces; they now share the same size diapers</li>


    

<li><strong>Differences</strong>: he tolerates the swing; can fall asleep on his own fairly quickly when he is swaddled and has a pacifier; does not fall asleep much while breastfeeding and will finish a feed fairly quickly; he happily puts everything in his mouth (after all, he was pretty much born sucking on his hand, which means we might have to baby-proof the house which we didn&#8217;t have to worry about before); he is a heavy baby, chubs, with a big head (he&#8217;s now around 16-17 lbs) &#8211; thankfully that was of the boy and not the girl, and thankfully for the second, since my muscles are slightly used to the heavier first child</li>


</ul>


#secondchildsyndrome means that I almost missed some milestones, or failed to record them &#8211; including a lack of photos, especially photos with the entire family and me and him together:


<ul>
    

<li>lots of cooing still; he has discovered how to blow bubbles and figured out how to make a high-pitched squeal &#8211; which is amusing because his friend, just a couple of months older than him went through the same thing a few weeks ago (and he reminded her to blow bubbles again haha)</li>


    

<li>he knows how to reach up to play with toys &#8211; I put him in the play pen and I had dangled a toy off the mobile, and he reached up to play with it</li>


    

<li>he also managed to rotate 90 degrees in the playpen &#8211; probably by pushing his feet against the sides</li>


    

<li>tummy time is a bit easier for him now &#8211; he can hold his head up longer before complaining (instead of a face plant into the floor)</li>


    

<li>he can almost sit up like a tripod (bent forward toward his toes)</li>


    

<li>he sits up better in the bumbo these days, but he still tends to lean sideways shortly after he&#8217;s in</li>


    

<li>his sleep-cycle is more regular: 2 in the morning (30-40 min nap within 2 hours of the morning wake-up, then another 30-40 min nap 2 hours after that, usually around when we eat lunch thankfully), and 1 long nap in the afternoon (when toddler is sleeping &#8211; first by himself, and then with me feeding/holding him), a short nap just before or during dinner, and bed time around when the toddler sleeps</li>


</ul>


In toddler news, her current favourite colour is green and ESL English/Chinglish is picking up speed, despite a Chinese accent that accompanies it (though her English seems more whiny than her Chinese &#8211; not sure if it&#8217;s just the tone of voice). Her appetite is growing, and pan-fried, grandma-made potsticker dumplings are one of our favourite lunch meals right now, because she feeds herself &#8211; with chopsticks &#8211; for most of the meal, and she can eat up to 7 dumplings at a time! The other day, at her friend&#8217;s 5yo birthday party, she was one of the few younger ones who enjoyed following the dance teacher&#8217;s instructions &#8211; maybe it&#8217;s time to sign her up in some form of group lessons or activity soon.]]&gt;		</p>
