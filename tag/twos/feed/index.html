								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				<![CDATA[A bittersweet proud mama moment.
Wow! After a little more than two and a half years, Bean is now naturally okay with me leaving the room before falling asleep - which leaves me with a little more free time in the evenings and some time in the afternoon when her brother is napping. &nbsp;She surprised me when&nbsp;she practically kicked me out during one of her naps when she heard her brother crying the other day, saying that I needed to feed him. Now, I tell her that I've forgotten to brush my teeth, she chimes in and tells me that I've forgotten to shower, and sends me away after I tuck her in and telling her she doesn't need to be scared, and leaving the door open a crack. After hearing my mother tell me that if I don't let her cry it out, then she will continue to need me until years later (like&nbsp;into school age), I wasn't quite prepared for this as she was still making sure to hug me closer when she heard her brother cry just a week or two ago, and then reluctantly let me go after I told her I would come back. We're on Day 3 - dare I&nbsp;hope that this will become a new routine that sticks?]]&gt;		</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				<![CDATA[To pee or not to pee, that is the question.
I sometimes wonder whether our toddler feels the urge to go at the most inconvenient times on purpose: in the middle of the meal, or when she's supposed to be falling asleep after lights out or during nap time. Of course, this prolongs either routine, and every time I take her, she does of course actually go. But when I ask her if she needs to go outside of those times, of course she doesn't (and won't). And then, there's this&nbsp;strange habit of sucking on her finger when she has the urge to go, which is a nice visual cue for me if I catch it, because she doesn't always tell me. Ah, the joys of toilet training (on her schedule instead of a 3 day boot camp schedule).
Woo-hoo! Today marks the first day that the baby fell asleep before the toddler's nap time and napped&nbsp;through the long excruciating process, leaving my hands free to pull tissues to wipe her tears and nose while trying to wait for her to fall asleep. Sadly, it's the pacifier that saves the day.]]&gt;		</p>
