Wow! After a little more than two and a half years, Bean is now naturally okay with me leaving the room before falling asleep &#8211; which leaves me with a little more free time in the evenings and some time in the afternoon when her brother is napping. &nbsp;She surprised me when&nbsp;she practically kicked me out during one of her naps when she heard her brother crying the other day, saying that I needed to feed him. Now, I tell her that I&#8217;ve forgotten to brush my teeth, she chimes in and tells me that I&#8217;ve forgotten to shower, and sends me away after I tuck her in and telling her she doesn&#8217;t need to be scared, and leaving the door open a crack. After hearing my mother tell me that if I don&#8217;t let her cry it out, then she will continue to need me until years later (like&nbsp;into school age), I wasn&#8217;t quite prepared for this as she was still making sure to hug me closer when she heard her brother cry just a week or two ago, and then reluctantly let me go after I told her I would come back. We&#8217;re on Day 3 &#8211; dare I&nbsp;hope that this will become a new routine that sticks?		</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				To pee or not to pee, that is the question.<br />
I sometimes wonder whether our toddler feels the urge to go at the most inconvenient times on purpose: in the middle of the meal, or when she&#8217;s supposed to be falling asleep after lights out or during nap time. Of course, this prolongs either routine, and every time I take her, she does of course actually go. But when I ask her if she needs to go outside of those times, of course she doesn&#8217;t (and won&#8217;t). And then, there&#8217;s this&nbsp;strange habit of sucking on her finger when she has the urge to go, which is a nice visual cue for me if I catch it, because she doesn&#8217;t always tell me. Ah, the joys of toilet training (on her schedule instead of a 3 day boot camp schedule).<br />
Woo-hoo! Today marks the first day that the baby fell asleep before the toddler&#8217;s nap time and napped&nbsp;through the long excruciating process, leaving my hands free to pull tissues to wipe her tears and nose while trying to wait for her to fall asleep. Sadly, it&#8217;s the pacifier that saves the day.		</p>
