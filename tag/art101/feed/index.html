								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				<![CDATA[As I perused the Community Centre offerings fall guide for affordable and interesting classes, one program was titled "Adult Drawing". I was intrigued: for less than $5 per 1.5 hour, with supplies included, what would it cover? Just in case, I called them to make sure "adult drawing" wasn't a nude model course.


<h3>First class</h3>


I haven&#8217;t&nbsp;really drawn&nbsp;or taken up any drawing classes since Art 10 (high school), so I was slightly intimidated when at the first class, I see other adults already bringing out their supplies (watercolor and pencils, though watercolor isn&#8217;t something the instructor will focus on &#8211; she does have a set for Chinese painting, where you have to grind the blocks to get the color you want) &#8211; weren&#8217;t supplies going to be included? Clearly, these adults all have some drawing experience. Then again, even in high school, I found art class to be slightly intimidating but always humbling because:


<ul>
    

<li>a) I don&#8217;t have confidence in my work #ownworstcritic</li>


    

<li>b) I compare my artwork with other students around me, and to me, other people&#8217;s work often look better</li>


    

<li>c) the teacher, when trying to give you tips or critiquing your work, does it in front of the class or within hearing distance of other students</li>


</ul>


To start of the class, the instructor&nbsp;asked us to drawing anything we wanted. I didn&#8217;t particularly enjoy that exercise as I had no idea where to begin on this blank sheet of paper; I tend to have a harder time pulling ideas out of thin air without any direction or inspiration. People around me were already busily drawing realistically-based flowers, faces, hands, birds,&nbsp;and after rejecting my first instinct to draw something cartoony (a house, plane, car, dog&nbsp;&#8211; that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m used to drawing for a two-year old), I ended up drawing a turtle based off of a blob on the table that reminded me of a turtle. Thankfully, the rest of the evening was&nbsp;an exercise in&nbsp;copying what she was inspired to draw based on what the class had drawn, and in the process, she explained how and why to draw a particular detail.
By the end of the first class, she already mentioned some artists in passing, most&nbsp;of which I didn&#8217;t recognize&nbsp;(don&#8217;t have art history but did recognize a classic name or two), in addition to some art theory,&nbsp;including:


<ul>
    

<li>never smudge &#8211; not with your fingers or&nbsp;smudging aids, as you&#8217;re smudging your own lines, your identity in your work&nbsp;away</li>


    

<li>some artists didn&#8217;t believe in &#8220;mistakes&#8221; (the art of not erasing)</li>


    

<li>&nbsp;&#8220;masses&#8221; which she sort of explained as a component that makes up the sum of its parts, like&nbsp;the head of&nbsp;a body</li>


    

<li>on shading:&nbsp;&#8220;Shading is organised scribbling&#8221; (but not in a way that tree leaves look like alligator teeth)</li>


    

<li>repetition is necessary &#8211; lines end up blending to resemble something recognizable</li>


</ul>


It was my first time (from what I remember) using a graphite stick and I&nbsp;found that I preferred using&nbsp;it over 8B charcoal pencil because it is more forgiving, and it hides more mistakes. And maybe that explains my fear of using pen as a medium &#8211; I feel like I&#8217;m committing each stroke of my pen and can&#8217;t go back (and thus my fear of commitment resurfaces in art).

When I got home, I wondered out loud if someone brand new to drawing would have been able to follow along. The instructor did comment that she felt our class had a strong foundation (it appears many have had some formal art training, like in watercolors, so they understand ideas such as composition, proportions, flow, light and dark), but j.w did say that it&#8217;s unlikely that someone who had no interest in drawing would have signed up, so each student must have had some experience drawing before &#8211; whether self-taught or otherwise. I am curious how my art will progress throughout the next 10 weeks; I will have to go back and compare it from the beginning once the class ends.]]&gt;		</p>
