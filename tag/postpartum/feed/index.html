<h2>1:</h2>




<blockquote><a href="https://twitter.com/KensingtonRoyal/status/756407093373112320" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Can&#8217;t believe it&#8217;s been three years already!</a>[ref]this is in reference to Prince George but we echo their sentiments[/ref]</blockquote>


Though some days, it feels like more. The latest word trend after terrible twos, is not terrifying threes, but threenager. This past year was definitely a year of growth for Bean, both physically and developmentally, expressing herself more verbally, and understanding negotiation tactics, and lately, how to use a firm no. Instead of terrible or tantrum twos (thankfully), I would say teary twos, with more tears&nbsp; as of late and constant[ly the same] questions, accompanied with some whining, as she flip flips from learned independence to craved dependence. She enjoys watching mommy cook and helps out wherever she can: whether it&#8217;s loading the laundry machine, putting dishes away, prepping food for cooking &#8211; I often have to remind myself that although it&#8217;s often faster to do it myself, it&#8217;s these moments that are teaching and practice opportunities, and that I will likely regret it later when she does grow up and decide helping mommy do house chores isn&#8217;t exactly fun.&nbsp; She&#8217;s growing up though: almost toilet-trained (didn&#8217;t take the 3 day potty training route), figured out how to blow her nose, uses the correct personal pronouns more often, and eagerly takes on older sister roles, like feeding the baby, or watching and/or playing with him (ie. bossing him around) while mommy is momentarily occupied or keeping a watchful eye from a distance, which when he co-operates is quite wonderful as I can multi-task. She also enjoys finishing off her brother&#8217;s unfinished leftovers, which I remember I enjoyed too when my younger brother was eating baby food. Lately though, she has also reverted to not wanting to sleep on her own at night and wakes up multiple times in one night.
Things that have not changed much through the first three years:


<ol>
    

<li>She is&nbsp; happy to be the cautious observer-follower instead of the leader, though she can be determined/persistent (aka stubborn, like both her parents) &#8211; which sometimes translates to being fiesty, and/or bossy. For her, being a cautious observer seems to lends well to having an eye for detail and a good memory.</li>


    

<li>She hates the feeling of tears and runny nose on her face when it is caused by crying and she refuses to wipe it herself. The more you make her, the more water works result &#8211; a vicious cycle, really. Meltdowns often happen around some seemingly inconsequential thing, but it&#8217;s really a build-up of unsaid/unresolved feelings inside (maybe it&#8217;s feeling like she&#8217;s not being heard or lack of closeness / security that you&#8217;re there)</li>


    

<li>Early enthused independence of feeding herself does not translate to continued self-independence</li>


</ol>

In other developmental news, our almost 8-month old can now roll over from front to back, and back to front, though I think he really just rolls in one direction each way. He also can sit up unassisted for extended periods, and we have been practicing moving by trying to place items he wants a little beyond his reach. While he mouths everything, I can already sense that he is a much pickier eater than Bean was, despite his love for bananas and apples and sometimes sweet potatoes; he appears to really dislike yogurt, and maybe because it&#8217;s really cold and when upon skin contact, it turned red (like it did with peanut oil, tomatoes, and oranges for Bean). While we haven&#8217;t given rice cereal after that one time when he threw it all up, he doesn&#8217;t seem to have any problems with regular rice or barley. We need to give him more opportunities to practice grabbing food and eating it, which he has been with chunks of bananas, raw chunks of apples and celery sticks (a perfect gnawing/teething food I find), cooked zucchini and pasta tubes (rigatoni), a messy experiment as it often ends up on the floor, though I might try cooked broccoli florets or carrots next; the harder foods like apples and celery I need to watch closely as sometimes he swallows before chewing it well.&nbsp; He&#8217;s still a relatively chill baby, which I am especially thankful for&nbsp;as I don&#8217;t think I would be able to handle two of the same temperaments; he is content to spend time in the playpen (or modern term: play yard) with his toys or chewing on a toy in his swing, preferring these two items more often than in the bouncer, and I can leave him for a short to an extended period, depending on his mood, before he complains, whereas his sister would still prefer that I am next to her all the time, if she had her way.&nbsp; I&#8217;m glad our playpen is getting some use, as Bean didn&#8217;t like it back then (same story with Sophie la giraffe), although she now enjoys going inside at times to sit and play with him! He&#8217;s also been able to effectively eliminate on the mini toilet seat a few times which saved me from having to clean up a messy (cloth) diaper, but we have also encountered baby in pain while trying to strain, poor boy.


<blockquote>For this boy I prayed, and the Lord has given me my petition which I asked of Him. So I have also dedicated him to the Lord; as long as he lives he is dedicated to the Lord.&#8221; &#8211; 1 Samuel 1:27-28a (NASB)
Train up a child in the way he should go: and when he is old, he will not depart from it.&#8221; &#8211; Proverbs 22:6 (KJV)</blockquote>


As parents, we feel that it is important to lead and spiritually nurture our children so that they will develop a desire to love God and be followers of Christ, so&nbsp; while we had a small baby dedication ceremony at Bean&#8217;s one-month celebration, we decided to wait until j.w&#8217;s family could join us and held off until this year&#8217;s baptism service at our church (which effectively became a baptism + baby dedication service); it was especially meaningful to see our friends and family who don&#8217;t normally go our church present as I felt like they&#8217;re the ones that will support us in raising our children[ref]it takes a village, as the saying goes [/ref].

<h2>3:</h2>


A friend recently commented that I look thinner yet again, and to my surprise when I stepped on the scale, she was right. Turns out it took me almost 8 months, 3 months longer to reach the low end of my last postpartum weight loss, and more &#8211; no wonder my pants all feel loose; I was beginning to attribute it to pregnancy stretching them out.&nbsp; I&#8217;d better consult the &#8220;<a href="http://her.happyhippos.ca/2013/12/how-to-gain-more-weight/">How to gain more weight</a>&#8221; post again. /86]]&gt;		</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				<![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_4950" align="alignright" width="299"]<img class="size-full wp-image-4950" src="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/sleep.png" alt="Fitbit sleep" width="299" height="262"/> I went to bed close to 1AM, but my fitbit correctly detected that I didn&#8217;t actually get a chance to sleep until&nbsp;past&nbsp;4AM[/caption]
While I usually welcome routine and structure,&nbsp;I feel&nbsp;like I am&nbsp;wasting my days&nbsp;away&nbsp;in too&nbsp;much routine lately, to the point where every day feels the same.&nbsp;Perhaps it&#8217;s cabin fever from postpartum confinement&nbsp;that seems like time is dragging,&nbsp;and yet, he&#8217;s almost three weeks old, and I only have 10ish days left before I can freely leave the house (without feeling guilty or lectured at) whether to get some fresh air or a change in environment.
Even with help, I&#8217;m feeling drained and spent; I don&#8217;t know how single&nbsp;parents or&nbsp;those whose spouses&nbsp;are away do it &#8211; kudos to them. One huge advantage of the postpartum confinement practice is the help: I can get away from not having to do dishes, cook meals, change as many diapers,&nbsp;and entertain the toddler so I can&nbsp;feed the baby on demand,&nbsp;&nbsp;get some shut-eye to make up for the little sleep I get at night. When help &#8211; in the form of either set of parents &#8211; leaves, I worry most about how to juggle the sleep schedules&nbsp;with two (bad parenting habits on our part&nbsp;as some would say, as the toddler requires too much help to fall asleep). I also hope I can figure out a way to connect with my daughter again because right now, I feel like mommy doesn&#8217;t have fun with her anymore; instead, mommy is just around to help her do things (like change diapers, feed her, bedtime routine, take her to the toilet, wash her hands) &#8211; which is probably why she&#8217;s even more resistant to other people helping her do these things these days, and would on occasion&nbsp;breakdown or have an outburst as a result.
Lately, a typical day looks like: <span style="color: #008000;">feed baby</span>, <span style="color: #008000;">change diaper</span>, <span style="color: #ff9900;">eat a meal</span>, <span style="color: #ff00ff;">feed toddler</span>, <span style="color: #008000;">feed baby</span>,&nbsp;<span style="color: #ff00ff;">put toddler&nbsp;down for a nap (short bedtime routine)</span>, <span style="color: #ff9900;">power nap or laundry</span>, <span style="color: #008000;">feed baby</span>, <span style="color: #ff00ff;">tend to toddler who has woken up within the hour</span>, <span style="color: #800080;">change diapers on both</span>, <span style="color: #ff9900;">eat another meal</span>, <span style="color: #ff00ff;">feed toddler</span>,<span style="color: #008000;"> feed baby</span>, <span style="color: #ff00ff;">persuade the toddler to fall sleep (long bedtime routine)</span>, <span style="color: #008000;">feed&nbsp;baby</span>, <span style="color: #ff9900;">some down time and snacks</span>, and repeat the following until the morning:&nbsp;<span style="color: #008000;">feed baby</span>,&nbsp;<span style="color: #ff9900;">nap</span>, <span style="color: #008000;">feed baby</span>,&nbsp;<span style="color: #008000;">change diaper</span>, <span style="color: #008000;">feed baby</span>,<span style="color: #ff00ff;"> settle&nbsp;toddler</span>. (<span style="color: #008000;">green</span>: baby, <span style="color: #ff9900;">orange</span>: me, <span style="color: #ff00ff;">pink</span>: toddler)
Nights are the hardest because when I&#8217;m not sleeping, I silently will&nbsp;my&nbsp;husband to share in&nbsp;misery&nbsp;instead of&nbsp;serenely sleeping away or wonder why my toddler&nbsp;can&#8217;t easily&nbsp;be consoled by&nbsp;daddy when she wakes up&nbsp;in the middle of the night (and decides to cry for an hour instead). &nbsp;I know these aren&#8217;t very nice (or godly) thoughts&nbsp;and I know it gets better eventually, but it doesn&#8217;t mean that they escape me.&nbsp;There has been a week of reprieve, where he actually followed a nice 2-3 hour feeding schedule, and slept nicely in between.&nbsp;<del>Sadly, it didn&#8217;t last and&nbsp;was too good to be true.</del>&nbsp; At the time I started writing this post,&nbsp;he decided to feed every 1-2 hours nightly for a few days likely due to a growth spurt, but last night, it was nice to be back on a 2-3 hour sleep cycle again (funny how 2-3 hours is what to look forward these days). Though, it&#8217;s nice to have caught up with my Netflix playlist as a result.
The past few weeks have gone by quickly in terms of baby&#8217;s growth: he lost 10% of his birth weight, but recovered 1 kg within a week. Perhaps it&#8217;s because the midwife wisely waited until he grew a bit before doing the heel poke&nbsp;for the newborn tests, but he didn&#8217;t even flinch or cry when she drew blood.&nbsp;While he easily tucked into my arms before, his feet now stick out when he&#8217;s feeding. He gurgles and snorts and makes all sorts of funny expressions and noises, and while he slept through all sorts of background noises the second week, it seems like he&#8217;s&nbsp;starting to want to be held more during the day. He&#8217;s also prone to burp and regularly spit up (even from his nose, poor guy), which I guess makes up for all the two times Bean did.
This is why babies are hard work! I&#8217;m reminded why I started to enjoy being with and interacting with Bean more&nbsp;after she was 6 months old &#8211; by then, I probably would have a better hang of things&nbsp;with two as well.]]&gt;		</p>
