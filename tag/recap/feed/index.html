<h3>Gen Con: Thursday through Sunday</h3>


I started off my first day of Gen Con with two non-gaming mini workshops on the art and method of zentangle; everyone else stormed the exhibit hall when it opened. I had a great time doodling with a purpose! The rest of the day, I strolled through the exhibit hall collecting freebies, browsing the booths, and demoing a couple of short games.
Other than me joining the audience to watch an interview with the puppeteer and voice of Big Bird and Oscar the Grouch (who knew that they were played by the same person!) and his wife [ref] &#8211; there was an entire puppet stream / track at this convention, and the puppeteer and voice for Kermit the frog and Ernie (both played by the same person) was also there which I missed! [/ref], for the next couple of days, j.w and I spent most of our time together to look around the hall and demo games (at the hall and CGE/Rio Grande rooms); I found myself playing more games when with another person around than on my own.

We stopped for a bit to see the cosplay contest for the first time as we missed out on the parade as our True Dungeon game took longer than expected &#8211; wow, some people are truly dedicated at hand making their costume!


<h3>Games</h3>




<h4>Notes for next time</h4>




<ul>
    

<li>the C n C booth resells Rio Grande games; you can bargain with them.</li>


    

<li>Cool stuff inc has a dings and dents (or last stock) shelf that they restock throughout the convention. You can also use the $2 off coupon in the coupon book with these games.</li>


</ul>




<h4>I would consider buying or playing again</h4>

<ul>
    

<li><a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/257527/trapwords" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Trapwords</strong></a> (coming out in the Fall sometime) &#8211; advanced taboo, best played with people you know</li>


    

<li><strong><a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgameexpansion/233891/ticket-ride-map-collection-volume-6-france-old-wes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ticket to Ride: France</a></strong>: the tracks aren&#8217;t colored ahead of time, so you use one action to assign a color <i>but</i> your opponents could claim it before you do!</li>


    

<li><strong>Roll for the Galaxy: Ambition</strong>: extra cards and goals to complete. I regret not picking this one up at $23 &#8211; $2 at the dents and dings shelf at Cool Stuff Inc. because I wasn&#8217;t sure how it would play and didn&#8217;t know its retail price (later found out it sold elsewhere at the convention for $40). If they reminded me of the $2 off coupon, I would&#8217;ve picked it up. Though, pro-tip, don&#8217;t do as I did: don&#8217;t play and drink for you might roll your drink cup (filled with coffee in my case) instead of your dice cup. Though now that I know Amazon.com has it for $24, thanks to someone telling me about <a href="http://boardgameprices.com">boardgameprices.com</a> at the consignment store, I don&#8217;t feel as regretful.</li>


    

<li><strong>King Domino: Age of Giants</strong> (expansion)</li>


    

<li><strong>drop it</strong>: quick game to play, can play with kids, but hard to master, but would only get it if it was on sale, as the sticker price was $30 USD</li>


    

<li><strong>Cities of Splendor</strong>: adds a bunch of expansion games to Splendor, but would only buy this if we get a copy of Splendor. We&#8217;ve been playing Splendor on our phones / tablet after a friend taught us how to play, but the feel of the game is nice</li>


    

<li><strong>Word slam</strong>: A team vs. team game where you use existing word cards to try to and get your teammates to guess the correct word without using any gestures or your voice. It seemed to get a bit repetitive after a few rounds, but I like word games, so I&#8217;d be willing to give this one another try.</li>


</ul>




<h4>Did not get a chance to try</h4>




<ul>
    

<li><strong>Queen Domino</strong></li>


    

<li><strong>King Domino: Age of Giants</strong> (expansion)</li>


    

<li><strong>Terraforming Mars</strong>: I heard it has a Race for the Galaxy feel to it!</li>


    

<li><strong><a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/244330/scarabya" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Scarabya</a></strong><a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/244330/scarabya" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> &#8211; by Blue Orange, the same publisher and designer of King Domino.</a> I did meet the game designer in person, and it was sort of interesting to see that everyone at the booth was from France except for one American, even though they have an office in Silicon Valley.</li>


    

<li><strong>trash pandas</strong>: I only found this intriguing because I like the art of Sushi Go and the others at the Gamewright booth like this one looked cute, and was sold out on the first day.</li>


</ul>




<h4>Games I tried that I probably wouldn&#8217;t pay money for</h4>




<ul>
    

<li><strong>Catan VR</strong> (needs an Oculus set first)</li>


    

<li><strong>Small World: Sky Island</strong> (too many pieces! would be more fun to play on a tablet or smartphone)</li>


    

<li>Other expansions of Dominion (too many cards! but fun to play anyway)</li>


    

<li>Escape-room type card games. I feel like these are one-time plays and thus a waste of resources</li>


    

<li><a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/141791/pinata" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Pinata</strong></a>: a two-player game that seems kid-friendly but gets really repetitive quickly (maybe that&#8217;s why it&#8217;s perfect for a mother-daughter game); the consignment store had it for $12</li>


    

<li><strong>Chicken Cha Cha Cha</strong>: relies on a lot of memory &#8211; great for a younger audience</li>


    

<li><strong>Codenames: Duet</strong> &#8211; is a fun game but the group game seems more fun</li>


    

<li><strong>True Dungeon</strong> (TD): when j.w played it the first time, he came home raving about it. I think with the rise of escape rooms, I&#8217;d rather spend my money there (works out to be around the same price per hour). TD was a RPG/D&amp;D+Escape room hybrid: you&#8217;re in the dark going from space to space with divider walls draped with fabric to match the theme to separate the rooms; there&#8217;s a dungeon/game master in each room that yells out scenarios and penalties and then some random actors dressed up in themed costumes. I randomly died in the middle of the game (turned into stone after a low die roll), which mean I couldn&#8217;t participate in 3 out of 6 or 7 rooms, so I feel like I got ripped off somewhat.I felt like there was little to no onboarding for new players (had no idea what happened, and when to dock myself life). At the beginning, we spent a considerable time trying to figure out what our given random tokens meant and how to suit up our character by trading our tokens with others as each one had a special ability or armour/weapon. I wish they explained it better that certain tokens are more valuable than others, such as the purple ones, which are ultra rare (1 in every 100 packs), so you don&#8217;t trade them away. Thankfully, j.w had played before so he pocketed the purple one that I had opened (instead of giving or trading it away) and later found out that it sold for $75, but the buy price was $35, so I guess we got back most of my game. At least I contributed to solving a puzzle fairly quickly before our time was up.</li>


</ul>

<ol>
    

<li><strong><a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/98229/pictomania" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pictomania</a></strong>, newest edition (surprised that it was j.w who wanted a copy because it&#8217;s a group game and you have to draw!) &#8211; a hybrid of pictionary and speed where everyone in the game participates at the same time.</li>


    

<li><strong><a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/28620/phoenicia" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Phoenicia</a></strong> &#8211; by the same designer as Race for the Galaxy. Hadn&#8217;t heard of it &#8211; only picked up because it was $10 at the consignment store [ref] future note to self: every day a board game stays at the consignment store, it drops in price[/ref]</li>


    

<li><strong>Pressure Cooker</strong> &#8211; from Rio Grande, looks like Overcooked and for $10, it&#8217;s worth the try
[caption id="" align="alignright" width="680"]<img class="size-medium" src="https://geekandsundry.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/everdell.png" width="680" height="582" /> Image from <a href="https://geekandsundry.com/build-your-new-home-with-critters-and-cards-in-everdell/">https://geekandsundry.com/build-your-new-home-with-critters-and-cards-in-everdell/</a>[/caption]</li>


    

<li><a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/199792/everdell" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Everdell</strong></a> &#8211; definitely my favourite game from our purchases. I hadn&#8217;t heard of this kickstarter game until we passed by the booth on the last day. The artwork was what drew me in first as it reminded me of why I read some graphic novels, then phrases like tableau building, worker resource placement, Race for the Galaxy meets 7 Wonders / Agricola were the right words to hear. This was a game I was willing to pay a lot of money for! The designer, James Wilson, and his wife was there explaining the game and signing the collector&#8217;s edition. I learned that they&#8217;re from Idaho and Gen Con was their first big-city experience. He does embroidery printing as his day job, and that he&#8217;s worked on this game for over 5 years now. They had hoped to sell 100 copies at this convention, but they had sold over 1000 copies by Sunday morning! (so far, I have yet to win a game though <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f641.png" alt="🙁" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> )</li>


    

<li><strong>Race for the Galaxy: Xeno Wars</strong> &#8211; turns out we already have this expansion, but we hadn&#8217;t gotten around to playing with the extra pieces yet, so I didn&#8217;t recognize the cards (but found the box to be very familiar &#8211; and that was why)</li>


    

<li><strong>Robits</strong> &#8211; a kid-friendly $3 game for $1 because we had a $2 off coupon</li>

I had the opportunity to attend <a href="http://www.blnd.ca/#schedule" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BLND</a>, this one-day, full-day UX event (conference) that was entirely <em>free</em> (even the food was free, and the optional bus from/to UW)! By the end of it, I went home impressed at the quality of the talks, the workshops, and the flow of how they managed to jam-pack a day&#8217;s worth of material. This was also the first event where I felt that there was a good mix of community professionals and students, and  got to hear from various people on how they got onto the UX path. I&#8217;ve come to conclude that no one journey is the same, and reflecting back, mine seems just as accidental[ref]but we all know that nothing in life is accidental, and I don&#8217;t believe in coincidences[/ref] as the many who shared their stories[ref]My story? Two English courses in my program piqued my interest, then interactions with those at work, options to either go UX or PM route, and then to research or design route[/ref]. Though, the path can be so much more directed as a student these days, as there are a multitude of programs in this field!
The workshop I chose to attend covered many tips that would have been quite useful in the large corporate environment where I spent a number of years at as a UX person[ref]at a time where UX roles were relatively new and where job titles weren&#8217;t standard across the company or industry convention, so getting HR to recognize that what I did was on par with other peers in the org was only possible with a supportive manager[/ref], and it was a great complement to the keynote talk which reminded us to embrace &#8220;the villains&#8221; (the naysayers or skeptics). I&#8217;m jotting down the condensed / key notes here as I promised to exchange notes with those who went to the others.


<h2>The Art of Stakeholdering</h2>


Workshop by Chelsea Omel (TELUS), Patrick Bach (TD), Markus Grupp (Indigo) &#8211; all formerly at TELUS&#8217; design team focusing on consumer products
Google found me <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/SDNCanada/a-crash-course-in-the-art-of-stakeholdering-patrick-bach-chelsea-omel-markus-grupp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the slides</a>! [ref]it would also appear that 3 of these talks at the other event were given here as well; here is <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/SDNCanada/scaling-service-design-christine-zoltok" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the third</a>. Guess it&#8217;s no surprise that one of the planners of the SDNCanada event was the event organizer for BLND[/ref]
<strong>Stakeholder:</strong> one who has a stake in the enterprise, and involved in or affected by a course of action, who is going to be impacted by what you&#8217;re putting out. The majority of people will not be the perfect stakeholder.
Always remember: it&#8217;s a two-way relationship.

<li>could fall into one of four quadrants / types:


<ol>
 	

<li><strong>prospect</strong> &#8211; low belief, low in understanding of design</li>


 	

<li><strong>skeptic</strong> &#8211; low belief, high in understanding; may become an obstacle or distraction, being a disruption in meetings, and might even rub off on others and lower the energy</li>


 	

<li><strong>eager beaver</strong> &#8211;  low in understanding but high in belief</li>


 	

<li><strong>champion</strong> &#8211; high in understanding and in belief in design</li>

<h3>Write the script</h3>




<ul>
 	

<li>language is important: adopt the language of the people / of the organization</li>


 	

<li>Find out what the words mean; define your context</li>


 	

<li>understand your stakeholders;<strong> understand their</strong> <strong>mental models</strong>:

e.g. the word &#8220;research&#8221; could have different meanings for many people (&#8220;market research&#8221;, &#8220;academically&#8221;, qualitative vs quantitative);
there is a risk of miscommunication when one person has a different mental model than another;
physical mental models (e.g. a house) are easier to illustrate than service experience mental models (e.g. getting your morning coffee/tea)</li>


 	

<li><strong>Group icebreaker idea:</strong> sketch the steps on how each of them would make a cake; how much detail will one insert into a sketch? this helps you to gain insight on what they value and surface assumptions &#8211; where people are at, what they are thinking</li>


 	

<li>Reminder: you might get buy-in into the process, not necessarily into the product / idea, and that could still be considered a &#8220;win&#8221;</li>


</ul>


</li>


 	

<li>


<h3>Set the stage</h3>




<ul>
 	

<li>adapt activities to <em>who</em> is in the room,</li>


 	

<li>workshops: to get people on the same page
types:


<ol>
 	

<li><strong>showing:</strong> for skeptics, prospects; high-production in quality, simple</li>


 	

<li><strong>learning:</strong> for prospect, eager beavers; e.g. Design 101; case-studies, templates, examples to work through together, coaching opportunities such as journey maps, empathy maps</li>


 	

<li><strong>working: </strong>for champions, eager beavers; have clear objectives, advanced tools, and less prep work is usually necessary; the dream state</li>


</ol>


</li>


</ul>


</li>


</ol>


Remember: [embrace failures] sometimes failures can lead to success!


<blockquote>Mastering the art of stakeholdering is what sets you apart</blockquote>


Me: In other words, if I was to assign &#8220;competency&#8221; categories to it (according to HR report cards when it comes to self-assessments and performance reviews), this would be key under influence and persuasion.]]&gt;		</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				<![CDATA[Now that the <a href="http://her.happyhippos.ca/2015/11/things-to-do-in-kw/">adults have ideas on what #kwawesome offers</a>, here&#8217;s a list of no or low-cost drop-in programs that are toddler friendly. While the local libraries, Early Years Centres, and some community centres / associations have great programs for children and caregivers, most of them require registration. I didn&#8217;t take Bean to many programs when she was younger because they were all offered in the morning, which conflicted with her morning nap; now that she&#8217;s just napping in the afternoon, these times work better for us. Drop-in programs are also great for us because it allows flexibility: on low-key days,  or the times we don&#8217;t have the car or the weather isn&#8217;t bussing or walking friendly, we can choose to stay in.
This list is really to help me keep a track of what&#8217;s being offered during the fall and winter terms around us (the start of summer usually means the end of some programs):


<ol>
    

<li><strong>Mondays:</strong> <a href="http://kitchener.ca/en/resources/NA_CFNA_Fall_2015.pdf">Tot Spot at Downtown Community Centre</a>, 9:30-11:30 AM $2/tot</li>

<li><strong>Wednesdays:</strong> <em>to be determined, but you can always bring them to The Museum ($5 admission Wednesdays, free for child under 3)
Or join <a href="http://www.ourplacekw.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Early Years Centre for Music and Movement</a> (offered weekdays.

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				<![CDATA[

<div>A few nights ago, a friend asked me what there was to do in Kitchener-Waterloo, and how I found out about them. This isn&#8217;t&nbsp;the first time someone has asked for ideas, so I figured a compiled list of what I follow may be helpful to my other self and for future reference &#8211; and even though I don&#8217;t necessarily have time do venture out to many events offered around time, I still try sometimes! So what piques my interest? Generally, I like to know about free/low-cost activities that don&#8217;t need&nbsp;too much&nbsp;commitment.</div>




<div>&nbsp;</div>




<div>Here are some of my sources:</div>




<ul>
    

<li>Meetup groups &#8211; a few that I subscribe to, include:


<ul>
    

<li>Badminton Fun in KW&nbsp;&#8211; John sends out a reminder of places that offer drop-in badminton around town (mostly at community centres)</li>


    

<li><a href="http://www.meetup.com/Tri-Cities-Food-Lovers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tri-Cities Food Lovers &#8211;</a> I tend to follow this group for restaurant ideas (haven&#8217;t been to a meetup yet)</li>


    

<li><a href="http://www.meetup.com/Its-On-Events-for-20s-30s-at-Kitchener-Public-Library/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">It&#8217;s On &#8211; Events for 20s and 30s</a>&nbsp;&#8211; a central place for all the events that Kitchener Public Library offers for a specific crowd, though open to all. Note that registration actually happens on the KPL site itself, and that most of it is just a repeat of what&#8217;s listed on the KPL Events Calendar (but easier to find here).</li>


    

<li><a href="http://www.meetup.com/Hiking-for-Beginners-in-Cambridge-ON/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hiking for Beginners</a> &#8211; while the group says Cambridge, Ontario, I find that a bunch of the hikes are actually in the Kitchener area. I tend to follow them to discover trails around me as the timing for the meetups hasn&#8217;t been right for me yet.</li>


    

<li>I also follow the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/KW-Chinese-English-Language-and-Cultural-Exchange/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chinese-English Social Cultural Exchange</a> meetup group to keep a tabs on Chinese eating places around town</li>


</ul>


</li>


    

<li>Public Library events


<ul>
    

<li>I tend to find out about interesting events from the library posters, TV screens, and their <a href="http://www.libraryaware.com/1111/Subscribers/Subscribe?showonlynewsletterlists=true">newsletters</a>;&nbsp;e.g. Etc., Music Notes, KPL News. Popular events that have limited seats tend to fill quickly, and if you end up registering late, you&#8217;ll be added to a waitlist. A few that I&#8217;ve attended include one on <a href="http://her.happyhippos.ca/2015/05/coffee-notes/">coffee</a>, making your own terrarium during #diyfestival,&nbsp; interior design, and an upcoming ones that seem interesting&nbsp;is an&nbsp;art class, an escape room adventure featured for international games day, and a <a href="http://kplca.evanced.info/signup/EventDetails.aspx?EventId=11432&amp;lib=" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DIY string art piece</a>.</li>


    

<li>You can also <a href="http://kplca.evanced.info/signup/EventCalendar.aspx">filter events in the calendar</a> to browse for ones that interest you (hint: set filters by Date: today&#8217;s date, leave end date open; Event type: Adult, Arts &amp; Culture, Business; Age Group: Adults &#8211; List view). Notably, KPL Central branch offers a weekly free movie&nbsp;screening in their theatre space.</li>


</ul>


</li>


    

<li>Community Centres / Community Associations tend to offer many classes at a reasonable cost, but they usually require registration and a 8-10 weeks of commitment. I find that I have to browse through the leisure guides physically because&nbsp;the online versions aren&#8217;t very browseable (ref. <a href="http://issuu.com/cityofwaterloo/docs/waterloo_fall2015_web?e=1669671/14829852" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Waterloo</a> / Kitchener). I&#8217;ve noticed that similar classes tend to vary in price depending on where it&#8217;s offered, perhaps because of&nbsp;each community centre&#8217;s surrounding demographics (e.g. Downtown Kitchener seems to have lower drop-in prices than say RIM Park in Waterloo)


<ul>
    

<li>Cooking classes</li>


    

<li>Art classes (e.g. $5 a class for drawing)</li>


    

<li>Language classes (e.g. ASL &#8211; $5+ /class, Spanish, Conversational Chinese &#8211; $5 a class on Saturday mornings)</li>


    

<li>Social Dance / Ballroom dancing&nbsp;classes, even more affordable than the ones taught at University of Waterloo (outside of&nbsp;the clubs)</li>


    

<li>Drop-in sport activities &#8211; organized and self-organized, such as badminton (from $3 a session)</li>


</ul>


</li>


    

<li><a href="https://enews.kitchener.ca/enews/signup.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">City of Kitchener</a> and <a href="http://enews.waterloo.ca/mailinglist/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">City of Waterloo</a> newsletters, which include a Kitchener Market sub-newsletter


<ul>
    

<li>By extension, the <a href="http://www.downtownkitchener.ca/en/index.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Downtown Kitchener BIA </a>also offers a e-newsletter that&nbsp;highlights events such as <a href="http://nightshiftwr.ca/">NightShift</a> and Art Market, and the <a href="http://frederickartwalk.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">annual Art Walk </a>(local artisans featuring their works for sale)</li>


</ul>


</li>


    

<li>Free <a href="http://www.kitchener.ca/en/livinginkitchener/public_skating_schedule.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">community skating </a>/ <a href="http://www.timhortons.com/ca/en/social/free-swimming.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">swimming / aqua-fit</a> sessions</li>


    

<li>Theatre:


<ul>
    

<li><a href="http://kwlt.org/events" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">KW Little Theatre &#8211; some nights by donation or pay-what-you-can</a></li>


    

<li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/arts/alumni-friends" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Arts Alumni Theatre Night &#8211; free, registration required</a>&nbsp;&#8211; productions by current students at UW</li>


    

<li><a href="http://www.lostandfoundtheatre.com/index.php/ct-menu-item-11/ct-menu-item-13" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lost and Found Theatre &#8211; free nights</a>&nbsp;</li>


</ul>


</li>


    

<li>Free academic / public lectures, for the geek-nerds in us, such as:


<ul>
    

<li><a href="http://perimeterinstitute.ca/outreach/general-public/public-lecture-series" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PI Institute</a>&nbsp;&#8211; I have attended a couple in the past, one on music and physics</li>


    

<li>University of Waterloo <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/hagey-lectures/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Public Lectures</a> (and any of its affiliated colleges)</li>


</ul>


</li>


    

<li>Miscellaneous:


<ul>
    

<li>I really enjoyed the events that Clipped Outdoors offered for women, but they haven&#8217;t been active in a while so I wonder what happened&#8230;</li>


    

<li>Community events offered by local churches&nbsp;(e.g. canning, community gardening) &#8211; I find out about them usually from their signs as a passerby</li>


</ul>


</li>


</ul>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				<![CDATA[The last day of UX Week had a great line-up of speakers and topics, with ideas around<strong> social</strong>, <strong>local, mobile</strong> and some of their comments:


<ul>


<li>Facebook&#8217;s ad designer Paul Adams demonstrated that the web is being rebuilt around <strong>people</strong> &#8211; and, it isn&#8217;t surprising that people live in networks, not in isolation, and have different types of relationships &#8211; though I was rather surprised that the average number of Facebook friends someone has was 130-170, seeing that many of my friends have more than that number.<br />


<ul>


<li>In web design, being social isn&#8217;t about bolting on like and share buttons, but rather about the integration of social networks into the site experience itself&#8230;&#8221;you need to <strong>reorient around people</strong>. If not, someone else will.&#8221;</li>




<li>How? The answer was to understand behaviour and motivation, which was completely what Stephen P. Anderson had stressed in his workshop.</li>




<li>&#8220;The reason why people buy one newspaper over another? It&#8217;s because they agree with what their about to read.&#8221;</li>




<li>&#8220;Influencers make us aware; strong ties make us decide&#8221;</li>


</ul>


</li>


</ul>

<ul>


<li>User experience happens whether you design for it or not &#8211; Teresa Brazen/Kate Rutter</li>




<li>&#8220;I am a nerd&#8221; &#8211; Adam Goldstein, 23 yo from <a href="http://www.hipmunk.com">Hipmunk.com</a>(a travel planning site that I wish I had known about earlier since I had planned 3 trips within a short span of 3 months, based locally in SF)


<ul>


<li>Two strategies in entering crowded markets: yelling or &#8220;smiling&#8221; (services, pleasant surprises). Guess which wins? &#8211; this also tied in well with Stephen P. Anderson&#8217;s workshop on Seductive Interactinon Design.</li>




<li>&#8220;If you&#8217;re in a crowded market, focus on <strong>experience</strong> strategy;<strong> UX is an unfair advantage</strong>&#8220;- which echoed Todd Walthall&#8217;s comment on Day 1 again around experience being the competitive advantage</li>


</ul>


</li>




<li>Darren David reminded us of design challenges and opportunities that we might need to think about when designing for the future: from desktop browsers, to mobile phones, to large canvas spaces around us, such as this concept video by Corning:

<iframe src="http://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6Cf7IL_eZ38" frameborder="0" width="400" height="255"></iframe>

</li>




<li>&#8220;You can&#8217;t fire the customer&#8221; &#8211; Nurat Konar, Interaction Designer at Pixar</li>




<li>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid that I am a s***** designer&#8221; on Sarah B. Nelson&#8217;s fear list, to which I was so relieved to hear, because I thought I was the only who self-doubts</li>




<li>Confessions from a UX designer at Google, Jon Wiley: the origin of the Google search homepage wasn&#8217;t truly because of the move to simplicity, but because the founder, Larry Page, didn&#8217;t know HTML, but the move to the new Google design with the focus on whitespace had negative feedback initially (change), but people were soon okay with it. How did these designs get through in such a short period? With support from leaders at the top.</li>




<li>From Rob Maigret within Disney: focus on long-term <strong>relationships </strong>with customers, not short-term returns; put customers first, marketing second: ads are carbs, stories are protein.<br />


<ul>


<li>How did it work for them? engaging in a 2-way conversation when possible, and quality content and storytelling is the core of their strategy.</li>




<li><strong>Go to where the people are, instead of having people come to you</strong></li>


</ul>


</li>


</ul>


Funny, how this theme of being social, local, mobile resonated throughout the day, but it&#8217;s not something new, and is being preached at other conferences around town (&#8220;social, local, mobile&#8221; is the quote I stole from a friend who attended Dreamforce &#8217;11 &#8211; also held in SF).

<h3>Guerilla Research</h3>




<p>Led by Russ Unger, half of this half-day workshop on Day 2 was &#8220;lecture style&#8221;, and the other half was field work. I had gone into the workshop expecting to learn lot more &#8220;guerilla&#8221; methods, but came out realizing that many of the methods I have used or heard of before, including:</p>




<ul>


<li>Unmoderated testing</li>




<li>A/B testing</li>




<li>Remote testing</li>




<li>User/browser role playing</li>




<li>Mobile testing</li>


</ul>




<p>I cringed every time the faciliator let out the f-bomb (for emphasis, dramatic effect? I never know why people chose to use it in public presentations and speaking), but no one verbally protested so we all let it slide&#65279;. The new methods I came across were:</p>




<ul>


<li>Man on street/coffee shop: testing on the streets</li>




<li>Burrito lunch: food in exchange for testing</li>




<li>Rapid iterative protosketches (RIPS): 3, 2, then 1 design</li>




<li>Empathy maps: personas/game storming</li>




<li>Design the box: take a cereal box and arrange import information into each side &#8211; highlights priorities</li>


</ul>




<p>We practiced the design studio method, putting together an 8-up, which is 6-8 ideas in 5 minutes &#8211; focused on quantity not quality. Then, we pitched and critiqued each others designs as pertinent to the (broad) requirements before merging into 1 design, which was improved upon in an iterative cycle when we validated it with others. Validation of the design was where the field work happened, and admittedly, it was a pretty fun and eye-opening exercise &#8211; especially after the <a href="http://uxweek.posterous.com/the-dry-run-session">dry-run session</a>. Plus, beer was certainly a nice way to end the session, which also led to a few of us staying behind to chat.</p>

<p>Indi Young led this day-long workshop on Day 3, but by the end of the first half, it really had me thinking that I should&#8217;ve taken two half-day ones instead, like the &#8220;How to Work with a Product Manager&#8221; workshop by Kevin Cheng /twitter. Maybe it was because I expected it to be more around what &#8220;mental models&#8221; were and how to build them. Yes, admittedly, the &#8220;lecture&#8221; part of the workshop did cover techniques on how to combine and group (into mental spaces). But in the practical hands-on portion of the workshop, I found most of the focus was around interviewing (which yes, I admit is important but that could be a workshop on its own), card-sorting and design.&#65279;</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				<![CDATA[Day 2 and 3 were workshops, and it was situated nicely between the two days of talks, although unlike other conferences, other non-locals might not be able to attend just the talks, precisely because they were split up.
<strong>Seductive Interaction Design: Are you using what you know about human behaviours in your design?</strong>
The first workshop, led by Stephen P. Anderson, of the book by the same name: <a href="http://www.amazon.ca/Seductive-Interaction-Design-Effective-Experiences/dp/0321725522" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Seductive Interaction Design</em></a>, and  the <a href="http://getmentalnotes.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mental notes</a> pack, was a good complement to Human Factor International&#8217;s course PET (Persuasian, Emotion, Trust). I had hesitated to take this workshop at first, despite the interest in the topic, precisely because I thought it would be redudant.
This workshop was popular, as it filled up pretty quickly, even after it re-opened for more attendees, and his book sold out before the end of the conference.
It was a good refresher anyway. I&#8217;ve known about the techniques to get consumers to buy from the PET course (such as &#8220;5 seats left&#8221; on airline sites, although I found out that some companys break that &#8220;trust&#8221;, because I bought 5 tickets from them, and it showed &#8220;5 seats left&#8221; for the same price again even after my transaction), but one thing I took away from this workshop, was that we can make otherwise ordinary things (or rather painful but unavoidable things, like walking up the stairs or completing a registration form) into something more delightful to engage in: <strong>making it fun</strong>, or delighting.
Anderson started the workshop (and the book) with a video that was circulated awhile back by <a href="http://thefuntheory.com/">a VW initiative </a>where they took some everyday activities/ideas and tried to make it fun &#8211; like throwing out the trash, or using the stairs or the elevator:
<iframe src="http://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2lXh2n0aPyw" frameborder="0" width="400" height="255"></iframe>
In terms of websites, one could be fine in terms of usability, with no obvious problems, but how can it be improved to solve a high bounce rate or low adoption? The answer was around about removing the friction (ie. good usability) PLUS increasing the motivation (psychology; human behaviour) of engagement.
In terms of initial engagement, one needs to stand out from competition.  Which, actually tied in nicely with Todd Walthhall&#8217;s comment the day prior that [good] experience design is our competitive advantage.
The business goals (outcome) should align with user goals (what people do), but Anderson stressed that knowing how humans behave or what motivates one, should not be used in manipulation coercion. We need to think about what poeple need to do in order for your business (goal) to be successful. His advice? <em>Start with functionality, then build out the fun.</em>
Sure, one could look to gaming techniques, but instead of motiviating human behaviour through game mechanics (a concept known as gamification), motivate through psychology. The first often focus on extrinsic rewards are often short-lived, but the latter focuses on instrinsic motiviation.
So what motivates human behaviour? He shared some design ideas on how to do this, such as:


<ul>


<li>Recognition with one&#8217;s own name, human faces</li>




<li>The desire to complete an incomplete set</li>




<li>Desire for self-expression: customizing, creating own profile, self goals and association with self</li>


</ul>

<h3>UX Week 2011: First Impressions</h3>

I have high expectations of UX Week as I chose to attend particular UX &#8211; user experience event/conference (from a selection of many) based on recommendations from people. But, I think I tried to compare it too much to Interactions (an IxD conference), which seems to have more of a practical focus, and also more my area of interest.
So far, UX Week feels more like TED talks for smart UX people, which I am not. Some of the demos, like the ones by 18 year olds blew me away (in a good way) &#8211; companies should be hiring these students! At times, it also felt like Adaptive Path case studies or success stories instead of impartial talks. It&#8217;s more like going to university than college: you don&#8217;t get practical hands-on experience unless you attend the workshops; instead, the talks are rather abstract and somehow you manage to extract principles around the various topics on politics, biology (genetics), business (economics), and mathematics (statistics, algorithms, geometry). And, like school, you see and meet new faces and hope to make friends in your classes/program &#8211; some people know each other from before, or are attending together, but others are like me, attending for the first time and the only one representing their company.
Nice touches: moleskin notebooks to jot down interesting notes and pre-washed alumnimum water bottles to make sure you&#8217;re hydrated throughout the conference. And, they take you to field trips: to the club and to the California Academy of Sciences Night Life, not to mentioned sponsored lunches (although some food ran out by the time I got to the front of the line), and drinks (alcholic and non-alcoholic).

Some common themes or interesting intepreted comments that seemed to surface from the assortment of speakers today:


<ul>


<li>The use of video in experience design, whether as demostrative, to educate, or for pleasure


<ul>


<li>One talk suggested the use of the Kinect and the TV as a digital canvas for painting, but I would argue that it&#8217;s not the same as the tactical feel of painting and the texture is very important in art and painting</li>




<li>People arrange their living spaces, especially the living room, around the TV (us? it&#8217;s around the piano now, and the TV is secondary) but the TV is still primarily a passive, consumption medium</li>




<li>The integration of social content and media can enhance and deliver a richer experience (like the demo of 1dollair from CCA)</li>


</ul>


</li>




<li>Advertising is romanticizing ideals (or ideal purpose of product) &#8211; Jaron Lanier


<ul>


<li>Good point. How many times do we see a car commercial that says something along the lines of stunt driver, closed circuit, do not attempt at home? Or the commercials with perfect models and scenic landscapes&#8230;</li>


</ul>


</li>




<li>&#8220;Feedback is a gift&#8221; &#8211; Todd Walthall


<ul>


<li>His company moved from mail/phone interaction to digital contacts 10:1; and his background in call support, just makes it so much more relevant to what we do</li>




<li>&#8220;Experience design is a competitive advantage&#8221;</li>




<li>The strengths and opportunities at their company echoed some of ours</li>


</ul>


</li>




<li>Sometimes, the story behind the story (product) is just as important &#8211; Chad Jennings


<ul>


<li>People like stories, a narrative can often evoke emotions or a connection (to the author in this case) that a product otherwise can&#8217;t</li>




<li>Also: limiting choice can often help make decisions smoother &#8211; reminded me of the illustration with the supermarket samples where one table had more samples but one had less. The one with more samples had more visits, but ironically enough, the one with less resulted in more purchases. I guess that&#8217;s why sometimes restaurants with a larger menu choice seems to be a bit more overwhelming than one with only a few choices (less broad, more specialty)</li>


</ul>


</li>




<li>More buys/adds doesn&#8217;t mean that it is good in the long run (blockbuster mentality or twitter followers)</li>




<li>We&#8217;re not always aware of why we do things &#8211; &nbsp;we may rationalize differently when asked &#8211; Steven Pemberton


<ul>


<li>I have seen this in user research. When you observe someone attempt a task, sometimes they are not consciously aware of what they are doing until you ask them about it, and the reason they give you may not necessarily match.</li>


</ul>


</li>




<li>Connect people with <em>different</em>&nbsp;skills and perspectives: not 1D-thinking. By avoiding illectual uniformity, which kills critical thinking, you foster complementary collaborators and richer ideas. You may not even like them, but that&#8217;s even better &#8211; Chris van der Halt and PJ Onori</li>




<li>&#8220;Subtlety is the key to everything&#8230;if it feels right, tone it down a notch&#8221; &#8211; Adam Lisagor</li>




<li>If a new user hits a barrier and doesn&#8217;t engage within 7 days after first use (excluding login sign up), they likely won&#8217;t come back &#8211; Mark Trammell for Twitter


<ul>


<li>Why? Some did not understand or see the value or the experience/product did not map to their expectations</li>




<li>Why do some re-engage? The perception of value evolved the more they used it: what brought them here may not have been the same as what kept them here.</li>




<li>One thing they did was to add a step in their sign-up flow preparing for a drop in completion but to allow more connections, but instead an increase in complete resulted, and more people were engaged (29%!)</li>




<li>Sometimes, tweaking the text can change the semantics and increase the perceived value</li>




<li>1 problem may actually be a subset of problems</li>




<li>These insights can definitely apply in my work as we also have those that sign-up but never return</li>


</ul>


</li>




<li>Sometimes accidents result in new experiences (e.g. Edison&#8217;s turn table: dictation machine, not for DJs) &#8211; DJ Spooky/Paul Miller</li>




<li>Lastly, Airbnb and Quora must be a San Francisco-based company (or nearby), because I have heard it mentioned more than once! (And to think that I&#8217;ve only heard of Airbnb within the last 3 months)</li>


</ul>


And that&#8217;s it for Day One!]]&gt;		</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				<![CDATA[I can now say that I actually attended Gen Con, a four-day <i>gaming</i> convention. Going in, I expected to see people similar to those in the Math building at school, and see I did! (and now, I was one of them?!) . I&#8217;m glad that I found other activities to do while in Indianapolis to keep me sane, but at least I came back knowing how to play a few more games that I seem to like: Carcassone, Havana, and Egizia.
So what else did I do?
Yes, I went to the zoo, just like I had told everyone I would. And Trader Joe&#8217;s. Despite going to the zoo on my own, I had a really good time.
Highlights?


<ul>
    

<li>Memorable quotes that I shouldn&#8217;t repeat</li>


    

<li>Visiting the world&#8217;s largest children&#8217;s museum for free (every 1st Thursday evening of the month). We even ran out of time!</li>


    

<li>Interesting eats, including asian-style tacos, happy hour $3 deep-fried onion crisps, and deep-fried butter</li>


    

<li>Touching a shark</li>


    

<li>Seeing Abraham eat deep-fried butter</li>


    

<li>Deep-fried bacon (this was really delish: not-too-salty and crispy bacon deep-fried in light batter)</li>


    

<li>Touching an elephant</li>


</ul>


We ate some of the most interesting foods at the Indianapolis State Fair. Of course, there were the ones we didn&#8217;t try, like chocolate-covered bacon (which I&#8217;m told is a norm now), deep-fried twinkies, oreos, snickers and other candy bars (which isn&#8217;t new), and krispy kreme burgers (patties using donuts as the burgers &#8211; now that is death). I&#8217;m really happy that the guys decided to all come to the State Fair in the end, which made sharing the deep-fried foods more fun! It&#8217;s a shame that it wasn&#8217;t a week later, as we could&#8217;ve also seen Chris Tomlin and TobyMac in concert!
The worship service at the convention on the Sunday was really encouraging. It was encouraging to see that there were gamers who had more to this life than just gaming; a very nice contrast to the talk I sat in during the week, which essentially tried to use &#8220;critical thinking&#8221; to disprove biblical creationism. Their logic seemed to have a lot of syllogistic fallacies, yet they used the arguments to imply that because creation theory has flaws, evolution must then be true.
Anyway, here&#8217;s a quick 5 min highlight video of our Indianapolis trip:
[embed]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8_f5L4AZqk[/embed]
Would I go again? Maybe if I had extra vacation to spare. The extra activities on the side and the company certainly made the trip more memorable. Without them, I don&#8217;t know if I could last at Gen Con for the full amount of time.]]&gt;		</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				<![CDATA[

<p>There&#8217;s something about playing with a group of musicians that beats playing on your own.
Your piece doesn&#8217;t sound like much by itself, but once you play with the rest of the group, the music really sings; you become a part of the experience, the bigger picture.</p>




<p>A number of us attended <a href="http://www.videogameslive.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Video Games Live</a> at the Centre in the Square on the weekend. I never imagined the number of video games I would&#8217;ve actually recognize (and previously played) &#8211; very nostalgic. I wonder if the KW Symphony actually enjoyed playing the pieces, considering the audience would likely be different than the cultured crowd. Don&#8217;t get me wrong, people dressed up, but instead of a night out to the orchestra, it was in costume. I&#8217;m sure a night out at the symphony doesn&#8217;t usually have the crowd hollering and cheering mid-song either.</p>




<p>I like this idea, bringing entertainment into the arts culture, thereby introducing a different group of people with the symphony &#8211; balanced with media, including Skype, videos, video gaming action, and interaction with the audience. Guests included Split Atom (a team from EA / Need for Speed) and Martin Leung (piano player that doesn&#8217;t play with flat fingers even blind folded) However, like many, I felt that the electric guitar after the intermission was too much; the noise from the guitar seemed to drown the music and it felt like the host was trying to show-off a little too much.</p>




<p>But, we concluded that we enjoyed it overall and that it was a fun experience. And if they ever wanted to use it as an avenue to bring more people to buy tickets to more performances by the KW Symphony, it just may have worked (especially if it&#8217;s at reasonable prices). Next up? Perhaps Movies Music in May for $20.</p>
