								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				My pregnant self continues to surprise me. In my pre-pregnancy days, I would think , &#8220;<em>If I ever get pregnant, I&#8217;d want it to be as painless as possible ; in fact, maybe we&#8217;ll just adopt!&#8221;  </em>(I have a low pain threshold) Yet, somehow, over the course of pregnancy, my thinking has evolved from wanting a scheduled/elected C-section to an epidural at a minimum to: &#8220;<em>I&#8217;m hoping for a natural birth if at all possible&#8230;.&#8221;  </em>while keeping an open mind for pain relief choices/options.<br />
And with just over a month to go (less to reach full-term), here&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve continued to discover:</p>
<ul>
<li>My wardrobe has shrunk down to 1/3 of its size, giving us a lot more closest space; maternity clothes from aunts&#8217; generation still seem many sizes too big/wide (and I don&#8217;t think it ever will work at this point), but low-rise skinny jeans/pants still fit, if left partially buttoned with the hair-tie technique or with a belly band</li>
<li>Pelvic bone pain/pressure increase is normal (though at times, walking hurts as a result)</li>
<li>Baby still has room to hiccup and move around, to the amusement of j.w, and Grace and Vivian today</li>
<li>Dad baby books are much more light-hearted and easier to read than mommy books (but with similar content). Why are ours so much more serious?</li>
<li>Belly sometimes gets in the way of putting on socks, pants, and tying my shoe, and especially when going to public washrooms where small stall doors open inwards</li>
</ul>
<p>Outstanding checklist items:</p>
<ul>
<li>Start packing a hospital bag</li>
<li>Complete laundry for baby items</li>
<li>Paint baby room, put up Blik decal</li>
<li>Finish basement</li>
<li>Tidy up and get the house ready for baby and guests</li>
<li>Then, there is the task or obligations of traditional customs like making vinegar ginger soup Long-boiled soup isn&#8217;t a forté of mine to begin with and I dread having to reboil a concoction daily</li>
</ul>
<p>&#8212;-<br />
Side note: I spent a day in Toronto with Grace this past weekend to see <em>Kim&#8217;s Convenience</em> at the Distillery District, a 90-minute, 5-cast (7? character) play that peeks into the life of a Korean family, touching upon cultural and generational stereotypes and ideas between the first-generation parents and their second-generation children, often with moments that I could identify with a comedic approach and some tear-jerking scenes. It was quite appropriate for Father&#8217;s Day weekend, as it was primarily around the dynamics between the father and his daughter (played by Grace&#8217;s friend, also named Grace) and  the son, including how they express love to each other, reminding me of the story of the prodigal son and how our Father&#8217;s love is unconditional. The performance was completely worth the $50, which is more than what I would normally spend on the theatre, but my excuse was that it would probably be one of the last pre-parent outings for awhile&#8230;Plus, the performers (Ins Choi &#8211; also screenwright, Jean Yoon &#8211; who was stopped by an older couple as she cycled by) seemed approachable and pleasant to have a casual chat with. If it stops in Vancouver next May, I&#8217;m going to recommend it to my Vancouver friends, especially the Tungs!		</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				<b>Update:</b> March 9, 2010 &#8211; it appears the Le Gourmand LG3, as reviewed below is now closed, as explained by Toronto Life.</p>
<hr />
My last post about our tasting adventures in Toronto ended with a mention of Le Gourmand.</p>
<h3>Le Gourmand (LG3)</h3>
<p>2177 Yonge Street (near Eglinton)<br />
Toronto, ON<br />
Phone number not listed for this location, but follow them on twitter<br />
Date of visit: June 2, 2009</p>
<h3>Restaurant</h3>
<p>On the way back from Quince, we happened to glance across the street and saw the sign for Le Gourmand, which looked like an expensive steakhouse. When we peered through the glass window, we realized that it felt more like a gourmet, European-style cafe. After taking a look at the menu that&#8217;s posted on the side of the glass door and realized it was within our budget and that the menu (PDF) looked appetizing enough, we tentatively decided on this place for the following night. Grace went home to do some research online, but came up with limited information since it is relatively new. We both knew that every time a fresh batch of cookies came out of the oven, they would tweet it. With a restaurant that&#8217;s keeps up with the times (BlackBerry + twitter) and the rave reviews of their nookie cookies, how could we pass up the chance?<br />
Inside, it looks like a deli cafe, where you can order at the counter (to go) or they serve you at your table. The place isn&#8217;t big so the seating arrangement is somewhat tight, but there&#8217;s a lot of natural light that comes in through the windows, which is supplemented by candles when it gets darker out. I just hope the ant that <i>was</i> (and he is no more) crawling on the window sill was just a one-time occurrence.</p>
<h3>Meal choice, food quality</h3>
<p>Grace ordered the Charcuterie mix platter ($18), which is really just a very expensive tray of smoked gourmet cold cuts that you don&#8217;t normally see anywhere else. This is paired with some bread crackers, which are slightly crisper than the bread they also serve before your meal. I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;d order it on its own, but to share it with my Mint Tagliatelle (braise lamb with mint pasta for $19), it was perfect. Actually, it would&#8217;ve been good with wine, but that wasn&#8217;t in our budget.<br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aimeili/3627961152/" title="IMG_0028 by b.p., on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3597/3627961152_f40c4b4313_m.jpg" width="200" height="130" alt="IMG_0028" /></a><br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aimeili/3594533358/" title="IMG_0026 by b.p., on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3600/3594533358_d2245c6d58_m.jpg" width="200" height="130" alt="IMG_0026" /></a><br />
Some of the smoked meats were more salty than anything, but the speck, which the server highly recommended was indeed very tasty (not that he had to try very hard to convince us of anything). The mint tagliatelle was a broad pasta dish that had mint herbs inside the pasta, which gave it a great texture, making the noodles seem handcut. Normally, I don&#8217;t like ordering pasta because I feel that it&#8217;s something I can make at home or that it&#8217;s really inexpensive to buy, but the herbs and lamb with the pine nuts were a nice touch, and the tomatoes were really sweet; everything just went together very well. I only wished that it was served hotter instead of being lukewarm.<br />
We ended our meal by sharing a berry consomme for dessert ($7) &#8211; the iced lemongrass with yogurt and fresh berries (and edible flower petals too) &#8211; also recommended by our server. We wanted something light, and we certainly got that. I was pleasantly surprised that it tasted so good, with the ingredients that looked so (inexpensive and) easy to make. And, we ended dessert with the $1 nookie cookies, a tiny little chocolate cookie that is loaded with an umfph &#8211; tastes like you bit into a brownie that melts in your mouth. Definitely for those who like sweets, but not really for me.<br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aimeili/3593720063/" title="IMG_0022 by b.p., on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3639/3593720063_ca88d649db_m.jpg" width="200" height="115" alt="IMG_0022" /></a><br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aimeili/3593720499/" title="IMG_0036 by b.p., on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3658/3593720499_6551fe82ac_m.jpg" width="200" height="115" alt="IMG_0036" /></a></p>
<h3>Service</h3>
<p>When the server wasn&#8217;t always around to serve us, another staff would be available for our table. The server, David, obviously is well-known in the neighbourhood, as he would walk outside and wave to the people across the street (further research online suggests that maybe he is the manager). He took the time to describe the stuff on the platter and made some pretty good recommendations. I found it a little unconventional that one would wear a hat inside, but maybe it was because it was the beginning of the shift as that was later removed (we came before dinner started). Grace and I thought that he reminded us of a mutual acquaintance we know (Nate T), which got us wondering how he was doing&#8230;</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>I would make a second visit if I&#8217;m ever in this area again but not necessarily as a regular, if only for the pasta alone.		</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				A friend asked me if I had dream job, what would it be? Sadly, I couldn&#8217;t come up with anything, except that if I was to be a mom, I&#8217;d be a good one (and it&#8217;s not like I want kids!).<br />
So I&#8217;ve been thinking that if I had the talent, the time, and the funding, I would like to be a photographer, capturing candid expressions of the moment and making still life come to life. Better yet, combine it with my foodie tendencies and out comes a food critic! Too bad everybody these days are photographers and foodies.<br />
Anyway, onto my recent Toronto adventures&#8230;<br />
Grace and I had two nights to try some local eats around the Yonge/Eglinton area. We were going to try Lime (pan-asian fusion) but after having Spring Rolls at the Yonge and Eglinton location, I had no desire to eat anything like it for awhile (and if that was my first time at Spring Rolls, I would not have gone to any of its other locations &#8211; let&#8217;s just say that the pad thai was unnaturally pink/red).<br />
Our first stop:</p>
<h3><b>Quince</b></h3>
<p>2110 Yonge Street<br />
Toronto, Ontario<br />
416.488.2110<br />
Date of visit: June 1, 2009</p>
<h3>Restaurant</h3>
<p>Quince is a little restaurant on Yonge just beyond the busy strip. They&#8217;re famous for their homemade gnocchi, the quinoa salad and their wood-fire oven. The menu isn&#8217;t too extensive but the food is worth trying, especially if you like gnocchi (I think Grace will now compare gnocchi everywhere else against this).<br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aimeili/3593719153/" title="IMG_0001 by b.p., on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2441/3593719153_7916e7d7f2_m.jpg" width="178" height="240" alt="IMG_0001" /></a> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aimeili/3594527994/" title="IMG_0014 by b.p., on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3559/3594527994_322bc4f2ab_m.jpg" width="188" height="240" alt="IMG_0014" /></a></p>
<h3>Meal Choice, Food Quality</h3>
<p>A basket of bread is served as a complimentary starter, with a hummus style dip (with cilantro and what tasted like cumin). Both the gnocchi and the wood-oven chicken dishes were under $20, and portion sizes are reasonable. I&#8217;m always wary of ordering pork and/or chicken as sometimes, the middles are dry, bland, or both. Surprisingly, despite the size of the chicken, the white meat wasn&#8217;t dry (though it was less flavourful than the dark meat); I enjoyed the seasoning and did not find it too salty.<br />
We completed our meal with a warm apple tart tatin and a iced passion fruit mousse ($8 each). However, I found that because the mousse was iced, it kind of tasted like ice cream, and the dark chocolate was slightly overpowering the passion fruit taste.<br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aimeili/3593719523/" title="IMG_0011 by b.p., on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3622/3593719523_d07048f188_m.jpg" width="200" height="150" alt="IMG_0011" /></a><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aimeili/3593719421/" title="IMG_0008 by b.p., on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2445/3593719421_1cdfe477a4_m.jpg" width="200" height="150" alt="IMG_0008" /></a></p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Their sample Summerlicious menu looks appetizing and I&#8217;m glad we tried this place over Lime, but if I was to pick to visit a restaurant in this area again, I&#8217;d choose Le Gourmand (LG3) for their uniqueness in food choice instead &#8211; our next adventure.		</p>

<p>Earlier in the Fall (when it was still mild out), I spent a number of hours within 4 blocks on Yonge Street on my own, without a camera to document my experiences. I tried to pass time first by eating a DQ chocolate dilly bar (to suppress my appetite), browsing through stores, then watching the end of Vietnamese Autumn Festival celebrations with a dragon dance, followed by going in and out of Shoppers Drug Mart, after passing by the aromas of Baton Rouge (it smelled and looked delicious). Soon, it got dark, so I went back into Shoppers after being bit by a mosquito, debating on whether I should be spending money on hydrocortisone for my bug allergy and evaluating if marriage was worth it.</p>
<p>As I was walking out, the man at the cashier tapped me on the shoulder and gave me this booklet. I looked down and recognized rudimentary diagrams of signs. In my younger years, when folks like these came into our restaurant to ask for money (in exchange for a booklet), I always wondered if they were pretenders. I finally had the chance to test it out! (and practice ASL with a random stranger). While not speaking a word, I asked him if he signed, and well, he knew it. In fact, we exchanged a few pleasantries, including names and nice-to-meet-yous (thinking back, I hope it wasn&#8217;t &#8220;nice to date you&#8221; that I signed). After that, I really wanted to be able to carry a conversation, but I couldn&#8217;t quite follow (I think he asked me if I took a class) and when he showed me the page on the pamphlet about giving him money (for this booklet), well, I had to sign &#8220;Sorry&#8221;.</p>
<p>As I saw him wander off to the next person, doing the same thing, I wondered how he got through life as a deaf person, if he knew how to speak, and whether he read lips. I thought about my friend, who is hard-of-hearing and her struggles with life and relying on lip-reading. I thought about how she used her knowledge to teach us ASL and wondered if he could do the same. I wondered how I could&#8217;ve helped in other ways besides giving money, but alas, I walked away. I wanted to be able to speak his language, the language that I was intrigued with ever since Auntie Mabel taught us Bible songs in ASL and interpreted the entire lesson for another child. My heart breaks that he needs to use Deafness as a means to get pity and thus, money. What does one do?</p>

I totally forgot to mention about the $2.99 Tropicana OJ w lots of pulp + calcium deal that Sobey&#8217;s I got on the grocery run on Wednesday night.

Sunday school w PT was refreshing and stimulating. Time seems to pass by really quickly in that class and it reminds me of how much I enjoy and miss attending his classes after not getting a chance to participate in them since \~2001 so I only really had bits and pieces of estachology, church history(?), hermeneutics/exegisis, some other one where we talked about santification/glorification/justification, and worldviews.</p>
<p>
Airports. My friend <a href="http://www.xanga.com/item.aspx?user=brassman&#038;tab=weblogs&#038;uid=136216821" target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer">brassman</a> wrote about the topic of airports recently which prompts me to point out that the departure level at Terminal 1 at Pearson is very impressive, but Melissa brought up a very good point &#8211; why do the walls not have clocks to tell time on them? One would think that time is of great importance to travellers that pass through the terminal. Seems like the people in TO are more tech savy as well, as the line up for the express check-in was the longest that I&#8217;ve ever seen. Airports remind me of portals; people rushing about coming from or going to places. As a lone traveller, airports often resonate change to me, signalling goodbye to the past and hello to the future; a place of perpetual and paradoxical emotions.</p>

Greetings from &#8220;the centre of the universe&#8221; (or so they think (&#8220;It really is!&#8221;, says Joseph &#8211; see? my pt precisely)). Yesterday&#8217;s flight was the smoothest I&#8217;ve ever been on in awhile. Although I booked by flight through Tango, I think somehow I think I flew on Air Canada. We ended up getting served  complimentary drinks, a full breakfast and free headsets (to keep) for the movie. I must admit that the service on Air Canada (at least this time around) seems to beat other value flights (Jetgso being one). At the gate, they were kind enough to bump me to an earlier flight and whenever there was turbulence (even slight choppiness), the captain would reassure the passengers over the speaker system. Although they forgot(?) to switch my luggage over, the baggage service offered to issue a claim for me, but I decided to wait. Speaking of wait, I thought I was at a completely different city; the new terminal at Pearson is realllly nice &#8211; the parking stalls even have sensors on them, which electronically deployed to the display at the end of each lane to show how many parking spots are available.</p>
<p>Recap of Friday: Dinner downtown at Linda (Thai) with j.w and andrew. Fellowship with guest speaker Tim Tang (so I finally place a face with the famous UW alumni) and da-lang with some NTCBCers.</p>
<p>Today: downtown to see the graffiti event, which was disappointing. However, the fashion district (Queen) has some really niche store like goth wear stores or really girlie stores. We had some really cheap breakfast in a hole in the wall (Stem Kitchen?). Turns out that this place is a popular joint because it&#8217;s cheap, fast, and decent. there&#8217;s a Ben &#038; Jerry&#8217;s in Toronto! &#8211; the first i&#8217;ve seen in Canada, so of course we went in to have a cone (mine: cherry gracia! yuums.)  The peanut butter cup cone was really good as well&#8230; kind of like Moosetracks!  Anyway, we wandered around Queen St. stores for a bit, dropped by the Sandylion sticker warehouse outlet, went to play initial d (after being dormant for 1 year-i didnt even know that v3 was even out!), had dinnner and played scrabble with BigJon (who of course won).</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				Although the past weekend was Mid-Autumn Fest, I didn&#8217;t really celebrate it or eat mooncake (but I already did in early September), but I <i>did</i> end up in Mississauga and Toronto (to <i>actually</i> GO sightseeing! woo! :} )! On Friday afternoon, DD kindly drove me out to &#8216;Sauga so I could meet up w Mel, my hs friend, who&#8217;s on a co-op double term there. I feel so sorry for her; &#8216;Sauga is so uneventful&#8211;no wonder the three weekends that she&#8217;s been there, she&#8217;s been going out to TO&#8230;I think nobody can really live in &#8216;sauga w/o access to a car for the bus/transit system is sooo ineffecient! Can you believe that the last bus on a evening during the weekend is 20h30?! I know for a fact that in Ottawa and Vancouver, transit systems are generally running until at least midnight, if not later!</p>
<p>
On Friday and Sunday, we just sat around a chilled: Vegged on the couch w Fear Factor, caught up on each other&#8217;s lives and planned for Saturday. Ah yehs, I forgot one crucial afterthought: I ended up finished half (yes, you read me correctly, that&#8217;s 1/2 of a whole) a Dominion&#8217;s chicken, some potato salad, rice, and a bowl of Cream of Mushroom soup that night; boy, was I stuffed! We left the house by 9h00 on Saturday morning to catch the GO train to Union Station ($8.60 round trip). That was my first time on the GO train; apparently, it&#8217;s almost <i>exactly</i> like the <a href="http://www.translink.bc.ca/Service_Info_and_Fares/West_Coast_Express.asp" target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer">West Coast Express</a> in &#8216;couver b/c on the way there, we actually passed a GO train that had old(?) WCexpress cars attached to them. The thing I didn&#8217;t notice on the GO train was the workstations, and plugs for computers, but I guess it&#8217;s also that the fare is slighty cheaper for the distance travelled.
</p>
<p>
Thankfully, I wore really comfie shoes to Mel&#8217;s this weekend, else my foot would&#8217;ve been quite sore. We first tried to find our way to the ROM from Union w this really un-detailed map, but heheh, she ended up looking at the Art Museum of Ontario instead, so we arrived there. Funny though, because we ended up walking in a circle. Ah wellz :). At least we &#8220;found&#8221; the MuchMusic building that we couldn&#8217;t locate on the Net (it&#8217;s on John and near McCaul). Thus, we ended up walking up Queen&#8217;s Park, past the UT St. George Campus (woohoo, now I know where that is too!), to um&#8230;I can&#8217;t remember the name! Dundas? and Bloor St. W to the ROM. Boo, I just missed the <i>Images of Salvation</i> display at the ROM. The ROM is semi-interesting; not interesting enough for me to pay them $18. Did you know that it&#8217;s a pay-as-you-can sorta thing? Apparently, on Saturday, it was free! :). &#8216;cept there really was no signs or anything advertising it, but Melody found it online so YAAY! for her (I can&#8217;t seem to find that anywhere) :P. In actuality, I enjoyed the <a href="http://www.ontariosciencecentre.ca/" target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer">Ontario Science Centre</a> a lot more as it was more interactive and more appliable &#8220;oh-i-c&#8221; exhibits w less &#8220;artifacts&#8221; (which I went in 1999 for free due to my membership to all science centres in the world at that time).
</p>
<p>
So, after a big lunch at McD&#8217;s, we walked onto Bloor and headed towards Spadina and Dupont&#8230;to Casa Loma. &#8216;Twas a nice walk (tho long!) &#8212; Mel complained that I walk too fast hahah, well, all I wanted to do was get there&#8230;.we didn&#8217;t imagine that we had to climb up a hill and some odd steps before reaching this &#8220;castle&#8221;. Thankfully, we had 2 dollars off, so the admission came to $8. However, the self-audio guide included w the admission is very lengthy and the quality unsurpasses the one at Alcatraz island. No wonder &#8220;the Rock&#8221;&#8216;s is an award-winning one!
</p>
<p>
We took many pix, but until I get permission to post them publicly, if you wish to see them, contact me. My mom commented that if I told her that we were in Europe, she&#8217;d believe me :). The castle is nice, I admit it has the typical associations with a &#8220;castle&#8221;: secret tunnels and passages, turrets, nice gardens, etc. etc. However, I find that the <a href="http://www.boldtcastle.com/" target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer">Boldt&#8217;s Castle</a> is prettier (more romantic?:P) :). By the time we finished our pictures and tour, the castle was closing, so we walked back to Union and took the GO train home. During the bus ride back, we last-minutedly decided to risk the bus schedule and eat at the AMC plaza in Oakville. BUT East Side Mario&#8217;s (which M has never been to) had a 1/2 hr line up and w the wait, we&#8217;d never make the last bus home. Thus, we settled for BP (boston-pizza, not me!), which turned out well b/c Mel never been there before, even tho it&#8217;s across the street from her at home! :).
</p>
<p>
Stayed up talking and did the same the next morning/afternoon til DD came to &#8220;retrieve&#8221; me :P. Hopefully, M and S will visit ME next :). That night, I had an interesting dream, in which someone revealed to me what I already &#8220;knew&#8221; in my mind. In reality, as i was revealing my dream the following day to another source, I found out that it was true! Scary&#8230;
</p>
<p>
PS. Praise God! He answered my prayers <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> The professor extended my deadline for my assignments due to textbook problems til next week!</p>
