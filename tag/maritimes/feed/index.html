<p>After talking to Dr. Wu (someone I met last time), I was reminded that I haven&#8217;t been back for 5 years already! I still remember it as if it was only a few years ago.</p>
<p>
Halifax highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li>Friday evening: Josh picked us up from airport and dropped us at <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/aimeili/2572218130/in/set-72157605568882639/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fenwick Hall</a></li>
<li>Saturday: <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/aimeili/2572215844/in/set-72157605568882639/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Peggy&#8217;s cove</a>, <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/aimeili/2571392411/in/set-72157605568882639/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lunenburg</a> (home of the bluenose) for fish &#038; chips lunch, stop at <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/aimeili/2571392899/in/set-72157605568882639/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mahone Bay</a>, romantic dinner at <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/aimeili/2571393293/in/set-72157605568882639/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cut</a> (<a href="http://www.eng.uwaterloo.ca/~sm2wong/IGuessSo.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">with &#8220;paparazzi&#8221;</a>) &#8211; a story may follow another day &#8211; followed by a harbour cruise in a <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/aimeili/2572217900/in/set-72157605568882639/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tall ship</a>.</li>
<li>Sunday: Service at HCCC &#8211; it&#8217;s smaller than I remembered and the only people left that I remembered were Dr. Wu, Josh and Calvin. Josh also hung out with us that day and we spent most of it along the harbour  with <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/aimeili/2571394023/in/set-72157605568882639/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lunch at the Harbourside market</a> then over to Fisherman&#8217;s Cove and <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/aimeili/2572220088/in/set-72157605568882639/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dartmouth</a> for the evening. I haven&#8217;t been to Fisherman&#8217;s Cove before so it was a nice stop. Mich and j.w had <a <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/aimeili/2572219938/in/set-72157605568882639/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lobster</a>. The <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/aimeili/2571397075/in/set-72157605568882639/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Old Burial Grounds</a> were closed (disappointingly since last time, my friends thought it was creepy if I took photos)</li>
<li>Monday: brunch at <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/aimeili/2571396221/in/set-72157605568882639/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Your Father&#8217;s Moustache</a> (pub grub) and after <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/aimeili/2572220520/in/set-72157605568882639/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">around the Citadel</a> and <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/aimeili/2572221492/in/set-72157605568882639/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Public Gardens</a></li>
<li>Halifax weather is unpredictable. The forecast says it&#8217;s hot but it turns out to be quite cool/cold so the next day, I figured it would be the same but it was hot today (thankfully much less humid and sticky than Ontario) and now we&#8217;re as red as a lobster (speaking of which, this time McLobsters weren&#8217;t available until Canada Day &#8211; j.w was sooo disappointed)</li>
<li>The people at the Tim Horton&#8217;s (in the Halifax airport) asked Mich and I if we were Filipinos!</li>
<li>The security guy at YYZ asked us if the sheets where we printed our boarding pass on were math questions &#8211; we told him it was Japanese.</li>
<li>Great WestJet jokes!</li>
</ul>
<p>Perhaps more about these another day <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
