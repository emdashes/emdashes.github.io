								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				When some friends asked me for suggestions for local hiking trails or places for a nice nature walk, I had to pause and use my memory and Google to help[ref]so I guess I can&#8217;t blame them if all they could find was a hike that charged $7 a person to see a waterfall some 40 mins away[/ref]; it can sure be challenge to find suitable ideas.<br />
To be honest, I&#8217;ve always wanted to explore some trails but have only maybe done a few as many of these trails are linear (and goes on for hours or days &#8211; with trail access at varies points) instead of loops, so it feels like there&#8217;s a lot more effort to do them (either doubling back or need to park two cars and shuttle back), but this time of the year is probably one of my favourite times to do nature walks[ref]I call them walks instead of hikes as I&#8217;m used to West Coast terrain[/ref].<br />
<a href="https://flic.kr/p/aCyEwY"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/6052/6320977980_5e41dff727_z.jpg" alt="IMG_9665" width="640" height="426" /></a><br />
So, here are some in KWC for my (and hopefully your) future reference &#8211; most of which I&#8217;ve narrowed down based on distance / time and how scenic or interesting the trail might be:</p>
<h3>Cambridge</h3>
<ul>
<li>Devil&#8217;s Creek Trail</li>
<li><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.raresites.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/seasonal-cliffs-and-alvars-trail-map.png" target="_blank" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=http://i2.wp.com/www.raresites.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/seasonal-cliffs-and-alvars-trail-map.png&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1476758739398000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGXMrMJMVUn2C6gI8iwmhIFpnF7xg" rel="noopener noreferrer">Trails along Blair Road (RARE):</a> the river side one has cliffs and water and a lookout (could extend to a loop); I always want to walk along this one when I drive by it</li>
</ul>
<h3>Kitchener</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.ontariotrails.on.ca/trails/view/homer-watson-park-trail" target="_blank" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=http://www.ontariotrails.on.ca/trails/view/homer-watson-park-trail&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1476758739398000&amp;usg=AFQjCNF5qmFYeWJXYsdUNjwUdrYtYwPILA" rel="noopener noreferrer">Homer Watson Park:</a> a 10-second walk from the car leads me to my favourite spot for a fall photo (one that overlooks the Grand River with coloured trees on either side). I discovered this sometime ago, from hunting around online, as it&#8217;s hidden and tucked away, but I haven&#8217;t actually ventured too far along the trail.&nbsp; Someone has kindly documented a 8km loop if you&#8217;re feeling adventurous or park a car at one end and walk to another parking spot and drive back to get the other car &#8211; ‎<a href="http://www.hember.ca/hikes/HomerWatson/" target="_blank" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=http://www.hember.ca/hikes/HomerWatson/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1476758739398000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHoJqTlz1Ag20rPH1QpbkkUZL0aJA" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://www.hember.ca/hikes/HomerWatson/</a><br />
Or, you can try for a shorter loop: <a href="http://hember.ca/hikes/HomerWatsonDoon/index.html" target="_blank" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=http://hember.ca/hikes/HomerWatsonDoon/index.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1476758739398000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFrPAGylOPdPgrWn2f3M14duu42gA" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://hember.ca/hikes/<wbr>HomerWatsonDoon/</wbr></a></li>

<a href="http://www.walterbeantrail.ca/pioneertower.htm">Pioneer Tower</a>: One access point to the <a href="http://www.walterbeantrail.ca/images/WalterBeanTrail_Map.pdf">Walter Bean Grand River trail</a> is by the Pioneer Tower (an interesting structure on its own, along with the small cemetery nearby) &#8211; from that point, you go by some big houses and then becomes a bit rocky and narrow at times (not stroller friendly, we&#8217;ve tried) before you end up along / walking beside the Grand River and going under the highway 8! It continues on, but that&#8217;s where we turned around last time. Could also Google <a href="http://www.walterbeantrail.ca/ap_kuntz.htm">Kuntz Park</a> for more info.</li>

<figure id="attachment_5351" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5351" style="width: 201px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="wp-image-5351 size-medium" src="http://her.happyhippos.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/1383779_10151786380009888_1366189609_n-201x300.jpg" alt="Turtle sunbathing at Huron Natural Area" width="201" height="300"/><figcaption id="caption-attachment-5351" class="wp-caption-text">Turtle sunbathing at Huron Natural Area</figcaption></figure><br />
<a href="https://www.kitchener.ca/en/livinginkitchener/HuronNaturalArea.asp">Huron Natural Area</a> is my go-to for urban, easy loop walks and nearest to our house (one trail goes around a pond where on a sunny day you can spot turtles sunbathing, and in the fall, the leaves look really nice across the still water). My friends ended up choosing this place, and some told me that they didn&#8217;t even know this place existed before this! (I&#8217;m glad they ended up having a nice leisurely walk)[ref]The same someone also documented a possible 5km and 8km loop:<a href="http://www.hember.ca/hikes/HuronNaturalArea/index.html" target="_blank" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=http://www.hember.ca/hikes/HuronNaturalArea/index.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1476758739398000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEVt9gnOhgms5wwwfWbkDPM1qI1qQ" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://www.hember.ca/hikes/HuronNaturalArea</a>[/ref]</li>
</ul>
<h3>Waterloo/St. Jacobs</h3>
<figure style="width: 500px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a title="IMG_9667" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/aimeili/6320456853/in/album-72157602404604327/" data-flickr-embed="true" data-footer="true"><img src="https://c6.staticflickr.com/7/6110/6320456853_0f1d4eb5d1_n.jpg" alt="Race Mill trail" width="500" height="333"/></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">A Mennonite man walks with two kids across the train trestle</figcaption></figure>
<ul>
<li>Health Valley Trail: This one is a challenge to find it seems but you walk to downtown St Jacobs from Waterloo, so you could have lunch there after!</li>
<li><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>Mill Race trail: in the village of St. Jacobs, goes under a train trestle, a next to a creek in some spots, see some chipmunks or frogs, some farm land, and if you&#8217;re lucky you&#8217;ll also hear gun shots. At the end of the 2km linear trail, you will see a small dam (so it&#8217;s like a mini-waterfall, right?)</li>
<li>The <a href="http://thehydrocut.ca/">Hydrocut</a> (specifically, only the multi-use trail): this might offer a more challenging terrain (enter via the <a href="http://thehydrocut.ca/trails-map">Snyders Road parking lot</a>) ‎but be warned that despite it being a multi-use trail, you may encounter many mountain biking enthusiasts &#8211; as it&#8217;s &#8220;their&#8221; trail around here. And I&#8217;ve been told there&#8217;s plenty of mosquitoes (but I&#8217;d imagine other places w trees and water might too)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.waterloo.ca/en/gettingactive/geotimetrail.asp">GeoTime trail</a>: This 4.5 km one seems like it would be an informative / educational walk vs. a hike &#8211; the concept is kind of neat, and I didn&#8217;t know this existed either; thanks, @jowu!</li>
</ul>
<p>And then, there are walks with a purpose: to <a href="https://fallingfruit.org/?z=16&amp;y=43.43180&amp;x=-80.49604&amp;m=false&amp;t=roadmap&amp;l=true&amp;locale=en&amp;c=forager,freegan">harvest fruit</a> along the pathways!<br />
Are there anymore that are worth checking out?		</p>

<figure id="attachment_5270" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5270" style="width: 150px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/IMG_20160623_073233.jpg"><img class="wp-image-5270 size-thumbnail" src="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/IMG_20160623_073233-150x150.jpg" alt="Photo courtesy of my mother-in-law" height="150" width="150"/></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-5270" class="wp-caption-text">Photo courtesy of my mother-in-law.

Around 6:30 AM one morning, Bean woke up and didn&#8217;t go back to sleep but was content to lie in bed with me. At some point, she told me that something was bothering her at the back of her head (her one-worded summary: &#8220;ow&#8221;), near the nape of her neck. In my sleepy haze, I parted her hair and took a peek. A skin-coloured lump, almost the size of my pinky fingernail, puzzled and troubled me so I tried to get a closer look with a tissue because I didn&#8217;t want to touch it because it looked like it had hair follicles, which also sort of resembled short insect-like legs. So, trying to hide my &#8220;heebies jeebies&#8221;[ref]the &#8220;heebie jeebies&#8221; accurately sums how I feel, as used by one forum poster with his experience[/ref], I asked her if she wanted Daddy or Grandma to come in to help me, and she said Grandma, so I went to get a second opinion. Grandma later told me she took a video and some photos and sent it to a doctor friend of hers, who admitted he didn&#8217;t know what it was, perhaps an insect bite or an infection with a sac. We made an appointment with our family doctor, and I started googling and looking for images of skin tags that matched what I had seen &#8211; nothing that looked that size, even though the description seemed to match.<br />
At the doctor&#8217;s office, the nurse and the doctor took a look and confirmed that it was a skin tag. Her explanation was in line with what I had read online: that they&#8217;re benign, often made of the same cells and components of your skin, so you will see things like hair follicles, and that this one had a stalk. I couldn&#8217;t figure out how I missed it (since I comb her hair daily), but I asked how long it could have been there for, and she explained that it could have been there for awhile but was hard to spot because it wasn&#8217;t bothering Bean. She told us that it look like it was going to auto-amputate because the stalk end/base was starting to turn bluish, so we had a few options:</p>
<ol>
<li>Leave it be, and see how long it would take. Usually for smaller skin tags, it takes 2-3 days, but this one could be slower because of its size.</li>
<li>Use liquid nitrogen to burn it off. I asked how the pain would be compared to a needle, and she said it would probably be the same intensity but longer.</li>
<li>Something similar to #2 but with local freezing. We opted to go with this.</li>
</ol>
<p><figure id="attachment_5269" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5269" style="width: 225px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/715.jpg"><img class="wp-image-5269 size-medium" src="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/715-225x300.jpg" alt="tick-closeup" height="300" width="225" srcset="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/715-225x300.jpg 225w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/715-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/715.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-5269" class="wp-caption-text">Photo courtesy of our doctor</figcaption></figure><br />
For whatever reason, she decided to take a second look, and this time, IT MOVED. I appreciate that she didn&#8217;t freak out, because I would have &#8211; and certainly did inside. Instead, she calmly said that she was going outside to get a second doctor&#8217;s opinion and help. The second doctor was a lot more certain that it was a tick and they partnered to quickly remove it with a pair of tweezers; it was still very much alive in the urine sample jar they put it in, so we assume that every bit came out (thus reducing Lyme disease, if at risk) &#8211; the second doctor must have really wanted to make sure for he must have pulled extra skin and hair off, because Bean started crying even more and I was handed a piece of gauze to apply pressure to stop the bleeding[ref]a week later, the spot looks raised with a dark scab, and it must feel tender because it still bothers her[/ref]. Google helped identify the tick as a dog tick, which isn&#8217;t as great of a threat as the black-legged ticks, but they jarred it anyway to be sent for analysis. She called a contact to see if we needed to start antibiotic treatment, as their guidelines only offered advice to those over 8 years of age. Later, she also followed up to tell us that Public Health would call if they found something of concern and texted us some close-up photos. We don&#8217;t have a dog, but we did go to the urban natural area the day before, and that&#8217;s likely where we picked it up.<br />
I also appreciated that she apologized and retracted her first diagnosis; she had seen ticks before, but none this size[ref]I don&#8217;t blame her &#8211; Google tells me that it was an adult female in its partially fed state so it would be bigger[/ref]. She&#8217;s a family doctor, so I can&#8217;t expect her to know everything, even though we hope they know what ails us. She recognized that even though I had made comments about characteristics reminding me of an insect, it was likely that everyone&#8217;s quick glance assumptions as a skin tag threw everyone off.<br />
<figure id="attachment_5267" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5267" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/20160623_144856_edit.jpg"><img class="wp-image-5267 size-medium" src="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/20160623_144856_edit-300x224.jpg" alt="topview-tickinjar" height="224" width="300" srcset="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/20160623_144856_edit-300x224.jpg 300w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/20160623_144856_edit.jpg 436w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-5267" class="wp-caption-text">Looking from the outside of the jar &#8211; doesn&#8217;t look as big as the close up, nor as creepy as when it was on her head.</figcaption></figure><br />
I like being outdoors. I enjoy aspects of camping, canoeing, and especially hiking; I remember my dad would take us on walks and bike rides around trails when we were much younger. In all my years doing activities outdoors, I would have never imagined having to deal with this. Thankfully, I think this experience was more traumatic for me than it was for Bean, since she didn&#8217;t see what was bothering her, despite some tears and pain.<br />
Thank God that Bean noticed it, and He answered our prayers, giving wisdom to our doctor who for reason decided to do a second&nbsp; look &#8211; because who knows if we would&#8217;ve found it otherwise. Plus, I am really glad that I didn&#8217;t have to remove it myself.		</p>

<p><figure id="attachment_5221" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5221" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="size-medium wp-image-5221" src="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/IMG_20160423_093522-e1462586310284-300x300.jpg" alt="little library materials" height="300" width="300" srcset="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/IMG_20160423_093522-e1462586310284-300x300.jpg 300w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/IMG_20160423_093522-e1462586310284-150x150.jpg 150w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/IMG_20160423_093522-e1462586310284-768x768.jpg 768w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/IMG_20160423_093522-e1462586310284-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/IMG_20160423_093522-e1462586310284-1568x1568.jpg 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-5221" class="wp-caption-text">Little library build, gable-style</figcaption></figure><br />
At the start of the year,&nbsp;I had shared with j.w two of my <del>resolutions</del>[ref]I don&#8217;t believe in resolutions as I don&#8217;t (like to) make promises I can&#8217;t keep[/ref] goals for the year, which he has helped me to meet: make our bed daily (a little step towards to tidiness) and get a little library up and running in our front yard (community).<br />
A community build event took place and j.w put together most of the little library house. To our surprise, we now share another thing in common with our neighbours two houses down: not only do our sons share the same first name, but they also have the same gable-style library that they picked up the same morning!<br />
Sometime this summer, I aim to paint/stain it, seal it, and then put it up with some family-friendly reading, primarily books in the Christian and children genre. While there are plenty of other little libraries with children&#8217;s literature, I wonder what the uptake will be on Christian books. I have other little ideas for it, including maybe a Facebook group to post what&#8217;s available, a NFC check-in tag, as well a QR tag to track the location and review of the books that go through our little library &#8211; those are lofty ideas, so we shall see.</p>
<h3>Waterloo Region Waste Management &#8211; Open House</h3>
<p><figure id="attachment_5222" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5222" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="wp-image-5222 size-medium" src="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/IMG_20160423_122123-300x225.jpg" alt="Recycled material" height="225" width="300" srcset="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/IMG_20160423_122123-300x225.jpg 300w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/IMG_20160423_122123-768x576.jpg 768w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/IMG_20160423_122123-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/IMG_20160423_122123-1568x1176.jpg 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-5222" class="wp-caption-text">Cubes of compacted recycled cans</figcaption></figure><br />
After a morning of building most of the little library, we rushed to the waste management site. I had signed us up to go because of Bean&#8217;s interest in garbage trucks and buses &#8211; a school bus was to take us on a tour of the site, with pauses at the current landfill, and a stop at the recycling centre. If their goal of open houses is to send an environmental message home, I think it achieved it with our family; it probably ended up being the most educational for us, the parents. Here&#8217;s what I learned:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_box_recycling_system#History" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The (now world-wide) blue box recycling program started in Kitchener</a></li>
<li>The waste management site &#8220;hires&#8221; two <a href="http://www.therecord.com/news-story/4260095-this-job-is-for-the-birds/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hawks to send seagulls away</a> a few times a week</li>
<li>Mount Trashmore, our local popular tobogganing hill, was discontinued as a landfill in the &#8217;70s</li>
<li>Landfills that are at max capacity are capped with ceramic before being topped with soil and grass</li>
<li>Items you throw in the garbage that you know are biodegradable or claims to biodegrade in X days won&#8217;t actually ever if it ends up in the landfill because the environment isn&#8217;t right for it; it actually gets packed down (sort of WALL-E-like), so it lacks oxygen and organisms that break it down</li>
<li>A tarp-like sheet goes over every layer of garbage to keep it from blowing away and fumes and moisture are sent through pipes, where the methane gas is collected and converted into energy; I didn&#8217;t see any burning pipes anywhere, nor did it smell nearly as bad as the one we used to drive back next to Highway 1 back home before it got converted to a driving range</li>
</ul>
<p>You could say that we unknowingly took part in some Earth Day weekend activities, with a specific focus on recycling / reusing (books in the community instead of the garbage, and learning about recycling operations in our city). It felt like a long day, but it wasn&#8217;t even mid-afternoon yet by the time we finished! While I do enjoy doing our regular stops, after this past Saturday&#8217;s activities together as a family, I find it&#8217;s worth waking up early if it means doing something different.<br />
Some neat upcoming events in May around #kwawesome that you could do with your family, a date, or friends are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Saturday, May 7, 9-10:30a <a href="http://janeswalk.org/canada/kitchener/lets-have-coffee-or-10/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Coffee walk around Downtown Kitchener (DTK)</a></li>
<li>Sunday, May 8, 2p <a href="http://janeswalk.org/canada/kitchener/spur-line-trail-smile-tiger-berlin-bicycle-cafe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Coffee tour bike-ride on Spur Line Trail</a></li>
<li>Friday, May 27, 6-7p Listening choir DTK (probably not suitable for families with little ones, as they will likely get impatient or lose attention since there&#8217;s no speaking and you stand and appreciate the urban noise) &#8211; other dates are also available</li>
</ul>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				Now that the <a href="http://her.happyhippos.ca/2015/11/things-to-do-in-kw/">adults have ideas on what #kwawesome offers</a>, here&#8217;s a list of no or low-cost drop-in programs that are toddler friendly. While the local libraries, Early Years Centres, and some community centres / associations have great programs for children and caregivers, most of them require registration. I didn&#8217;t take Bean to many programs when she was younger because they were all offered in the morning, which conflicted with her morning nap; now that she&#8217;s just napping in the afternoon, these times work better for us. Drop-in programs are also great for us because it allows flexibility: on low-key days,  or the times we don&#8217;t have the car or the weather isn&#8217;t bussing or walking friendly, we can choose to stay in.<br />
This list is really to help me keep a track of what&#8217;s being offered during the fall and winter terms around us (the start of summer usually means the end of some programs):</p>

<li><strong>Wednesdays:</strong> <em>to be determined, but you can always bring them to The Museum ($5 admission Wednesdays, free for child under 3)<br />
Or join <a href="http://www.ourplacekw.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Early Years Centre for Music and Movement</a> (offered weekdays. Songs with actions and parachute fun), 11:30-noon free (gym open for use prior to program), or <a href="https://creeksidechurch.ca/playground/">Creekside Church indoor playground,</a> 9:30-11:30 AM free (Monday &#8211; Thursday, unstructured free play)</em></li>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>A few nights ago, a friend asked me what there was to do in Kitchener-Waterloo, and how I found out about them. This isn&#8217;t&nbsp;the first time someone has asked for ideas, so I figured a compiled list of what I follow may be helpful to my other self and for future reference &#8211; and even though I don&#8217;t necessarily have time do venture out to many events offered around time, I still try sometimes! So what piques my interest? Generally, I like to know about free/low-cost activities that don&#8217;t need&nbsp;too much&nbsp;commitment.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Here are some of my sources:</div>
<ul>
<li>Meetup groups &#8211; a few that I subscribe to, include:
<ul>
<li>Badminton Fun in KW&nbsp;&#8211; John sends out a reminder of places that offer drop-in badminton around town (mostly at community centres)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.meetup.com/Tri-Cities-Food-Lovers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tri-Cities Food Lovers &#8211;</a> I tend to follow this group for restaurant ideas (haven&#8217;t been to a meetup yet)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.meetup.com/Its-On-Events-for-20s-30s-at-Kitchener-Public-Library/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">It&#8217;s On &#8211; Events for 20s and 30s</a>&nbsp;&#8211; a central place for all the events that Kitchener Public Library offers for a specific crowd, though open to all. Note that registration actually happens on the KPL site itself, and that most of it is just a repeat of what&#8217;s listed on the KPL Events Calendar (but easier to find here).</li>
<li><a href="http://www.meetup.com/Hiking-for-Beginners-in-Cambridge-ON/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hiking for Beginners</a> &#8211; while the group says Cambridge, Ontario, I find that a bunch of the hikes are actually in the Kitchener area. I tend to follow them to discover trails around me as the timing for the meetups hasn&#8217;t been right for me yet.</li>
<li>I also follow the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/KW-Chinese-English-Language-and-Cultural-Exchange/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chinese-English Social Cultural Exchange</a> meetup group to keep a tabs on Chinese eating places around town</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Public Library events
<ul>
<li>I tend to find out about interesting events from the library posters, TV screens, and their <a href="http://www.libraryaware.com/1111/Subscribers/Subscribe?showonlynewsletterlists=true">newsletters</a>;&nbsp;e.g. Etc., Music Notes, KPL News. Popular events that have limited seats tend to fill quickly, and if you end up registering late, you&#8217;ll be added to a waitlist. A few that I&#8217;ve attended include one on <a href="http://her.happyhippos.ca/2015/05/coffee-notes/">coffee</a>, making your own terrarium during #diyfestival,&nbsp; interior design, and an upcoming ones that seem interesting&nbsp;is an&nbsp;art class, an escape room adventure featured for international games day, and a <a href="http://kplca.evanced.info/signup/EventDetails.aspx?EventId=11432&amp;lib=" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DIY string art piece</a>.</li>
<li>You can also <a href="http://kplca.evanced.info/signup/EventCalendar.aspx">filter events in the calendar</a> to browse for ones that interest you (hint: set filters by Date: today&#8217;s date, leave end date open; Event type: Adult, Arts &amp; Culture, Business; Age Group: Adults &#8211; List view). Notably, KPL Central branch offers a weekly free movie&nbsp;screening in their theatre space.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Community Centres / Community Associations tend to offer many classes at a reasonable cost, but they usually require registration and a 8-10 weeks of commitment. I find that I have to browse through the leisure guides physically because&nbsp;the online versions aren&#8217;t very browseable (ref. <a href="http://issuu.com/cityofwaterloo/docs/waterloo_fall2015_web?e=1669671/14829852" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Waterloo</a> / Kitchener). I&#8217;ve noticed that similar classes tend to vary in price depending on where it&#8217;s offered, perhaps because of&nbsp;each community centre&#8217;s surrounding demographics (e.g. Downtown Kitchener seems to have lower drop-in prices than say RIM Park in Waterloo)
<ul>
<li>Cooking classes</li>
<li>Art classes (e.g. $5 a class for drawing)</li>
<li>Language classes (e.g. ASL &#8211; $5+ /class, Spanish, Conversational Chinese &#8211; $5 a class on Saturday mornings)</li>
<li>Social Dance / Ballroom dancing&nbsp;classes, even more affordable than the ones taught at University of Waterloo (outside of&nbsp;the clubs)</li>
<li>Drop-in sport activities &#8211; organized and self-organized, such as badminton (from $3 a session)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://enews.kitchener.ca/enews/signup.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">City of Kitchener</a> and <a href="http://enews.waterloo.ca/mailinglist/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">City of Waterloo</a> newsletters, which include a Kitchener Market sub-newsletter
<ul>
<li>By extension, the <a href="http://www.downtownkitchener.ca/en/index.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Downtown Kitchener BIA </a>also offers a e-newsletter that&nbsp;highlights events such as <a href="http://nightshiftwr.ca/">NightShift</a> and Art Market, and the <a href="http://frederickartwalk.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">annual Art Walk </a>(local artisans featuring their works for sale)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Free <a href="http://www.kitchener.ca/en/livinginkitchener/public_skating_schedule.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">community skating </a>/ <a href="http://www.timhortons.com/ca/en/social/free-swimming.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">swimming / aqua-fit</a> sessions</li>

<li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/arts/alumni-friends" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Arts Alumni Theatre Night &#8211; free, registration required</a>&nbsp;&#8211; productions by current students at UW</li>
<li><a href="http://www.lostandfoundtheatre.com/index.php/ct-menu-item-11/ct-menu-item-13" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lost and Found Theatre &#8211; free nights</a>&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Free academic / public lectures, for the geek-nerds in us, such as:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://perimeterinstitute.ca/outreach/general-public/public-lecture-series" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PI Institute</a>&nbsp;&#8211; I have attended a couple in the past, one on music and physics</li>
<li>University of Waterloo <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/hagey-lectures/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Public Lectures</a> (and any of its affiliated colleges)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Miscellaneous:
<ul>
<li>I really enjoyed the events that Clipped Outdoors offered for women, but they haven&#8217;t been active in a while so I wonder what happened&#8230;</li>
<li>Community events offered by local churches&nbsp;(e.g. canning, community gardening) &#8211; I find out about them usually from their signs as a passerby</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Have any more suggestions or ideas? Leave a comment below.		</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				For two weeks, we had the company of my family with us (minus two). I especially treasured moments between our two-year old and her cousin, who at six months younger, seemed to equal in height and just a bit more solid in terms of weight.<br />
While it seemed like they took some time to get used to the presence of each other, by the end of the visit, they played and interacted with each other without needing any encouragement from us. I now know that Bean is capable of independent play (the adults spent a whole meal eating around the dining table while the two played in the play area)! This visit seemed like they were closer than their time spent in California together, even though that was only a few months prior.<br />
I worried that Bean was going to have some withdrawal, but she seems to be coping it quite well; Mommy might be the one that ends up in withdrawal as she settles us back into a quieter routine that will likely be marked with hibernation tendencies due to the cooler weather.<br />
The two weeks seemed to go by quickly, as each day was packed with an activity, with only one or two days of resting at home. I discovered that it&#8217;s more fun and motivating to do things with others &#8211; and that there is a lot of low to no-cost activities offered here in region! Each day required some flexibility, as we often didn&#8217;t leave the house until past 10:30 or 11am, but nap times were generally around 2:30pm &#8211; sometimes&nbsp;in the car.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Our&nbsp;stay-cation</h3>
<p>Niagara area</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cousin&#8217;s wedding at Creekside Estate Winery</strong>:&nbsp;a&nbsp;lovely&nbsp;intimate evening outdoor wedding,&nbsp;with traditions brought&nbsp;in from the bride and groom&#8217;s culture &#8211; Metis and Chinese (including&nbsp;a&nbsp;tying ceremony and mooncakes). However, I couldn&#8217;t bring myself to try the cheese and crackers&nbsp;that&nbsp;many of the fruit flies feasted on &#8211;&nbsp;they can&#8217;t&nbsp;be avoided at this time of the year because of the grapes they say); we managed to catch the super moon / lunar eclipse!</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://outletcollectionatniagara.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Outlet Collection at Niagara</a></strong>&nbsp;&#8211; I found it to be more spacious with better food selection / food courts&nbsp;than Premium Outlets &#8211; though we managed to squeeze in a 30-minute power shopping stop&nbsp;at those outlets too in Milton on the way to the airport</li>
<li><strong>August 8</strong>: The Golden&nbsp;Lotus buffet at Fallsview charges a ridiculous $16 for a 2-year old (same until 10 years old) even though the adults are $20. <em>How many two year olds can eat the same amount as a ten-year old, or 4/5ths of an adult?&nbsp;</em>I enjoyed the variety and quality of the kitchen (cooked) options. They charge a more reasonable $1.20 per year of the child (free under 2). As it turns out mind you, August 8 pricing is&nbsp;actually more per person than Fallsview (because Lotus includes tax and it&#8217;s lower per adult), so&nbsp;had we gone,&nbsp;Golden Lotus would&#8217;ve saved us at least $16 in the end despite the $16 meal for the 2-year old. Ah well, at least we can say we tried August&nbsp;8 now.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<div>In town</div>
<ul>
<li><strong>Early Years Centre:</strong> Music &amp; Movement scheduled program meant that they participated in some songs and parachute fun. It was C&#8217;s first time, but she wasn&#8217;t shy about it the second time we went; they also had the opportunity to play on the Little Tikes plastic playground&nbsp;items in the open gym&nbsp;and little odds and ends in the Orange Room</li>
<li><strong>Pioneer Park Library: </strong>C was around for our first toy-borrowing experience&nbsp;so she got to play with some new toys with Bean. Bean is now super excited when she sees a new toy from the library.</li>
<li><strong>St. Jacob&#8217;s and Anna Mae&#8217;s</strong> (Millbank): We also checked out the newly rebuilt St. Jacob&#8217;s market on a Thursday, and even though it was a weekday, it was bustling with people and it seemed a lot bigger in general: with vendors outside and inside of three separate buildings! At one booth, the woman remembered me from the Etsy show two weeks ago, and I found out that she sells her&nbsp;Calendula balm was actually $2 cheaper at the market &#8211; and it seemed to be an already reasonable price at the show! ($10 tax in at the market). We managed to catch a filling lunch at Anna Mae&#8217;s, a place my parents actually stumbled upon years back, famous for their broasted chicken and pies.</li>
<li><strong>The Museum:&nbsp;</strong>It was pretty much deserted at the Museum, which allowed ample time and space for them to play and explore. The two probably spent the most time in the infant and toddler area and the boat water station (just playing with the water, not exactly directing the boats downstream). Sadly, the top floor is now more geared for adults as opposed to children &#8211; gone is the sticker and balloon rooms and the science and nutrition stations. Bean enjoyed watching her grandfather flap his arms to a dinosaur game and playing in the color-changing sand pit; she also loved the star show (where we blasted off to many planets, including Jupiter, resulting in her new favourite planet and her frequent reminder asking me, &#8220;Do you remember we went to Jupiter?&#8221;) but C was &#8220;all done&#8221; had to leave&nbsp;shortly after it begun (fear of the dark?).</li>
<li><strong>Waterloo Park (Zoo):&nbsp;</strong>Bean was a lot more hesitant about the animals roaming around behind the fences at Waterloo Park, but C seemed to enjoy them, especially the llamas, since she knows a song about them. It seems like many of the animals seems to have disappeared, leaving behind overgrown and/or empty habitats including the bunnies and pigs.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Shantz Family Farm:&nbsp;</strong>This farm is just five minutes down the road from us &#8211; I don&#8217;t know why we haven&#8217;t gone to it before as everything, including the corn maze is free. The two girls loved the plastic play toys (Little Tikes houses and slides) &nbsp;in the children&#8217;s straw maze area and Bean had a great time with accessible banana seat swings (as opposed to the diaper seats). When we visited on a weekday, it looked abandoned but this past Thanksgiving Monday, it was bustling with families &#8211; what a contrast! Bean was afraid of the animals during her first visit, but seemed to warm up to them to the point of wanting to watch and &#8220;feed&#8221; them on Thanksgiving Monday.</li>
<li><strong>Kitchener Market&nbsp;</strong>for Saturday produce and bacon shopping, iced pineapple tea and breadbaron, with a side visit to the Asian supermarket down the street. The children&#8217;s program was a bit too advanced for the two kids but they tried to glue a fall wreath together anyway.</li>
<li><strong>Oktoberfest:&nbsp;</strong>Because their visit coincided with the beginning of Oktoberfest, we took a trip downtown to check out the street vendors and happened to wander into Hockeytown instead. I thought it was a bit strange that Oktoberfest was so hockey-fied and thought maybe they were sponsors until I later learned that they were two different events in the same area. I think we enjoyed hockeytown more as they had more kid-friendly activities and freebies (including a free jersey for children under 16!).</li>
<li><strong>Stratford &#8211; The Sound of Music:&nbsp;</strong>The grandparents and j.w lovingly stayed at home to babysit while the sisters had a date to see the Sound of Music in Stratford (40 min leisurely drive &#8211; it seems like a lot shorter drive than 40 minutes on the&nbsp;401 towards Toronto for some reason), thanks to a Groupon-advertised $40 deal. We sat a row apart, next to the sound booth, but the view was great and the sound booth wasn&#8217;t much of a distraction &#8211; other than me noticing that the guy had the script and music score of the entire play in a binder and would be following along (though at times, he had to catch up a few pages); I do wonder if the AV guy has memorized most of it by now or is bored from seeing it over and over. My short review as posted on Facebook:<br />
<blockquote><p>Wasn&#8217;t sure it was worth seeing the Sound of Music twice, but it was different enough and surprisingly, I enjoyed Stratford&#8217;s version more than Toronto&#8217;s &#8211; the key characters were believable, and I welcomed the comic relief (Max and the &#8220;cowboys&#8221; as referenced in the review &#8211; one vignette coincided well with Oktoberfest). If you have time before the season ends, go catch it!</p>

<p>When dining out, we celebrated my sister&#8217;s birthday at Dels and treated my mom to the westernized version of pig ears (fried and savoury sweet) at Fork and Cork Grill. We also managed two lunch visits to Mikey&#8217;s and shared some deep-fried tofu (they previously liked) and introduced them to their version of iced lemon tea, beef brisket noodle soup and condensed milk HK style french toast! j.w also took everyone to SOS BBQ for his favourite in town fish and chips, Downtown Crepe Cafe for cappuccino and crepes, Seven Shores for cappuccino and café mocha (my fave place for the latter), and to breadbaron for our family favourite sandwich place (ms piggy! though porksgiving is another fav of mine too when they don&#8217;t offer ms piggy). In Mississauga, we tried to visit the recommended Grand Chinese Cuisine, but it was closed to a private wedding reception (though my mother thinks that was a good thing as we found out later that a noodle dish is regularly $18!) so we ended up at Royal Jasmine (very salty but that&#8217;s all I know near the 401) and Phoenix (not to be confused with the chain in GTA), a HK style café which had great baked pork chop on fried rice and other good ha-ng-cha dishes overall!<br />
If you&#8217;re a friend on Facebook, we&#8217;ve posted a <del>few</del> number of photos of them together.</p>
<h3>Developmental progress</h3>
<div>Bean has picked up a few sayings and mannerisms from her cousin (and vice versa) and now sings a version of Veggie Tales&#8217; &#8220;where is my hairbrush&#8221; and Sesame Street&#8217;s &#8220;brush your teeth&#8221; song and says &#8220;nope&#8221; and &#8220;yep&#8221; in addition to her usual &#8220;no&#8221; and &#8220;yeah&#8221;;&nbsp;the strangest one yet seems to be her regression in being toilet&nbsp;trained&nbsp;for&nbsp;#2. She used to tell us when she needed to go but&nbsp;a few days into their visit, she actually went in her diaper (and didn&#8217;t tell me and even when I asked, she didn&#8217;t seem bothered), and even now, she ends up with a funny look (with her poking or picking her nose?!) while on occasion with some crying. When she does acknowledge that she needs to go, and I ask her about it, she tells me she needs to pee too (which she does&#8230;which I guess&nbsp;that&#8217;s progress to a degree!)</div>

<div>
 Their way of saying goodbye!

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				Tomorrow marks the last day of this challenge and it sure wasn&#8217;t easy being constrained to being intentionally local, especially when others around you aren&#8217;t. The most frequently asked questions were, &#8220;<em>is this [considered] local?</em>&#8221; and &#8220;<em>why are you doing this?</em>&#8221;<br />
The second question is a bit easier to answer: aside from the <a href="http://www.baileyslocalfoods.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">free year&#8217;s membership to Baileys Local</a> and to support and participate with the community, I wanted to see if it would take a lifestyle change to live locally. With only a day to go (and $12 for cheating between the two of us, the biggest culprit for us being online entertainment like streaming and reading non-local blogs and eating), I&#8217;ve concluded that being exclusively local can be easy in some ways, but it would not work long-term for us if we had to do it day in and day out. T&#8217;was not for naught though, as we happened upon a few new discoveries along the way (<a title="#livelocalkw: Coffee &amp; The Great Outdoors" href="http://her.happyhippos.ca/2014/09/livelocalkw-coffee-the-great-outdoors/#comments" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@SKL</a> &#8211; this part is for you!): a place that sells beeswax (for my baking experiment that will hopefully happen), <a href="http://ambrosiapastry.com/about-us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a shop that sells <span class="st">canelés</span> (!)</a>, <a href="http://www.baileyslocalfoods.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">one more online option to order local/organic food</a>, and the manager that ran the sushi and sandwiches at the now-defunct Casa Mia is selling sushi (and other items) at the Y Café at the CIGI campus beside it (so not all is lost!)!<br />
In our quest to stay local this week, we discovered that not everyone defines local the way we do;&nbsp; for example, a well-intending parent tried to convince us that Ontario corn and carrots bought at a Walmart in Toronto counts as being &#8220;local&#8221;, and while Ontario-grown produce is great, Walmart is far from being local on my list, even if it had been bought at the Walmart in KW and even if Walmart employs staff that are from the city.<br />
And while there are plenty more great places around town to eat, shop, and play local, the following three ties up this blog series:</p>
<h3>Eat</h3>
<p>Generally speaking, I don&#8217;t like paying for cold sandwiches (or grapes, honeydew, cantaloupe, muffins, veggies that can be found on a veggie tray, har gow or siu mai) &#8211; this likely stems from eating deli sandwiches for lunch throughout most of primary and secondary school because our family owned a soup and sandwich restaurant and catering business (har gow, siu mai from daily dim sum lunches with the grandparents while in HK). However, I still enjoy hot sandwiches and the occasional cold ones &#8211; usually ones that don&#8217;t have deli meat in them.&nbsp;<br />
I especially like the housemade bacon-based sandwiches made at <a href="http://breadbaron.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">breadbaron</a>, a take-out stand that took over <a href="http://indulgekitchen.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Indulge Kitchen</a> at the Kitchener Market, but they cycle through a few sandwiches every so often, which makes sense as they can ensure fresh ingredients and do it well. . One perk is that after you order one sandwich, they give you a $1 off coupon to be used on a subsequent purchase there!</p>
<h3>Shop</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/Steckle/photos/a.152547468193790.30913.121778541270683/631374770311055/?type=1&amp;theater"></a> Steckle&#8217;s produce stand (Photo: Facebook)<br />
Well, since this is the last of the series, here are three other places apart from the typical supermarket chains that we buy our fridge and freezer food from:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.stecklehomestead.ca" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steckle Heritage Farm</a> when in season, sells their farm-grown veggies and root vegetables. Last year they had a novel concept where you just pay what you can or what you feel like it&#8217;s worth, but this year, they seem to have priced their harvest reasonably (and pay by honour system).&nbsp; The produce stand just sits near the entrance and is open to the public on Tuesdays between 3-7pm</li>
<li>Sustainable360.ca doesn&#8217;t require a membership fee (unlike Bailey&#8217;s) and while the selection isn&#8217;t as vast as Bailey&#8217;s, they do offer products that Bailey&#8217;s doesn&#8217;t sell and on par or cheaper than its online and in-store competitors (I&#8217;ve compared blueberries from the same farm, same volume, and it was $1 cheaper here than Bailey&#8217;s)</li>
<li>and a honorable mention to <a href="http://www.caudlescatchseafood.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Caudle&#8217;s Catch</a> &#8211; because I miss the seafood from Vancouver. Seafood isn&#8217;t local, but they do sell quality seafood, including wild-caught fish from the Great Lakes in addition to a variety of other farmed and wild fish (and other frozen and fresh seafood). While they are not swimming in a tank like Asian supermarkets, they get shipments weekly and they often look fresher than the dying fish in those tanks anyway; they will also gut and clean/scale the fish for you in store, and can cut up a whole fish for you the way you like it, if you give them a day or two notice (e.g. filets and steaks)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Play</h3>
<p>I love that our library is not just about books:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can borrow books, movies, even video games!</li>
<li>I can use our city libraries without having to leave the house. How?
<ul>
<li>The Kitchener library system lets you download unlimited e-books, magazines to keep, two songs to keep twice a month, and lets you stream movies (twice a month)</li>
<li>You can search online for an item (from both cities) and place a hold on it to be delivered to your preferred library for pick-up (but you need to return the item to a library of the city it belongs)</li>
<li>They email you when your item is ready to be picked up and when upcoming items are due back</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The beauty of our libraries is that you can get both a Kitchener and a Waterloo library card</li>
<li>Aside from parking and fines, all their services are free!</li>
<li>Programs, films, talks, including family-friendly activities</li>
<li>Media space and use of a 3D printer (limited to 3hrs a day)</li>
</ul>
<p>&#8212;<br />
Well, I hope you enjoyed this series. Maybe you&#8217;ll consider taking up this challenge sometime or check out some of these places too if you haven&#8217;t already?<br />

				<description><![CDATA[One of the great things about living in Kitchener-Waterloo is that you don&#8217;t need to go far to eat, shop, or play.

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				One of the great things about living in Kitchener-Waterloo is that you don&#8217;t need to go far to eat, shop, or play. Perhaps it is partly because of this that one of friends can say that Waterloo isn&#8217;t about the scenery or the pretty buildings, but about the community that brings the people and the city together (I&#8217;m glad that others have come to <a title="Talent Attraction Lab" href="http://her.happyhippos.ca/2011/11/talent-attraction-lab/">this same conclusion</a>).<br />
Yesterday, the little one and I deviated from her regular routine and instead of a morning nap; we headed over to our neighbourhood community centre to play with toys and make new friends.&nbsp; Today, I participated in a free, lively workshop (hosted by Employment Ontario) about money saving ideas in and around town and was inspired by other like-minded people who have even better methods of saving money / finding a good deal (so I&#8217;m not the only crazy one out there <a href="http://bec4-beyondthepicketfence.blogspot.ca/2012/05/pallet-bench-tutorial.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">who wants to turn a palette into a furniture piece!</a> sadly, I don&#8217;t have any tools nor have I the woodworking experience).<br />
In this morning&#8217;s daily #livelocalkw email, we were asked, <em>how do you feel about your community when you eat, shop, and play local?</em>&nbsp; Aside from being able to support the livelihood of those in the community, by being intentional, the faces around you eventually become people you know instead of strangers who you may only interact with once or twice (or maybe not&nbsp; at all for those transactions done over a screen).<br />
Today&#8217;s picks:</p>
<h3>Eat</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/aromacafewaterloo/photos/a.215748145251734.1073741828.174792352680647/284505125042702/?type=1&amp;theater"></a> Aroma Cafe&#8217;s Bibimbap (Photo: Aroma Cafe, Facebook)<br />
Uptown Waterloo&#8217;s <a href="https://www.facebook.com/aromacafewaterloo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Aroma Café</a>, <em>not</em> to be confused with the Toronto-based Aroma Espresso Bar franchise chain, is a small coffee shop that is tucked away in the upstairs of the building beside Angie&#8217;s Kitchen. But don&#8217;t think that it&#8217;s just another &#8220;coffee&#8221; shop; Kiki, the owner, is super-friendly and aside from making their own blends of coffee beans (which they discount off every few days to keep their supply fresh), I love that she puts her own twist in traditional Korean bibimbap, using atypical ingredients like beets, turnip, avocado, and alfalfa sprouts so that the dish tastes super fresh and is full of &#8220;gourmet&#8221; vegetables. I&#8217;ve concluded that any of her Korean-style takes are simply delicious, because her rice cakes and kalbi pockets were tasty too.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Shop</h3>
<p>One of our regular weekly destinations to shop on Saturdays is the Kitchener Market. We go to get locally grown vegetables, eggs, and other good (non-local) deals. We also find that the average price at this market cheaper than the one in St. Jacob&#8217;s, perhaps it is because it feels less touristy and has fewer vendors. Like the St. Jacob&#8217;s market, many vendors will also mark down their fresh food to clear their stock by the end of the day (10 minutes prior closing, which is around 2pm).</p>
<h3>Play</h3>
<p>Community associations/centres and recreation complexes provide quality programs at affordable prices; for instance, the caregiver + tot drop-in down the street from us costs $1 each time we go.&nbsp; Depending on the community association, you can find a range of offerings, from fitness and sports like <a href="http://www.kitchener.ca/en/livinginkitchener/Lyle_Hallman_Walking_Track.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">indoor running tracks</a> (free!), badminton and ballroom dancing to art and cooking classes. Our neighbourhood association even throws a yearly party for the community, bringing live entertainment, music, and bouncy castles!<br />
Even if you&#8217;re not participating this challenge, how do <em>you</em> feel when you eat, shop, or play local?		</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				We&#8217;ll be donating a few toonies by the end of the week (e.g. caught myself snacking on a Cliff Mojo Dark Chocolate bar from Costco &#8211; which are 1/2 the price of retail btw!), but in our quest to find local food today, we ended up touching on the topic of how far is considered local? I think we&#8217;ve concluded that not enough is locally grown (whether of feasibility because of climate or other reasons). For instance, we drove to Herrles Market, a local farm known for its corn and strawberries among other product, but it is in Wilmot. And how about fruit? Even though we&#8217;re ordering from local co-ops, their fruit is tree-run from the Niagara region. Or avocados. Or vineyard wine.<br />
Today&#8217;s local find? Free mulch (chips) and dirt at the local dump (Waterloo Region Waste Management: Gate 2, open until 4pm on weekdays). We took a recycling bin&#8217;s worth and our garden has a nice new layer of mulch now (saving $ from having to buy non-local from a hardware store or gardening centre).<br />
By featuring a few of my favourite spots this week, perhaps you&#8217;ll end up calling them yours too if you&#8217;re in this area. What are some of your favourites?<br />
Today&#8217;s picks:</p>
<h3>Eat</h3>
<p><figure style="width: 320px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/aimeili/sets/72157626912574894/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5310/5810465205_30732de305_n.jpg" alt="" height="200" width="320"/></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Uptown21</figcaption></figure><br />
Uptown21, or the long-form <a href="http://uptown21.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nat and Nick&#8217;s Uptown 21</a> for their <a title="Uptown21: Tapas Tuesdays" href="http://her.happyhippos.ca/2011/06/uptown21-tapas-tuesdays/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tapas Tuesdays</a> and #brownbagfridays.&nbsp; This restaurant features in-season ingredients that are sourced locally, and the couple that runs it came from Hannah&#8217;s Bella Bistro (don&#8217;t recall the food, but vaguely recall a &#8220;date&#8221; there!); the people there have influenced other successful ventures (e.g. West of Seoul food truck, MPC Public / MamaPapa Catering Co., TacoFarm)<br />
If you&#8217;re an adventurous eater, they determine what they serve on those days (so you can&#8217;t choose). Make a reservation at Uptown21 for their AYCE tapas &#8211; for $35 they&nbsp; keep the tapas coming until you say stop. And don&#8217;t forget about the dessert tapas too!<br />
For #brownbagfridays, it&#8217;s local, made in-house, and a great deal at $5 tax in (take-out only). The line up starts before noon, even though they only serve from noon until they run out. Keep an eye out on <a href="https://twitter.com/nnuptown21" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">their twitter account</a> for their weekly feature, especially for their fried chicken sandwiches &#8211; they are amazing! Oh, and don&#8217;t forget to bring a mug for their (iced) tea of the day, which is also included in the $5 price.</p>
<h3>Shop</h3>
<p>Most of our friends knows that we have a good collection of board games. Most of it comes from <a href="http://www.jjcards.com/shop/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">J&amp;J Superstore</a> (we know it as J&amp;J&#8217;s, and they sell great toys too! and yes, MTG cards to those so inclined). We find their prices quite reasonable as well (though others have told me that <a href="http://www.greatboardgames.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">German Boardgames</a>, a local business that used to be run from some guy&#8217;s basement, has better pricing especially when you buy a lot of games in a year).<br />
(So why pay $5 to play at board game cafés &#8211; which have popped up recently around here, when you can play our place &#8211; how about instead of us charging you $5, you just bring us some food? Though you could borrow some as well).</p>
<h3>Play</h3>
<p>Speaking of local dumps, <a href="http://www.kitchener.ca/en/livinginkitchener/MclennanPark.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">McLennan Park</a> is a family favourite, especially in the winter. This was the old local dump that has converted into a park, which is (not-so-)affectionly known as Mount Trashmore. It&#8217;s conveniently close to us and features a great splash pad, dirt / mountain bike challenges (haven&#8217;t tried), and in the winter, Mount Trashmore itself is a great hill for toboganning adventures, but beware of the steep and long runs &#8211; we&#8217;ve seen paramedics called to the scene at the bottom of the hill.<br />
&lt;warning: choppy video below &#8211; not for those who get motion sick watching choppy videos&gt;<br />

&#8212;<br />
Speaking of adventures, we haven&#8217;t been to the newest in-person game fad that I remember as a 2D computer game &#8211;&nbsp; Adventure Room, where you need to solve puzzles to get out of a locked room!<br />

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				We&#8217;re taking part of <a href="http://livelocalkw.wordpress.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#livelocalkw</a>, a challenge to eat, shop, and play locally for one week. I hesitated on signing up to take on the challenge, as I knew that it wasn&#8217;t going to be easy and I didn&#8217;t want to be held accountable. Sure, our family shops at the market weekly, tend to choose locally-based restaurants when eating out, and stay in the area for most activities, but we don&#8217;t make a conscious effort to restrict our choices to being local only. With groceries, we tend to focus on prices and convenience, which when &#8216;local&#8217; isn&#8217;t always the cheapest or in season. But the <a href="http://www.baileyslocalfoods.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$20 membership to Baileys Local</a> for <a href="http://livelocalkw.wordpress.com/participating-people/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#livelocalkw participants</a> was the motivating incentive to push us forward, so we&#8217;ve signed up and have had lively discussions with each other on <a href="http://livelocalkw.wordpress.com/2014/08/18/what-does-local-mean-to-you/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">what is considered &#8216;local</a>&#8216;, with questions from whether social networking and blogging need to be on a hiatus, to whether our house is truly local because of the materials that were used to build it, but I think we&#8217;ve settled on being local-minded as much as possible, so for me, no online shopping on Amazon or streaming non-locally based YouTube or Netflix videos for example, but we can still take part in conversations online with folks around town and to share about our progress. And <a href="http://livelocalkw.wordpress.com/faq/#people" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">if we cheat, we&#8217;ll give $2 towards Foodlink Waterloo Region</a><br />
So this week, I&#8217;ll feature some places that I enjoy going to eat, shop, and play (even though they may not be a <a href="http://livelocalkw.wordpress.com/participating-businesses/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">participating business</a> for the challenge). Will you consider joining us this week as well? <a href="http://livelocalkw.wordpress.com/participating-people/#signup" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">It&#8217;s not too late to sign up!</a><br />
Here are the first three:</p>
<h3>Eat</h3>
<p> Coffee &amp; treats at DVLB (Photo: Emily L)<br />
We&#8217;ve had delicious home-cooked meals with local lamb chops, lamb meatballs, and spiced chicken with local swiss chard, kale, bacon, butternut squash and beans as sides thus far, but when it comes to eating out, one of my favourite coffee shops around is<a href="http://www.dvlb.ca" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> DVLB (short for Death Valley&#8217;s Little Brother)</a> &#8211; they make some fantastic coffee (including espresso-based drinks and even hot chocolate, and for those who have only been drinking Starbucks/McDonald&#8217;s/etc., don&#8217;t expect them to be syruped or necessarily big in size), and their desserts and pastries are great complements. I also really like the atmosphere as well, with repurposed wooden tables and cycled artwork on the walls.</p>
<h3>Shop</h3>
<p><a href="http://advguide.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Adventure Guide </a>is my go-to for quality outdoor gear. The team at Adventure Guide knows their stuff, and most of the time, they are happy to help you and answer any questions you have, even if it&#8217;s not related to their products (like, how do you keep an infant warm when camping?). They also rent out some great equipment for reasonable prices as well.<br />
Twice a year, they wake up early and put on a fantastic sale for members. Sadly, one can only get so many shoes ($40) and jackets (70% off) before you have too many and need to stop buying the great deals &#8211; because they are quality products, they don&#8217;t typically wear out that fast either! Clothing and other miscellaneous items are often bundled into the sale as well. And the best part is that membership is only $10 for a lifetime and you get points from all purchases (even from the sales) that you can eventually use to redeem on future purchases.</p>
<h3>Play</h3>
<p> Turtle in the sun at Huron Natural Area (Photo: Emily L)<br />
Maintained by the City of Kitchener, <a href="http://www.kitchener.ca/en/livinginkitchener/HuronNaturalArea.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Huron Natural Area</a>, is an urban trail park that is conveniently close to us. Seems like the trails are accessible throughout the year (even with a stroller), whether in snow, rain or sun. I especially enjoy watching the turtles bask in the sun, but we&#8217;ve also seen and heard many frogs there too!<br />
