								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				While he was very stoic and mono-expression before, Little Brother is becoming quite the character, is generous with his smiles, and has quite the appetite.[ref]despite not going up to a week, sometimes! :([/ref]<br />
Some things he enjoys:</p>
<ul>
<li>he prefers soft veggies like squashes over green leafy vegetables (too stringy / fibrous), all soft meat &#8211; chicken, pork, but not steak, fish, and almost all fruits, especially oranges[ref]portion-wise, he eats the same amount as his sister now, if not more![/ref]</li>
<li>looking at the world upside down</li>
<li>studying younger babies</li>
<li>shrieking in laughter, especially when his sister eggs him on</li>
<li>plunking at keys (computer and piano keyboards)</li>
<li>building with Lego and cars (more so than his sister did, but maybe because his sister is more interested in them now)</li>
<li>looking at pictures in books, especially when on the toilet (he asks for them by pointing to where they are stored)</li>
<li>sneaking up the stairs (while we were unaware), climbing and standing on chairs (probably seeing his sister do that) &#8211; he&#8217;s definitely less cautious than his sister &#8211; maybe a combination of being a boy, a second-child, and his own personality differences</li>
<li>helping mommy unload the dishwasher &#8211; cutlery is his forte, though sometimes he will &#8220;help&#8221; unload his cup by doing quality control on it first and pretending to drink from it</li>
<li>playing with water, especially when washing his hands</li>
<li>toddling around (now that he&#8217;s walking around with a lot more confidence)</li>
</ul>
<p>Month 14 and 15 seemed pretty significant:</p>
<ul>
<li>he took his first unassisted steps at around the 14 month mark (2 months sooner than his sister)</li>
<li>2 week long cold/flu, where he spat up a couple of times, but it coincided when our house was sick last year as well</li>
<li>at his check-up, he weighed in as being on the 25th percentile (5x his sister!), around 50th percent in height, but 70th in head circumference (<em>not my genes!</em>); the doctor did comment that they are actually more interested in head circumference than length since a spike in the head size curve could mean a tumor or something unusual in there</li>
<li>figuring out how to drink properly from a sippy cup (and turning it over and tapping liquid from the unsealed ones all over the tray)</li>
<li>&#8220;painting&#8221;[ref]using a brush and water to bring color in a magic book[/ref] for the first time</li>
<li>mommy feeding him mixed nut butter (no peanuts) with no reaction the first time, but breaking out in hives and redness that required two doses of Benadryl to calm it down &#8211; <em>sigh</em>, more allergens to watch out for.</li>
</ul>
<p>The doctor says that he&#8217;s supposed to say about 20 words by now, but while he&#8217;s not there yet (probably 3-4 words he says independently), his vocabulary seems to have exploded over the past two months. Resignedly, many of them are in English (sigh) as he&#8217;s picking up what his sister often says:</p>
<ul>
<li>babbling, with first words at 14 months that seem to be associated with a meaning, but often copied instead of independently said, like &#8220;bao bao&#8221; (bread, but I realize that his meaning actually encompasses all food), &#8220;wow&#8221;, &#8220;POP&#8221; (goes the weasel), <em>mum mum</em> (food, not me) and now it extends to ow, snack, <em>woh woh </em>(dog), <em>mao mao </em>(cat)</li>
<li>signing more (food) by tapping all his fingers together, like in a teepee</li>
<li><em>nein nein</em>: wants mommy&#8217;s milk (that&#8217;s how he greets me now too, not mama &#8211; I&#8217;ve been reduced to breastmilk, sigh)</li>
<li><em>ma ma</em> (paternal grandmother) (15 months) paired with <em>yeh yeh</em> (paternal grandfather), which he had started calling long before <em>ma ma</em></li>
<li>using certain actions for certain songs, at certain parts of songs (like lifting his arms &#8220;when they&#8217;re up they&#8217;re up&#8221; for Grand Ol&#8217; Duke of York)</li>
<li>plays word games by repeating after you like counting from 1-5, but only saying 1 or 5 repeatedly: him: <em>YUT, </em>me: <em>yee, sam, say, </em>him: <em>NG; </em>sometimes he just says 5 or 1 before we even get there</li>
<li>he also understands what you say, like go get the ball, but even when you&#8217;re not talking to him (such as if I said to his sister, go wash your hands, he suddenly decides he wants to be done with his meal too, or I talk about shoes and he goes and grabs some)</li>
</ul>
<p>A bittersweet stage: <em>our little boy is growing up!</em>		</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				Continuing on the theme of two, and just before&nbsp;the second month of the year, Bean reached two and a half, and here&#8217;s what she&#8217;s been learning (play-based):</p>
<h3>Language</h3>
<p>In under two playdates with a 4-year old, her English vocabulary and frequency of use&nbsp;has exploded; now, it&#8217;s almost as if her English switch gets turned on as soon as she steps into her play area. Whether she use words in the right context, or put together nonsensical sentences or words which I know is her attempt at English, she isn&#8217;t afraid to try &#8211; and persist when we don&#8217;t understand her. When she first&nbsp;started speaking (signing and Cantonese), we understood her &#8211; it was almost as if she saved up all she learned before speaking, so this babbling is new to us! I&#8217;m certain she understands more than she can express, which generally happens when one learns a new language; it&#8217;s easier to pick up a language when reading and listening than speaking and writing.<br />
As I listen to her speak more and more English day after day (which I worry she might soon forget her Chinese), I wonder how much more quickly we would pick up a language if we adults approached language learning that way: not being afraid to just go for it even when you might not make sense.<br />
For some of&nbsp;her Cantonese, sometimes I can tell who she has&nbsp;picked it up from based on the words&nbsp;she uses. For example, if I hear &#8220;啜筒&#8221; (<em>zyut tung</em>), I know it&#8217;s from Joseph and his side of the family, because I say &#8220;飲筒&#8221; (<em>yum tung</em>); likewise with &#8220;裡<span class="hps">頭</span>&#8221; (<em>lui tou</em>), I say &#8220;裏邊/面&#8221; (<em>lui bian/mian</em>) instead.</p>
<h3>Music</h3>
<p>She still enjoys singing songs and will spontaneously break out in song all day long, especially ones with actions &#8211; either ones that she&#8217;s been singing at Music and Movement, the library, or ones I&#8217;ve been teaching&nbsp;her &#8211; so I am&nbsp;trying o find Christian songs that are easy to learn in Cantonese to pass on (so far, I&#8217;ve managed <em>Jesus Loves Me</em> with 2 missing words, and parts of two other songs I sang in my childhood).</p>
<h3>Colours and Letters</h3>
<p><figure id="attachment_5122" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5122" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img width="300" height="283" class="wp-image-5122 size-medium" alt="" src="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_20160215_125204-e1455831667444-300x283.jpg" srcset="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_20160215_125204-e1455831667444-300x283.jpg 300w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_20160215_125204-e1455831667444-768x725.jpg 768w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_20160215_125204-e1455831667444-1024x966.jpg 1024w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_20160215_125204-e1455831667444-1568x1480.jpg 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-5122" class="wp-caption-text">Letter search and first time colouring within the lines, independent of help</figcaption></figure><br />
She&#8217;s also at the point where she will make and remember associations, so I&#8217;ve found success with helping her identify colours and alphabet letters, although sometimes, she will just say &nbsp;the association, like &#8220;Daddy&#8221; instead of &#8220;D&#8221; &#8211; but I know that she recognizes that letter now, because she says the same association every time.&nbsp;Other letters she recognizes is O, &#8220;Breanna&#8221; or &#8220;Baby&#8221; B, &#8220;mama&#8221; E (maybe because&nbsp;of&nbsp;my name?), &#8220;doggie-bone&#8221; I,&nbsp;sometimes &#8220;moon-crescent&#8221; C and &#8220;snake&#8221; S, &nbsp;and consistently &#8220;Leia P&#8221; (but it&#8217;s really an A). This opens up new activities to try, such as at&nbsp;restaurants, instead of doing word search on the kids menu, we do letter search.<br />
For colours, we&#8217;ve progressed from doggie brown to sunshine yellow and fire engine red &#8211; and she just somehow knows the colour green, so it&#8217;s her favourite colour of the moment. She can sometimes also identify cloud/blueberry blue, purple and pink. With her new-found love for green, she has also begun to collect objects of the same colour and sort them.</p>
<h3>Doing</h3>
<p><figure id="attachment_5133" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5133" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img width="300" height="225" class="wp-image-5133 size-medium" alt="IMG_20151101_105810" src="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_20151101_105810-300x225.jpg" srcset="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_20151101_105810-300x225.jpg 300w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_20151101_105810-768x576.jpg 768w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_20151101_105810-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_20151101_105810-1568x1176.jpg 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-5133" class="wp-caption-text">Threading pipe cleaners</figcaption></figure><br />
She has started to assert more independence (which often leads to doing especially when told not to do), or wanting to do more things on her own, so I&#8217;ve asked her to help me get a diaper and wipe when changing her brother, pick out her table setting and bring it to the table at meal times, (re)wash her bib after she&#8217;s done with it, and let her figure out how to put on a pair of elastic-waist pants and bite my tongue when it ends up being backwards.<br />
<figure id="attachment_5135" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5135" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img width="300" height="225" class="wp-image-5135 size-medium" alt="Button practice" src="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_20151129_104155-300x225.jpg" srcset="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_20151129_104155-300x225.jpg 300w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_20151129_104155-768x576.jpg 768w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_20151129_104155-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_20151129_104155-1568x1176.jpg 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-5135" class="wp-caption-text">Button practice</figcaption></figure><br />
I know many children at this age can put on clothes, socks, jackets, etc. but we haven&#8217;t mastered those skills yet. Toilet-training is also slow progress &#8211; some days she knows and will tell me she needs to go, and other days, she is happy to pee in her training underwear and not care or seem to notice the couch has gotten wet (still thankful she self-trained for poop for over a year now).<br />
<figure id="attachment_5134" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5134" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img width="300" height="248" class="wp-image-5134 size-medium" alt="Threading O-shaped cereal" src="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_20151101_112247-e1455856139231-300x248.jpg" srcset="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_20151101_112247-e1455856139231-300x248.jpg 300w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_20151101_112247-e1455856139231-768x636.jpg 768w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_20151101_112247-e1455856139231-1024x848.jpg 1024w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_20151101_112247-e1455856139231-1568x1298.jpg 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-5134" class="wp-caption-text">Threading O-shaped cereal</figcaption></figure><br />
Meals are still spent half self-feeding, with help from an adult once she gets bored with self-feeding (or isn&#8217;t as hungry anymore), especially with food choices that aren&#8217;t as easy to self feed because it requires utensils or may be messier, like soup noodles or rice with <em>soong</em>; she can pretty much eat an entire sandwich or a serving of sushi rolls on her own though.<br />
<figure id="attachment_5136" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5136" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img width="300" height="277" class="wp-image-5136 size-medium" alt="scissors-fun" src="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_20160124_103106-e1455855963415-300x277.jpg" srcset="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_20160124_103106-e1455855963415-300x277.jpg 300w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_20160124_103106-e1455855963415-768x708.jpg 768w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_20160124_103106-e1455855963415-1024x944.jpg 1024w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_20160124_103106-e1455855963415-1568x1446.jpg 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-5136" class="wp-caption-text">Attempting to cut on the line with a pair of blunt scissors</figcaption></figure><br />
When it comes to art and drawing, she&#8217;s starting to be able to trace around objects and the other day, she coloured within the lines &#8211; we have yet to find out if that was an accident or not. She is starting to cut by following lines with scissors and thread objects through a pipe cleaner, but she&#8217;s not at the point where she does it repeatedly / enjoys it yet.&nbsp;<br />
This afternoon&#8217;s&nbsp;blog post is brought to you by the peace and quiet of two children napping away, a first! Will report back at three; hope it&nbsp;won&#8217;t be&nbsp;the terrifying threes.		</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				For two weeks, we had the company of my family with us (minus two). I especially treasured moments between our two-year old and her cousin, who at six months younger, seemed to equal in height and just a bit more solid in terms of weight.<br />
While it seemed like they took some time to get used to the presence of each other, by the end of the visit, they played and interacted with each other without needing any encouragement from us. I now know that Bean is capable of independent play (the adults spent a whole meal eating around the dining table while the two played in the play area)! This visit seemed like they were closer than their time spent in California together, even though that was only a few months prior.<br />
I worried that Bean was going to have some withdrawal, but she seems to be coping it quite well; Mommy might be the one that ends up in withdrawal as she settles us back into a quieter routine that will likely be marked with hibernation tendencies due to the cooler weather.<br />
The two weeks seemed to go by quickly, as each day was packed with an activity, with only one or two days of resting at home. I discovered that it&#8217;s more fun and motivating to do things with others &#8211; and that there is a lot of low to no-cost activities offered here in region! Each day required some flexibility, as we often didn&#8217;t leave the house until past 10:30 or 11am, but nap times were generally around 2:30pm &#8211; sometimes&nbsp;in the car.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Our&nbsp;stay-cation</h3>
<p>Niagara area</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cousin&#8217;s wedding at Creekside Estate Winery</strong>:&nbsp;a&nbsp;lovely&nbsp;intimate evening outdoor wedding,&nbsp;with traditions brought&nbsp;in from the bride and groom&#8217;s culture &#8211; Metis and Chinese (including&nbsp;a&nbsp;tying ceremony and mooncakes). However, I couldn&#8217;t bring myself to try the cheese and crackers&nbsp;that&nbsp;many of the fruit flies feasted on &#8211;&nbsp;they can&#8217;t&nbsp;be avoided at this time of the year because of the grapes they say); we managed to catch the super moon / lunar eclipse!</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://outletcollectionatniagara.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Outlet Collection at Niagara</a></strong>&nbsp;&#8211; I found it to be more spacious with better food selection / food courts&nbsp;than Premium Outlets &#8211; though we managed to squeeze in a 30-minute power shopping stop&nbsp;at those outlets too in Milton on the way to the airport</li>
<li><strong>August 8</strong>: The Golden&nbsp;Lotus buffet at Fallsview charges a ridiculous $16 for a 2-year old (same until 10 years old) even though the adults are $20. <em>How many two year olds can eat the same amount as a ten-year old, or 4/5ths of an adult?&nbsp;</em>I enjoyed the variety and quality of the kitchen (cooked) options. They charge a more reasonable $1.20 per year of the child (free under 2). As it turns out mind you, August 8 pricing is&nbsp;actually more per person than Fallsview (because Lotus includes tax and it&#8217;s lower per adult), so&nbsp;had we gone,&nbsp;Golden Lotus would&#8217;ve saved us at least $16 in the end despite the $16 meal for the 2-year old. Ah well, at least we can say we tried August&nbsp;8 now.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<div>In town</div>
<ul>
<li><strong>Early Years Centre:</strong> Music &amp; Movement scheduled program meant that they participated in some songs and parachute fun. It was C&#8217;s first time, but she wasn&#8217;t shy about it the second time we went; they also had the opportunity to play on the Little Tikes plastic playground&nbsp;items in the open gym&nbsp;and little odds and ends in the Orange Room</li>
<li><strong>Pioneer Park Library: </strong>C was around for our first toy-borrowing experience&nbsp;so she got to play with some new toys with Bean. Bean is now super excited when she sees a new toy from the library.</li>
<li><strong>St. Jacob&#8217;s and Anna Mae&#8217;s</strong> (Millbank): We also checked out the newly rebuilt St. Jacob&#8217;s market on a Thursday, and even though it was a weekday, it was bustling with people and it seemed a lot bigger in general: with vendors outside and inside of three separate buildings! At one booth, the woman remembered me from the Etsy show two weeks ago, and I found out that she sells her&nbsp;Calendula balm was actually $2 cheaper at the market &#8211; and it seemed to be an already reasonable price at the show! ($10 tax in at the market). We managed to catch a filling lunch at Anna Mae&#8217;s, a place my parents actually stumbled upon years back, famous for their broasted chicken and pies.</li>
<li><strong>The Museum:&nbsp;</strong>It was pretty much deserted at the Museum, which allowed ample time and space for them to play and explore. The two probably spent the most time in the infant and toddler area and the boat water station (just playing with the water, not exactly directing the boats downstream). Sadly, the top floor is now more geared for adults as opposed to children &#8211; gone is the sticker and balloon rooms and the science and nutrition stations. Bean enjoyed watching her grandfather flap his arms to a dinosaur game and playing in the color-changing sand pit; she also loved the star show (where we blasted off to many planets, including Jupiter, resulting in her new favourite planet and her frequent reminder asking me, &#8220;Do you remember we went to Jupiter?&#8221;) but C was &#8220;all done&#8221; had to leave&nbsp;shortly after it begun (fear of the dark?).</li>
<li><strong>Waterloo Park (Zoo):&nbsp;</strong>Bean was a lot more hesitant about the animals roaming around behind the fences at Waterloo Park, but C seemed to enjoy them, especially the llamas, since she knows a song about them. It seems like many of the animals seems to have disappeared, leaving behind overgrown and/or empty habitats including the bunnies and pigs.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Shantz Family Farm:&nbsp;</strong>This farm is just five minutes down the road from us &#8211; I don&#8217;t know why we haven&#8217;t gone to it before as everything, including the corn maze is free. The two girls loved the plastic play toys (Little Tikes houses and slides) &nbsp;in the children&#8217;s straw maze area and Bean had a great time with accessible banana seat swings (as opposed to the diaper seats). When we visited on a weekday, it looked abandoned but this past Thanksgiving Monday, it was bustling with families &#8211; what a contrast! Bean was afraid of the animals during her first visit, but seemed to warm up to them to the point of wanting to watch and &#8220;feed&#8221; them on Thanksgiving Monday.</li>
<li><strong>Kitchener Market&nbsp;</strong>for Saturday produce and bacon shopping, iced pineapple tea and breadbaron, with a side visit to the Asian supermarket down the street. The children&#8217;s program was a bit too advanced for the two kids but they tried to glue a fall wreath together anyway.</li>
<li><strong>Oktoberfest:&nbsp;</strong>Because their visit coincided with the beginning of Oktoberfest, we took a trip downtown to check out the street vendors and happened to wander into Hockeytown instead. I thought it was a bit strange that Oktoberfest was so hockey-fied and thought maybe they were sponsors until I later learned that they were two different events in the same area. I think we enjoyed hockeytown more as they had more kid-friendly activities and freebies (including a free jersey for children under 16!).</li>
<li><strong>Stratford &#8211; The Sound of Music:&nbsp;</strong>The grandparents and j.w lovingly stayed at home to babysit while the sisters had a date to see the Sound of Music in Stratford (40 min leisurely drive &#8211; it seems like a lot shorter drive than 40 minutes on the&nbsp;401 towards Toronto for some reason), thanks to a Groupon-advertised $40 deal. We sat a row apart, next to the sound booth, but the view was great and the sound booth wasn&#8217;t much of a distraction &#8211; other than me noticing that the guy had the script and music score of the entire play in a binder and would be following along (though at times, he had to catch up a few pages); I do wonder if the AV guy has memorized most of it by now or is bored from seeing it over and over. My short review as posted on Facebook:<br />
<blockquote><p>Wasn&#8217;t sure it was worth seeing the Sound of Music twice, but it was different enough and surprisingly, I enjoyed Stratford&#8217;s version more than Toronto&#8217;s &#8211; the key characters were believable, and I welcomed the comic relief (Max and the &#8220;cowboys&#8221; as referenced in the review &#8211; one vignette coincided well with Oktoberfest). If you have time before the season ends, go catch it!</p>

<p>When dining out, we celebrated my sister&#8217;s birthday at Dels and treated my mom to the westernized version of pig ears (fried and savoury sweet) at Fork and Cork Grill. We also managed two lunch visits to Mikey&#8217;s and shared some deep-fried tofu (they previously liked) and introduced them to their version of iced lemon tea, beef brisket noodle soup and condensed milk HK style french toast! j.w also took everyone to SOS BBQ for his favourite in town fish and chips, Downtown Crepe Cafe for cappuccino and crepes, Seven Shores for cappuccino and café mocha (my fave place for the latter), and to breadbaron for our family favourite sandwich place (ms piggy! though porksgiving is another fav of mine too when they don&#8217;t offer ms piggy). In Mississauga, we tried to visit the recommended Grand Chinese Cuisine, but it was closed to a private wedding reception (though my mother thinks that was a good thing as we found out later that a noodle dish is regularly $18!) so we ended up at Royal Jasmine (very salty but that&#8217;s all I know near the 401) and Phoenix (not to be confused with the chain in GTA), a HK style café which had great baked pork chop on fried rice and other good ha-ng-cha dishes overall!<br />
If you&#8217;re a friend on Facebook, we&#8217;ve posted a <del>few</del> number of photos of them together.</p>
<h3>Developmental progress</h3>
<div>Bean has picked up a few sayings and mannerisms from her cousin (and vice versa) and now sings a version of Veggie Tales&#8217; &#8220;where is my hairbrush&#8221; and Sesame Street&#8217;s &#8220;brush your teeth&#8221; song and says &#8220;nope&#8221; and &#8220;yep&#8221; in addition to her usual &#8220;no&#8221; and &#8220;yeah&#8221;;&nbsp;the strangest one yet seems to be her regression in being toilet&nbsp;trained&nbsp;for&nbsp;#2. She used to tell us when she needed to go but&nbsp;a few days into their visit, she actually went in her diaper (and didn&#8217;t tell me and even when I asked, she didn&#8217;t seem bothered), and even now, she ends up with a funny look (with her poking or picking her nose?!) while on occasion with some crying. When she does acknowledge that she needs to go, and I ask her about it, she tells me she needs to pee too (which she does&#8230;which I guess&nbsp;that&#8217;s progress to a degree!)</div>

 Their way of saying goodbye!

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				I had a chance to spend a night away a few weekends ago sans child (<em>and</em> husband) for the first time and while I had moments where another friend&#8217;s almost 2-year old daughter reminded me of Bean, the experience felt strangely quite liberating, especially at the wedding reception in the evening as I didn&#8217;t have to keep watching the clock, my phone for child-related messages (in fact, I had forgotten it at home!), or for a good opportunity to leave early because it was her bedtime; it was also nice to be able to spend the afternoon with a few friends associated with my time in Ottawa without worrying that j.w would be bored, some of which I hadn&#8217;t seen or talked to in many years, many of whom are now married and have children of their own, and all but one have settled elsewhere.<br />
When my friend, the father of the almost 2-yo asked me what Bean was like, I had a moment&#8217;s pause: what do I say? I&#8217;m not sure whether her antics are typical of toddlers, or unique to Bean&#8217;s personality, like her preference to mommy first or her nature to do things a specific way or expectations of them to be done in a certain order and will often get frustrated when she wants to do it herself but doesn&#8217;t know how yet. I would probably have a better answer to that question if I poll people who interact with her (@readers: feel free to comment on this!). Now after some reflection, I could say that she seems to observe first, followed by narrating everything she sees or asking what other people are doing, but while she prefers the company of others, especially during play, when she&#8217;s around a group of people or new faces, she doesn&#8217;t tend to say as much; she is more of a follower than a leader &#8211; initially cautious or unsure, watching what others do before she tries it and oft seeks approval by looking my way to gauge my reaction &#8211; but that is also perhaps why she enjoys the company of older boys too (they seem to have an air of confidence) and tends to pick up certain things very quickly; and when testing boundaries, she sometimes also has this calculating look before she decides whether to do what you just told her not to do.&nbsp; (Lately though, we&#8217;ve noticed her starting to stutter at the beginning of some sentences even though her ideas are quite formed, but my mother says my brother did that and grew out of it too so it&#8217;s not necessarily a cause to worry yet)		</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				BTSC, BASC, BPSC, BESC, BRD, BBID, BES, BIS, BDS&#8230;this is just a shortlist of the myriad of acronyms that I encountered at my last job — of course not all of them started with the letter B. I must not have been the only one to get lost in the sea of acronyms because someone put together an acronym dictionary online at one point for people to consult (how many people knew about it is another question).<br />
Guess what? When you enter the realm of mommy-hood, you don&#8217;t escape the realm of acronyms either, especially if you spend anytime online. I remember wondering what certain acronyms meant, and while I could venture a guess at some, others I had to look up as well (trusty Google ← an ironic statement right there). And while some are directly related to your status as a mother, like SAHM, WAHM, DH, DD, DS, LO, EBF, you also encounter ones that are related to buying and selling items such as baby clothing and gear like EUC, NWT, PP, PM. Oh, I just learned about HIPPO and GOAT as I was typing this post, at first puzzled to why animals would represent read or not read the previous posts but then I read what they stood for.<br />
But like my previous job, once I figured them out, I started to use acronym-speak but I still tend to spell it out depending on who I think my audience is. Now, if you don&#8217;t know the &#8220;mommy-acronyms&#8221;, take a guess at some and then check the answers below.</p>
<ul style="font-size: small;">
<li>SAHM: stay-at-home mom, WAHM: work-at-home mom</li>
<li>DH: dear husband, DD: dear daughter, DS: dear son, LO: little one</li>
<li>EBF: exclusively breast-fe(e)d</li>
<li>EUC: excellent used condition, NWT: new with tags, PP: pending pick-up, PM: private message</li>
<li>HIPPO: happily ignoring previous posters, GOAT: going over asinine threads</li>
</ul>
<p>How many did you get right?		</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4>@15 months</h4>
<ul>
<li><em>Dohk</em> or &#8216;Poke&#8217; when she pokes at things, like the top of the faucet</li>
<li>starting to sign &#8216;apple&#8217; but she just taps the side of her head (looks exactly like the sign for phone)</li>
<li>Says <em>woah woah</em> when a dog barks</li>
<li>Makes a <em>bak /</em><em>pak</em> sound when trying to put a button together or when a button snaps together</li>
<li>Calls out and looks for <em>por por</em>, her maternal grandmother &#8211; she only seems to ever call out to her, nobody else&#8230;uses it more than <em>mama</em> (only calls mama when she is desperate or sad)</li>
<li>Covers her mouth with her hand(s) and says &#8220;oh!&#8221; when she drops something or to say uh-oh &lt;- I did this once and she quickly copied me and now does it on her own</li>
<li>her grand-aunt taught her how to say &#8216;no!&#8217; (sigh) so she now says it emphatically when something is disagreeable to her</li>
<li>Mimics <em>mo </em>(none, nothing)</li>
<li>While her confidence in B sounding words is continually better, she&#8217;s starting to practice D sounding words like <em>deng</em> (throw) too</li>
<li>Can start three songs: &#8220;<em>doh&#8221; (</em>re mi fa so&#8230;), &#8220;row row&#8221; (row your boat), <em>&#8220;baa baa&#8221; </em>(black sheep)</li>
</ul>
<p>Apart from learning to communicate in a way that we understand,&nbsp; she mimics facial expressions and learns to copy whatever you&#8217;re doing very quickly (so I have to be careful of what I do, such as not opening a cupboard door in front of her that I don&#8217;t want her to open) like winking at my dad (closes one eye and scrunches up her face) because that&#8217;s what he does to get her attention. She also likes to sway to music or bob her head with the beat (maybe she&#8217;ll be musical, something mommy lacks!), and loves to drink soup (so when she slows down, we make her food into soup, shh!)<br />
This month, a two important milestones happened: one bottom right molar is starting to poke through <em>and </em>she took her first steps unassisted! (to lunge for the phone haha&#8230;she also walked a lot further unassisted when she was holding a remote in her hand &#8211; she must have momentarily forgot that she wasn&#8217;t holding an adult&#8217;s hand). Sometimes, when she stumbles, I think it is because she&#8217;s not super confident yet, which reminds me of <a title="Walking on Water" href="http://her.happyhippos.ca/2005/02/walking-on-water/">when Peter walks on water</a>.		</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				Lately, we&#8217;ve noticed that Little Bean has started to express herself more vocally, sometimes in a way that we adults seem to understand. I guess after being immersed in one or two languages for a little over a year, she can start to communicate, even though she has already understood us much sooner and much more than what her parents make of her babbling (though, parents tend to figure out their babies types of cries early on, such as I&#8217;m hungry, I&#8217;m sleepy, don&#8217;t-abandon-me).<br />
When people ask what her first word was, I always think &#8211; do they mean her first syllable that sounds like a word that we know, or a word that she actually means? She often seems to say words that we recognize as words, sometimes identifying them correctly, but other times they seem nonsensical. I do wonder if Chinese babies have an easier time learning to speak their first words because baby words tend to be in syllables of two (of the same words), and if they miss the inflection, the parents often have other contextual cues to figure out what they mean.</p>
<h4><strong>@12 months</strong></h4>
<p>In addition to the &#8220;oooh&#8221; and the &#8220;woooah&#8221;s she&#8217;s had early on, her &#8220;vocabulary&#8221; seems to encompass the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lifts both hands to show she wants you to pick her up</li>
<li><em>Ma-ma</em>: meaning mama, mommy&#8230;though I wonder if she distinguishes the inflections or gets confused sometimes about why a horsey doesn&#8217;t look like her mother</li>
<li><em>Mum-mum</em>: food</li>
<li><em>Nai-nai</em> (and the ASL sign for it &#8211; like milking a cow, yes):&nbsp; milk</li>
<li><em>Bye-bye</em>, often accompanied with an up and down wave with some wrist-movement</li>
<li>Finishing a gulp of water or milk with <em>ahhh</em>, a sign of tastiness</li>
<li>A side-to-side wave to signal hi</li>
<li>Waves two hands to signal all-done (with her meal usually)</li>
<li>Vigorously shakes her head sideways: no, she doesn&#8217;t want whatever you&#8217;re trying to give her</li>
<li>Points or lifts her hands up to direct your attention to whatever she&#8217;s pointing out</li>
<li>And lately, almost everything is <em>woah-woah</em> but her inflections change slightly when she refers to an actual <em>woh-woh, </em>a doggie</li>
<li>Knowing that she can blow bubbles and smack her lips, I tried to show her how to blow a kiss with her own hand, and surprisingly, she was also quick to pick up on it!</li>
</ul>
<p>I&#8217;m sure the list will expand even more quite soon &#8211; maybe I&#8217;ll keep it updated as we start to figure out more of her baby language.		</p>
