								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				Today marks the end of steamed milk in my coffee, grilled cheese sandwiches, peanut butter pretzels and buttered popcorn, yogurt, ice cream, and other products containing milk, possibly soy, and peanuts in my diet until the end of our breastfeeding days, which&nbsp;might be for another year or more. While I only have to endure it until the end of our breastfeeding time together, our little one might have to watch his diet for the rest of his life &#8211; I&#8217;m sad for him, but at least he won&#8217;t have memories of enjoying those, so he may have less cravings for them, and hopefully better self-control (than I do!)[ref]I didn&#8217;t realize how much I regularly enjoy milk products until now, even though I don&#8217;t care for milk itself[/ref].&nbsp;<br />
I once suspected that milk might have been the culprit in his&nbsp;bouts of eczema and bloody stools[ref]though the latter might still be as a result of constipation[/ref], when he was known to spit up after every feeding (I would say mild reflux), and experienced three vomiting episodes after eating one serving of rice cereal that contained milk ingredients, but I was in denial; how could it be? My daily diet only consisted of milk in my one cup of espresso &#8211; or so I thought; I forgot about the cheese, ice cream, butter, everything else that has milk protein in it. I&#8217;m pretty sure I was in denial, so I didn&#8217;t&nbsp;cut anything in my diet, thinking that it wasn&#8217;t really an allergy, and like his sister, would outgrow it. Now, after a visit to an allergist and a positive prick/rash/allergy test, it&#8217;s official: he&nbsp;has a milk and peanut&nbsp;allergy.<br />
So now, our low-maintenance baby has become a high-maintenance one; I guess our &#8220;easy&#8221; baby was too good to be true. Yet, this news comes at a timely moment in our lives; we&#8217;re reading through&nbsp;<em>The Power of a Praying Parent</em> by Stormie Omartian (I keep thinking it&#8217;s &#8220;O&#8217;Martian&#8221;), and we just covered a chapter that talks about releasing our children to God, and this is an example of a very much an appropriate moment to follow her model of prayer: that if it&#8217;s in His will and in His time, that our son will outgrow both his allergies; but&nbsp;if not, will be managed well so that no one would ever need to use an epipen on him; but if so, that it is administered successfully and effectively.<br />
I&#8217;m still processing the news, so I didn&#8217;t get a chance to think of and ask the many follow-up questions that have since popped up (stemming from online research and what others have shared with me &#8211; yep, I&#8217;m also one of those internet moms), but here are some questions that people have asked and the answers I have come across:<br />
<strong>Q. Will he outgrow his&nbsp;allergy?<br />
A.&nbsp;</strong><a href="http://aacijournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1710-1492-7-S1-S7#Sec12" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Possibly</a>. Our allergist says that many children outgrow their milk allergy by the age of 5. I just found out&nbsp;that my siblings and I all had milk allergies until we were 1 years old, and our mother experimented by trying to reintroduce milk slowly and over time. However, only 20% of kids outgrow their peanut allergy. Because Bean seemed to have a milder reaction to peanut butter when she was younger, but outgrew it by 2 years old &#8211; which surprised him, the allergist suggested paying for a blood test to see if her brother&nbsp;would qualify for reintroduction of peanuts under clinical supervision; we&#8217;re praying that&nbsp;he&#8217;d be eligible. So, as of now, it is what it is &#8211; will just have to adapt to manage it.<br />
<strong>Q. How severe is his allergy?<br />
A.</strong> At the skin prick test, the one for peanuts was about 5mm, and the one for milk was slightly larger (6mm, maybe?); I think&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15482519" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the size indicates a positive diagnosi</a>s,&nbsp;but I didn&#8217;t think to ask. According to one site,&nbsp;&#8220;<a href="http://www.kidswithfoodallergies.org/page/food-allergy-test-diagnosis-skin-prick-blood.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">no test [&#8230;] can determine severity</a>&#8220;. Nevertheless,&nbsp;we&#8217;ve been advised to keep two epipens with him. While, I don&#8217;t know the criteria for what makes an allergy a risk for anaphylaxis, we have&nbsp;seen <a href="http://aacijournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1710-1492-7-S1-S6#Sec4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">symptoms matching the criteria in Table 3, section 2 (GI and skin symptoms)</a>&nbsp;and <a href="http://aacijournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1710-1492-7-S1-S6#Sec3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">in this table</a>.<br />
The allergist&nbsp;prescribed two injectors (<a href="http://www.kidswithfoodallergies.org/page/newly-diagnosed.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">as does this site</a>), but I think&nbsp;most people I know only carry one. Although he does not meet <a href="http://aacijournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1710-1492-10-40" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the minimum recommended weight of 15 KG (33 LBs)</a>, the allergist still recommended that over a self-administered antidote citing that human / user error is very common. He then used an ultrasound machine to measure the thickness of muscle between the skin and the bone, to make sure that our son&#8217;s thighs is fat enough &#8211; more than 13mm &#8211; <a href="http://aacijournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1710-1492-10-40#Sec2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">so that the injection won&#8217;t hit bone</a> (and bone marrow, which is equivalent to a IV administration and that&#8217;s bad); he was 16mm. Another option is available (TwinJet?) but is supposedly the same dose.<br />
<strong>Q. Is there no other option other than Epipen? What about Benadryl?</strong><br />
<strong>A. </strong>The allergist and online sources tells me that&nbsp;Benadryl won&#8217;t help with breathing, but it may help reduce other symptoms (e.g. puffy eyes, lips).<br />
<strong>Q. What can he drink instead of milk, to get the fat content and other nutrients that is in whole milk?<br />
A.&nbsp;</strong>My dietician and online sources say that breastmilk is best so to keep breastfeeding for as long as possible. As long as we have the go ahead to eat soy, we can also have soy and coconut milk; there&#8217;s rice and almond milk as well. I&#8217;ve tried hemp milk, and it tastes like grassy straw, which I&#8217;m not a fan of at all. Fortified alternatives provide at least 30% calcium and some fat content, but it doesn&#8217;t completely replace milk&#8217;s benefits; it&#8217;s also a shame that many companies use carrageenan (or xanthan gum, but not as bad) to thicken their drink, and add sea salt to flavour it. I have to remember to continue to supplement him with Vitamin D. For good fat, I will likely have to be more creative, using oils like avocado or olive, and serving more salmon (frozen filet steaks of wild Alaskan salmon is readily available from Kirkland / Costco year-round, works out to be 10$/lb which is reasonable)<br />
<strong>Q. What about formula?<br />
A.&nbsp;</strong>Online sources seem to suggest that if a baby has a milk allergy, baby may have a higher likelihood of developing a soy allergy, so switching to a soy based formula may end up increasing the risk.<br />
<strong>Q. Can he have lactose-free, cheese, or yogurt? What about goat&#8217;s or sheep&#8217;s milk?<br />
A.&nbsp;</strong>Unfortunately, the allergy is to the milk protein, not the lactose. Most people with milk allergy is to cow&#8217;s milk protein, but I&#8217;m not sure if we have the go-ahead to try other kinds of dairy.<br />
I did mention that I had accidentally fed him vegetables cooked in butter a couple of times and failed to see a reaction, to which he was surprised, so as a result, he told me keep to doing it, but don&#8217;t go beyond what I normally would have done. We will likely have to monitor him very, very closely if we do that &#8211; not to mention, we&#8217;ll have to watch&nbsp;him even more closely when we aren&#8217;t the ones providing his meal / food. Though, I wonder if he&nbsp;can tolerate <a href="https://aacijournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1710-1492-8-5#Sec1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">extreme heated milk products</a>&nbsp;&#8211; will have to ask.<br />
<strong>Q. Can he have other nuts?</strong><br />
A. In theory, yes. Peanuts is technically a legume and not a tree nut (e.g walnut, pecan), but we have to be careful of cross contamination because they may be processed in facility that isn&#8217;t peanut free.<br />
<strong>Q. What about peanut oil?</strong><br />
<strong>A.</strong> I&#8217;m not sure about this one. Online sources say that pure unrefined peanut oil should be safe, but I need to check with the allergist about this one. Will likely have to avoid though,&nbsp;especially in commercial places, like restaurants &#8211; because can you be sure that it&#8217;s pure and unrefined?<br />
<strong>Q. So, are you a peanut and dairy-free household now?</strong><br />
<strong>A.</strong> Thankfully, complete elimination measures aren&#8217;t necessary at this time. In fact, the allergist told us specifically not to stop giving our daughter peanut butter! However,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.hamiltonhealthsciences.ca/documents/Patient%20Education/CowMilkProteinAllergyWhatToEatBreastfeeding-trh.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mom will also need to follow a similar elimination diet</a>, which will be a challenge, as she can&#8217;t eat anything from the allium family either (e.g garlic, onions, chives, leeks).<br />
<strong>Q.</strong> <strong>What can I do to help?</strong><br />
<strong>A.</strong> Pray for us &#8211; I (we) have no idea what I&#8217;m (we&#8217;re) doing. Trying to avoid garlic, onions, etc. is already hard; I&#8217;m also thinking that avoiding dairy will likely be more challenging than peanuts. And, if you eat with us, we especially appreciate that you take our dietary needs into consideration &#8211; understandably, it&#8217;s probably&nbsp;especially hard if you&nbsp;don&#8217;t need to conscientious of it in your everyday life; I&#8217;m sorry for the inconvenience. If you&#8217;re in a similar family situation, I&#8217;m open to hearing advice and your experiences too. Thank you!		</p>

				<description><![CDATA[My first experience seeing a Chinese (herbal) doctor didn&#8217;t fit my mental image of the &#8220;doctor&#8221; being an middle-aged or older Chinese man who wants your money, perhaps in a white wife-beater and/or a lab coat on top with black, round-rimmed, acetate glasses, who sells herbs at an herbal shop in a Chinese mall or Chinatown and does double duty by acting as a &#8220;doctor&#8221;, one who brings you to the back of the room, looks at your problem and weighs out some dried herbs for you to make and drink at home.

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				My first experience seeing a Chinese (herbal) doctor didn&#8217;t fit my mental image of the &#8220;doctor&#8221; being an middle-aged or older Chinese man who wants your money, perhaps in a white wife-beater and/or a lab coat on top with black, round-rimmed, acetate glasses, who sells herbs at an herbal shop in a Chinese mall or Chinatown and does double duty by acting as a &#8220;doctor&#8221;, one who brings you to the back of the room, looks at your problem and weighs out some dried herbs for you to make and drink at home. I don&#8217;t even know where that image comes from, but this Chinese female doctor looked younger than expected, and she had an independent practice, specializing in acupuncture it seems, with consulting rooms and a receptionist inside (irony is that their were drapes that looked like shower curtains that covered the windows to convey a sense of privacy, but if you looked up, a surveillance camera points at you).<br />
The packets say Chinese Herbal Tea, but we were instructed to bathe the baby in it for 20 minutes every other day, one set a day. Let me tell you that bathing a baby for 20 minutes isn&#8217;t easy, especially if said baby can&#8217;t sit up on its own and you&#8217;re trying not to dilute the concentration by adding more warm water to keep the temperature. We were provided with that and a small container of non-identifiable, no label topical cream to be applied 2-3 times a day; this cream along with the expected herbal scent, has a pink tinge to it and it almost smells like roses (rosehip, rose water, rose geranium?)[ref]further Google research suggests that peony might be effective in the fight against eczema and it does have a light rose scent[/ref]. At least the container is a dark brown one, which means its meant to keep light out so the active ingredients don&#8217;t break down as quickly. I am skeptical of mystery &#8220;magical&#8221; products like these and especially since they&#8217;re from China (who knows what it could be tainted with &#8211; lead? mercury?), but I appreciated that each packet of &#8220;spice&#8221; contained the name and amount, most foreign to me except one or two I recognized:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.americandragon.com/Individualherbsupdate/DiYu.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Radix Sanguisorbae</a> (1.2g extracted from 10g): targets liver, large intestine; cooling properties (I&#8217;m guessing that may also extend to anti-itch and reducing inflamed areas)</li>
<li>Herba Portulacae (1.8g extracted from 15g): targets liver, large intestine</li>
<li>Fructus Kochiae (0.9g extracted from 10g): targets kidney, bladder; alleviates itching</li>
<li>Radix Sophorae Flavescentis (0.6g extracted from 6g): targets liver, intestine; alleviates itching</li>
<li><a href="https://tcmwiki.com/wiki/radix-et-rhizoma-rhei" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Radix Et Rhizoma Rhei</a> (0.6g extracted from 3g): targets large intestine; also known as rhubarb!</li>
<li><a href="http://tcmwiki.com/wiki/pericarpium-zanthoxyli" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pericarpium Zanthoxyli</a> (0.6g extracted from 6g): targets stomach; relieves itching (perhaps because of the numbing properties? the Chinese name &#8220;hua jiao&#8221; reminded me of this tongue numbing prickly heat sauce that my parents have in their cupboards, which I often associate with sichuan peppers)</li>
<li><a href="http://tcmwiki.com/wiki/folium-isatidis" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Folium Isatidis</a> (0.9g of 10g): targets liver and stomach</li>
</ul>
<p>So the common theme seems to be a heat-expelling formula that targets the digestive system, which seems to be in-line with western natural wellness thinking &#8211; that eczema is a symptom of what&#8217;s going on in your gut / digestive system / with your digestion, often a sign of food sensitivities or allergies. This also seems to match what another Chinese herbal remedies site suggests about common formulas[ref]. Wonder if this kind of &#8220;heat&#8221; is the same as &#8220;hot air&#8221;-associated foods like chocolate (she did say not to have any), chips, crustaceans, deep-fried oily food. And would eating &#8220;cooling&#8221; foods like watermelon, cucumber, bittermelon help with baby&#8217;s skin then?<br />
<strong>&#8220;Formulas that clear heat</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Clear heat and reduce fire</li>
<li>Clear heat and eliminate toxins</li>
<li>Clear heat and purge lung fire</li>
<li>Cleanse liver and resolves toxicity</li>
<li>Clear dampness-heat in liver and bladder</li>
<li>Clear dampness-heat in intestines and stomach&#8221;</li>
</ul>
<p>Source: <a href="http://www.chineseherbshealing.com/chinese-herbal-formulas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://www.chineseherbshealing.com/chinese-herbal-formulas</a>[/ref]<br />
I think I would still prefer naturopathic doctors (ND) over Chinese doctors (CMD) because it seems NDs take more time to explain (treatment, etc.) and look at the lifestyle as a whole, even though I know that Chinese medicine is probably even more holistic (and mystical to me) if you look at the body&#8217;s qi, etc.; it is also nice that extended health insurance covers the services of a ND (probably because they are registered and governed by a body), but not of a CMD. Would I have seen a Chinese doctor for my baby&#8217;s eczema without nudging from my mother-in-law? Probably not. Especially not because of the cost and because we are already seeing a dermatologist (and thus East meets or conflicts with West?) and because our first outgrew most of hers. Admittedly, with only one treatment so far, it seems to be more effective in speedy results compared with the continued steroid / cortisone use (which I don&#8217;t want to rely on anyway); I just don&#8217;t know if there are going to be side effects or if the problem will come back and I wasn&#8217;t told what the products would do so it feels like she expects me to trust her in blind faith. I know baby skin and bodies are just so much more sensitive than our adult ones, and because it absorbs everything like a sponge and their little systems are still growing, I still have reservations on whether we made the right choice &#8211; maybe it&#8217;s an answered prayer since it coincided around the same time. So maybe the $220+ will be worthwhile ($100 for consultation fee, $50 for the packets and $70 cream&#8230;<em>yipes</em>), but maybe not. I guess like all areas where I have little knowledge in, this is where some faith comes into play; I may have faith in God, but I trust him so it comes easier than faith in mankind.		</p>
