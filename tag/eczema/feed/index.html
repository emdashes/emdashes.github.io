								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				My first experience seeing a Chinese (herbal) doctor didn&#8217;t fit my mental image of the &#8220;doctor&#8221; being an middle-aged or older Chinese man who wants your money, perhaps in a white wife-beater and/or a lab coat on top with black, round-rimmed, acetate glasses, who sells herbs at an herbal shop in a Chinese mall or Chinatown and does double duty by acting as a &#8220;doctor&#8221;, one who brings you to the back of the room, looks at your problem and weighs out some dried herbs for you to make and drink at home. I don&#8217;t even know where that image comes from, but this Chinese female doctor looked younger than expected, and she had an independent practice, specializing in acupuncture it seems, with consulting rooms and a receptionist inside (irony is that their were drapes that looked like shower curtains that covered the windows to convey a sense of privacy, but if you looked up, a surveillance camera points at you).<br />
The packets say Chinese Herbal Tea, but we were instructed to bathe the baby in it for 20 minutes every other day, one set a day. Let me tell you that bathing a baby for 20 minutes isn&#8217;t easy, especially if said baby can&#8217;t sit up on its own and you&#8217;re trying not to dilute the concentration by adding more warm water to keep the temperature. We were provided with that and a small container of non-identifiable, no label topical cream to be applied 2-3 times a day; this cream along with the expected herbal scent, has a pink tinge to it and it almost smells like roses (rosehip, rose water, rose geranium?)[ref]further Google research suggests that peony might be effective in the fight against eczema and it does have a light rose scent[/ref]. At least the container is a dark brown one, which means its meant to keep light out so the active ingredients don&#8217;t break down as quickly. I am skeptical of mystery &#8220;magical&#8221; products like these and especially since they&#8217;re from China (who knows what it could be tainted with &#8211; lead? mercury?), but I appreciated that each packet of &#8220;spice&#8221; contained the name and amount, most foreign to me except one or two I recognized:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.americandragon.com/Individualherbsupdate/DiYu.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Radix Sanguisorbae</a> (1.2g extracted from 10g): targets liver, large intestine; cooling properties (I&#8217;m guessing that may also extend to anti-itch and reducing inflamed areas)</li>
<li>Herba Portulacae (1.8g extracted from 15g): targets liver, large intestine</li>
<li>Fructus Kochiae (0.9g extracted from 10g): targets kidney, bladder; alleviates itching</li>
<li>Radix Sophorae Flavescentis (0.6g extracted from 6g): targets liver, intestine; alleviates itching</li>
<li><a href="https://tcmwiki.com/wiki/radix-et-rhizoma-rhei" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Radix Et Rhizoma Rhei</a> (0.6g extracted from 3g): targets large intestine; also known as rhubarb!</li>
<li><a href="http://tcmwiki.com/wiki/pericarpium-zanthoxyli" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pericarpium Zanthoxyli</a> (0.6g extracted from 6g): targets stomach; relieves itching (perhaps because of the numbing properties? the Chinese name &#8220;hua jiao&#8221; reminded me of this tongue numbing prickly heat sauce that my parents have in their cupboards, which I often associate with sichuan peppers)</li>
<li><a href="http://tcmwiki.com/wiki/folium-isatidis" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Folium Isatidis</a> (0.9g of 10g): targets liver and stomach</li>
</ul>
<p>So the common theme seems to be a heat-expelling formula that targets the digestive system, which seems to be in-line with western natural wellness thinking &#8211; that eczema is a symptom of what&#8217;s going on in your gut / digestive system / with your digestion, often a sign of food sensitivities or allergies. This also seems to match what another Chinese herbal remedies site suggests about common formulas[ref]. Wonder if this kind of &#8220;heat&#8221; is the same as &#8220;hot air&#8221;-associated foods like chocolate (she did say not to have any), chips, crustaceans, deep-fried oily food. And would eating &#8220;cooling&#8221; foods like watermelon, cucumber, bittermelon help with baby&#8217;s skin then?<br />
<strong>&#8220;Formulas that clear heat</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Clear heat and reduce fire</li>
<li>Clear heat and eliminate toxins</li>
<li>Clear heat and purge lung fire</li>
<li>Cleanse liver and resolves toxicity</li>
<li>Clear dampness-heat in liver and bladder</li>
<li>Clear dampness-heat in intestines and stomach&#8221;</li>
</ul>

I think I would still prefer naturopathic doctors (ND) over Chinese doctors (CMD) because it seems NDs take more time to explain (treatment, etc.) and look at the lifestyle as a whole, even though I know that Chinese medicine is probably even more holistic (and mystical to me) if you look at the body&#8217;s qi, etc.; it is also nice that extended health insurance covers the services of a ND (probably because they are registered and governed by a body), but not of a CMD. Would I have seen a Chinese doctor for my baby&#8217;s eczema without nudging from my mother-in-law? Probably not. Especially not because of the cost and because we are already seeing a dermatologist (and thus East meets or conflicts with West?) and because our first outgrew most of hers. Admittedly, with only one treatment so far, it seems to be more effective in speedy results compared with the continued steroid / cortisone use (which I don&#8217;t want to rely on anyway); I just don&#8217;t know if there are going to be side effects or if the problem will come back and I wasn&#8217;t told what the products would do so it feels like she expects me to trust her in blind faith. I know baby skin and bodies are just so much more sensitive than our adult ones, and because it absorbs everything like a sponge and their little systems are still growing, I still have reservations on whether we made the right choice &#8211; maybe it&#8217;s an answered prayer since it coincided around the same time. So maybe the $220+ will be worthwhile ($100 for consultation fee, $50 for the packets and $70 cream&#8230;<em>yipes</em>), but maybe not. I guess like all areas where I have little knowledge in, this is where some faith comes into play; I may have faith in God, but I trust him so it comes easier than faith in mankind.		</p>
