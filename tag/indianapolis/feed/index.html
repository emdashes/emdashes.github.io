								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				For our first vacation without kids, we went to Indianapolis. <em>for. a. gaming. convention</em>. Yup. I tell people that I had thought we were doing Chicago paired with this (as it&#8217;s on my roadtrip list), but it turned out to be only this. And, in hindsight, probably wise that it was only this, as this was a spending vacation, and by the end of it, we ended taking home some new games, some promo packs, enamel pins, and a few litres of local beer.<br />
Gaming seems to have become more popular over the last few years. Case in point: I spent more time at the convention <a href="http://her.happyhippos.ca/2010/08/indianapolis/">than the first time,</a> the US border guard actually plays Magic: The Gathering (he asked what j.w thought about Core 19), and our server at Payne&#8217;s in Gas City plays Pokémon GO.<br />
<figure id="attachment_6621" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-6621" style="width: 763px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="wp-image-6621 size-full" src="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/steps.png" alt="" width="763" height="383" srcset="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/steps.png 763w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/steps-300x151.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 763px) 100vw, 763px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-6621" class="wp-caption-text">Recorded steps during Gen Con</figcaption></figure><br />
This year, because we were at an airbnb that was almost a 40-minute walk away, we decided we needed to get there between 7-8am to get a spot at the Circle Center Mall garage, which was a few dollars less than neighbouring parking garages. This meant that I woke up too early every day and walked over 20K steps the first two days (when my average is usually between 7-10k) so by the time day 3 hit, I was quite exhausted by 10pm in addition to being tired in the mornings. This also meant that while learning to play Roll for the Galaxy: Ambition (the expansion), I accidentally &#8220;rolled&#8221; my cup of coffee instead of my cup of dice. Gaaah.</p>
<h3 id="firstHeading" class="firstHeading" lang="en">Pre-Gen Con</h3>
<p>I got the most steps on Wednesday, likely from walking through the 100 Acres: The Virginia B. Fairbanks Art and Nature Park, Newfields, walking back to our car from kayaking along the canal, checking out the Stink (a pre-con meetup) to get some freebies and waiting in line for our badges.<br />

<figure id="attachment_6620" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-6620" style="width: 169px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="size-medium wp-image-6620" src="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_20180801_113732-169x300.jpg" alt="" width="169" height="300" srcset="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_20180801_113732-169x300.jpg 169w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_20180801_113732-768x1366.jpg 768w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_20180801_113732-576x1024.jpg 576w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_20180801_113732-1568x2789.jpg 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 169px) 100vw, 169px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-6620" class="wp-caption-text">Park of Laments: a long rocky corridor to reach an enclosed dead end. Photo credits: j.woo</figcaption></figure><br />
I really enjoyed the walk in the park and interacting with the art installations mixed in with nature, like hovering rings and sloped yellow benches, but it was too bad that a few installations seem to have disappeared and the path around the lake was closed due to erosion. There was this one place called &#8220;<em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Park_of_Laments" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Park of Laments</a>&#8221; </em>and it was truly a fitting title as you had to enter a narrow tunnel surrounded by two walls of rocks to get to an enclosed park area where it was essentially a dead end. A less depressing piece titled, <em>&#8220;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Funky_Bones" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Funky Bones</a>&#8221; </em> actually had me humming, &#8220;these dry bones, these dry bones&#8230;&#8221;  (from what lyrics / songs I don&#8217;t know, but they&#8217;re a reference to Ezekiel 37:1-14).<br />
I&#8217;m glad that we finally got to visit the park since it was on a my to-do list from last time, along with visiting the canal. Last time, I saw the surreys for rental on my way to the zoo, but I&#8217;m glad my friend (another j.w!) was willing to do tandem kayaking with me instead! I was a tad nervous as it was my first time in a kayak / canoe without a life jacket but when I asked about life jackets, the rental place said it was only 3 ft deep and comes up to the chest &#8211; and yes we were fine.<br />

<h3>Food and Drinks</h3>
<p>The food truck food around the convention centre was mediocre at best this year, but here were some unexpected finds:<br />
<figure id="attachment_6627" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-6627" style="width: 194px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="wp-image-6627 size-medium" src="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/DSC_1606-e1533879040733-194x300.jpg" alt="" width="194" height="300" srcset="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/DSC_1606-e1533879040733-194x300.jpg 194w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/DSC_1606-e1533879040733-768x1185.jpg 768w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/DSC_1606-e1533879040733-664x1024.jpg 664w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/DSC_1606-e1533879040733-1568x2419.jpg 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 194px) 100vw, 194px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-6627" class="wp-caption-text">Landos: a double shot of espresso with a vegan peach and rose whipped cream topped with golden sprinkles. Perfect dessert with a caffeine kick to continue gaming through the evening</figcaption></figure></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/paynesrestaurant/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Payne&#8217;s</a>, an eclectic place serving British eats in Gas City, between Indianapolis and Fort Wayne. I came across it as we were driving down and wanted to stop at a place to eat, so I googled something like, &#8220;dinner along i-69 towards Indianapolis&#8221; and found this gem of a place!</li>
<li>Bee coffee roasters across the street from the convention. I was able to get 10% off with a coupon each time (<a href="https://www.visitindy.com/web_coupons/377" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">I printed multiple</a> after pasting screenshots multiple times into one document with MS Paint) and on my 3rd purchase, they took my address down for a free Bee Coffee Roasters 6d die (they had issues with shipment not arriving before the con); <a href="https://www.tinkercoffee.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tinker Coffee Co.</a> also had some good quality coffee, but only encountered their nitro cold brew from a local market (Wildwood) and the beans that our first airbnb provided</li>
<li>Tried fresh yellow (or was it blue) oyster mushroom from the 4-minute drive to Wildwood Market from our 1st Airbnb. That market had some neat local food choices so I made dinner on the first night with local ingredients: fungi, yellow cherry tomatoes, and some snow peas.<br />
<figure id="attachment_6626" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-6626" style="width: 225px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="size-medium wp-image-6626" src="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/riogrande-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300" srcset="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/riogrande-225x300.jpg 225w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/riogrande-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/riogrande-1568x2091.jpg 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-6626" class="wp-caption-text">Thank you for my favourite meal at Gen Con yet, Rio Grande!</figcaption></figure></li>
<li>Rio Grande shared their hot catered food with whomever was there, so we happened to be around for a breakfast and a couple of mid-day / later-evening meals. They had the BEST prime rib &#8211; coffee rubbed and marbled and cooked just right with an abundance of (much needed) vegetables and potatoes; this was easily our favourite meal (and a second dinner, after having some bar bites at Weber Grill earlier).</li>
<li><a href="https://greenleafjuice.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Greenleaf juicing company</a>: this place reminded me of Pure in DTK but I was happy to stumble across it even though it was pretty pricey, because I felt like I needed some greens in my diet to balance out the Con diet</li>

<p><figure id="attachment_6625" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-6625" style="width: 225px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="size-medium wp-image-6625" src="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_0698-e1533877572671-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300" srcset="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_0698-e1533877572671-225x300.jpg 225w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_0698-e1533877572671-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_0698-e1533877572671-1568x2091.jpg 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-6625" class="wp-caption-text">Deep-fried butter, a repeat from last time. Except he had them all&#8230;</figcaption></figure><br />
j.w took a break with me to check out the Indiana State Fair on Friday night, as I had wanted to see the hot air balloon parade, but due to winds, they couldn&#8217;t inflate so it was cancelled <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f641.png" alt="🙁" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />  Well, at least we saw a tractor parade, which was different than any parade I&#8217;ve seen. We also spent a lot on fair food anyway: a revisit of deep-fried butter (turns out that they have been around for over 20 years), deep-fried bacon (tasted like bacon that spent extra time in the pan, but the seasoning and not being too salty was great!), had a garbage burger again (pulled pork on top of pork patty &#8211; and yes, that&#8217;s what it&#8217;s called), and stumbled into the barn with Indy brews! We tried the mead and the blood orange IPA that was in the competition and we liked the latter so much that we headed straight for <a href="https://www.centerpointbrewing.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Centerpoint Brewing</a> right after. The bartender was super nice and let us sample a bunch (complimentary tasting) before we decidedly bought 2 6-packs of the IPA and a growler of the <a href="https://www.centerpointbrewing.com/beers-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Center Perk</a> (coffee stout). Here&#8217;s where he gets extra points: he remembers us on Sunday and welcomes us back, and when he learns our growler exploded in the car (which now smells of coffee and beer), he offers us another on the house [ref] Unfortunately, bad news: the limited run coffee stout was out so we would have to choose another. Sigh[/ref]</p>

<h3>Accommodations</h3>
<p>We decided to go to Gen Con fairly last minute (a few months before) so instead of hotels we went with Airbnb. Usually, if you want nearby accommodations, you go and book it a year before. We did get a chance to see that the Crowne Plaza Union Station had actual rooms in train cars while we were there! They converted an old rail station to a hotel.<br />

The parents put loving words into each scroll into a jar, so that when their child is older and needs a reminder of how much they love him, he can take out one to read it!</figcaption></figure><br />
We spent the first two nights in a refurbished house that smelled like stale cigarette smoke, with all the basic essentials &#8211; the neighbourhood looked more run down though with empty stores and 4 police cruisers and two on the ground in handcuffs just on the corner of our street.  The host had add some thoughtful touches such as leaving a bag of some local coffee (Tinker Coffee Co.), some emergency toiletries, and it was almost 5x cheaper for a much bigger space. Conversely, our last-minute booking during Gen Con days meant premium pricing everywhere &#8211; and the host was smart enough to leave town and rent out her unit in addition to the one she normally rents out in the same suite. I loved the stay at the smaller space &#8211; the decor, the comfortable linen and beds, the hair and body wash&#8230;and even the pool was suitable to use at night!</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Gen Con: Thursday through Sunday</h3>
<p>I started off my first day of Gen Con with two non-gaming mini workshops on the art and method of zentangle; everyone else stormed the exhibit hall when it opened. I had a great time doodling with a purpose! The rest of the day, I strolled through the exhibit hall collecting freebies, browsing the booths, and demoing a couple of short games.<br />
Other than me joining the audience to watch an interview with the puppeteer and voice of Big Bird and Oscar the Grouch (who knew that they were played by the same person!) and his wife [ref] &#8211; there was an entire puppet stream / track at this convention, and the puppeteer and voice for Kermit the frog and Ernie (both played by the same person) was also there which I missed! [/ref], for the next couple of days, j.w and I spent most of our time together to look around the hall and demo games (at the hall and CGE/Rio Grande rooms); I found myself playing more games when with another person around than on my own.</p>

We stopped for a bit to see the cosplay contest for the first time as we missed out on the parade as our True Dungeon game took longer than expected &#8211; wow, some people are truly dedicated at hand making their costume!</p>
<h3>Games</h3>
<h4>Notes for next time</h4>
<ul>
<li>the C n C booth resells Rio Grande games; you can bargain with them.</li>
<li>Cool stuff inc has a dings and dents (or last stock) shelf that they restock throughout the convention. You can also use the $2 off coupon in the coupon book with these games.</li>
</ul>
<h4>I would consider buying or playing again</h4>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/257527/trapwords" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Trapwords</strong></a> (coming out in the Fall sometime) &#8211; advanced taboo, best played with people you know</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgameexpansion/233891/ticket-ride-map-collection-volume-6-france-old-wes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ticket to Ride: France</a></strong>: the tracks aren&#8217;t colored ahead of time, so you use one action to assign a color <i>but</i> your opponents could claim it before you do!</li>
<li><strong>Roll for the Galaxy: Ambition</strong>: extra cards and goals to complete. I regret not picking this one up at $23 &#8211; $2 at the dents and dings shelf at Cool Stuff Inc. because I wasn&#8217;t sure how it would play and didn&#8217;t know its retail price (later found out it sold elsewhere at the convention for $40). If they reminded me of the $2 off coupon, I would&#8217;ve picked it up. Though, pro-tip, don&#8217;t do as I did: don&#8217;t play and drink for you might roll your drink cup (filled with coffee in my case) instead of your dice cup. Though now that I know Amazon.com has it for $24, thanks to someone telling me about <a href="http://boardgameprices.com">boardgameprices.com</a> at the consignment store, I don&#8217;t feel as regretful.</li>
<li><strong>King Domino: Age of Giants</strong> (expansion)</li>
<li><strong>drop it</strong>: quick game to play, can play with kids, but hard to master, but would only get it if it was on sale, as the sticker price was $30 USD</li>
<li><strong>Cities of Splendor</strong>: adds a bunch of expansion games to Splendor, but would only buy this if we get a copy of Splendor. We&#8217;ve been playing Splendor on our phones / tablet after a friend taught us how to play, but the feel of the game is nice</li>
<li><strong>Word slam</strong>: A team vs. team game where you use existing word cards to try to and get your teammates to guess the correct word without using any gestures or your voice. It seemed to get a bit repetitive after a few rounds, but I like word games, so I&#8217;d be willing to give this one another try.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Did not get a chance to try</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Queen Domino</strong></li>
<li><strong>King Domino: Age of Giants</strong> (expansion)</li>
<li><strong>Terraforming Mars</strong>: I heard it has a Race for the Galaxy feel to it!</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/244330/scarabya" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Scarabya</a></strong><a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/244330/scarabya" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> &#8211; by Blue Orange, the same publisher and designer of King Domino.</a> I did meet the game designer in person, and it was sort of interesting to see that everyone at the booth was from France except for one American, even though they have an office in Silicon Valley.</li>
<li><strong>trash pandas</strong>: I only found this intriguing because I like the art of Sushi Go and the others at the Gamewright booth like this one looked cute, and was sold out on the first day.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Games I tried that I probably wouldn&#8217;t pay money for</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Catan VR</strong> (needs an Oculus set first)</li>
<li><strong>Small World: Sky Island</strong> (too many pieces! would be more fun to play on a tablet or smartphone)</li>
<li>Other expansions of Dominion (too many cards! but fun to play anyway)</li>
<li>Escape-room type card games. I feel like these are one-time plays and thus a waste of resources</li>
<li><a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/141791/pinata" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Pinata</strong></a>: a two-player game that seems kid-friendly but gets really repetitive quickly (maybe that&#8217;s why it&#8217;s perfect for a mother-daughter game); the consignment store had it for $12</li>
<li><strong>Chicken Cha Cha Cha</strong>: relies on a lot of memory &#8211; great for a younger audience</li>
<li><strong>Codenames: Duet</strong> &#8211; is a fun game but the group game seems more fun</li>
<li><strong>True Dungeon</strong> (TD): when j.w played it the first time, he came home raving about it. I think with the rise of escape rooms, I&#8217;d rather spend my money there (works out to be around the same price per hour). TD was a RPG/D&amp;D+Escape room hybrid: you&#8217;re in the dark going from space to space with divider walls draped with fabric to match the theme to separate the rooms; there&#8217;s a dungeon/game master in each room that yells out scenarios and penalties and then some random actors dressed up in themed costumes. I randomly died in the middle of the game (turned into stone after a low die roll), which mean I couldn&#8217;t participate in 3 out of 6 or 7 rooms, so I feel like I got ripped off somewhat.I felt like there was little to no onboarding for new players (had no idea what happened, and when to dock myself life). At the beginning, we spent a considerable time trying to figure out what our given random tokens meant and how to suit up our character by trading our tokens with others as each one had a special ability or armour/weapon. I wish they explained it better that certain tokens are more valuable than others, such as the purple ones, which are ultra rare (1 in every 100 packs), so you don&#8217;t trade them away. Thankfully, j.w had played before so he pocketed the purple one that I had opened (instead of giving or trading it away) and later found out that it sold for $75, but the buy price was $35, so I guess we got back most of my game. At least I contributed to solving a puzzle fairly quickly before our time was up.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Games we bought</h4>

<ol>
<li><strong><a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/98229/pictomania" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pictomania</a></strong>, newest edition (surprised that it was j.w who wanted a copy because it&#8217;s a group game and you have to draw!) &#8211; a hybrid of pictionary and speed where everyone in the game participates at the same time.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/28620/phoenicia" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Phoenicia</a></strong> &#8211; by the same designer as Race for the Galaxy. Hadn&#8217;t heard of it &#8211; only picked up because it was $10 at the consignment store [ref] future note to self: every day a board game stays at the consignment store, it drops in price[/ref]</li>
<li><strong>Pressure Cooker</strong> &#8211; from Rio Grande, looks like Overcooked and for $10, it&#8217;s worth the try<br />
<figure style="width: 680px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="size-medium" src="https://geekandsundry.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/everdell.png" width="680" height="582" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Image from <a href="https://geekandsundry.com/build-your-new-home-with-critters-and-cards-in-everdell/">https://geekandsundry.com/build-your-new-home-with-critters-and-cards-in-everdell/</a></figcaption></figure></li>
<li><a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/199792/everdell" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Everdell</strong></a> &#8211; definitely my favourite game from our purchases. I hadn&#8217;t heard of this kickstarter game until we passed by the booth on the last day. The artwork was what drew me in first as it reminded me of why I read some graphic novels, then phrases like tableau building, worker resource placement, Race for the Galaxy meets 7 Wonders / Agricola were the right words to hear. This was a game I was willing to pay a lot of money for! The designer, James Wilson, and his wife was there explaining the game and signing the collector&#8217;s edition. I learned that they&#8217;re from Idaho and Gen Con was their first big-city experience. He does embroidery printing as his day job, and that he&#8217;s worked on this game for over 5 years now. They had hoped to sell 100 copies at this convention, but they had sold over 1000 copies by Sunday morning! (so far, I have yet to win a game though <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f641.png" alt="🙁" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> )</li>
<li><strong>Race for the Galaxy: Xeno Wars</strong> &#8211; turns out we already have this expansion, but we hadn&#8217;t gotten around to playing with the extra pieces yet, so I didn&#8217;t recognize the cards (but found the box to be very familiar &#8211; and that was why)</li>
<li><strong>Robits</strong> &#8211; a kid-friendly $3 game for $1 because we had a $2 off coupon</li>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				I can now say that I actually attended Gen Con, a four-day <i>gaming</i> convention. Going in, I expected to see people similar to those in the Math building at school, and see I did! (and now, I was one of them?!) . I&#8217;m glad that I found other activities to do while in Indianapolis to keep me sane, but at least I came back knowing how to play a few more games that I seem to like: Carcassone, Havana, and Egizia.<br />
So what else did I do?<br />
Yes, I went to the zoo, just like I had told everyone I would. And Trader Joe&#8217;s. Despite going to the zoo on my own, I had a really good time.<br />
Highlights?</p>
<ul>
<li>Memorable quotes that I shouldn&#8217;t repeat</li>
<li>Visiting the world&#8217;s largest children&#8217;s museum for free (every 1st Thursday evening of the month). We even ran out of time!</li>
<li>Interesting eats, including asian-style tacos, happy hour $3 deep-fried onion crisps, and deep-fried butter</li>
<li>Touching a shark</li>
<li>Seeing Abraham eat deep-fried butter</li>
<li>Deep-fried bacon (this was really delish: not-too-salty and crispy bacon deep-fried in light batter)</li>
<li>Touching an elephant</li>
</ul>
<p>We ate some of the most interesting foods at the Indianapolis State Fair. Of course, there were the ones we didn&#8217;t try, like chocolate-covered bacon (which I&#8217;m told is a norm now), deep-fried twinkies, oreos, snickers and other candy bars (which isn&#8217;t new), and krispy kreme burgers (patties using donuts as the burgers &#8211; now that is death). I&#8217;m really happy that the guys decided to all come to the State Fair in the end, which made sharing the deep-fried foods more fun! It&#8217;s a shame that it wasn&#8217;t a week later, as we could&#8217;ve also seen Chris Tomlin and TobyMac in concert!<br />
The worship service at the convention on the Sunday was really encouraging. It was encouraging to see that there were gamers who had more to this life than just gaming; a very nice contrast to the talk I sat in during the week, which essentially tried to use &#8220;critical thinking&#8221; to disprove biblical creationism. Their logic seemed to have a lot of syllogistic fallacies, yet they used the arguments to imply that because creation theory has flaws, evolution must then be true.<br />
Anyway, here&#8217;s a quick 5 min highlight video of our Indianapolis trip:<br />
<iframe title="Indianapolis 2010" width="640" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/q8_f5L4AZqk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe><br />
Would I go again? Maybe if I had extra vacation to spare. The extra activities on the side and the company certainly made the trip more memorable. Without them, I don&#8217;t know if I could last at Gen Con for the full amount of time.		</p>
