<p class="has-drop-cap">I have been mentoring and praying for a new grad who has been trying to start her career in UX. One evening, during my time catching up on my Bible reading and praying, I felt God telling (not really with a voice, more like a nudging feeling) that maybe by having left (which was a tough decision for me), it created an opportunity for my friend. Sure, a new role may have eventually been posted, but the timing was probably expedited by another coworker&#8217;s subsequent departure as well. All along her hiring process, we both patiently waited &#8211; her for news, and I to see how the story unfolded! I couldn&#8217;t say with certainty, &#8220;hey, God told me you&#8217;ll get the job &#8211; you&#8217;ll see&#8221; even after seeing that it wasn&#8217;t the right fit for two other applicants who interviewed as well (yes, I knew those people too &#8211; so it felt like I was just watching a movie as the outside perspective looking in).</p>



<p class="has-background has-very-light-gray-background-color">This verse holds true time and time again: <br><em>&#8220;Trust in the LORD with all your heart and lean not on your understanding; in all your ways, acknowledge Him and He will make your path straight.&#8221;  Proverbs 3:5-6</em></p>



<p>Now I&#8217;m intrigued at what&#8217;s in store for me next &#8211; so far, I didn&#8217;t really actively apply to any role -they all sort of happened (update: with the exception of this latest one &#8211; and God turned a &#8220;not possible&#8221; to an offer!). There <del>are</del>were a couple of possibilities I&#8217;m praying through, but at this point, I have the luxury of not having to worry about experience on my resume as much or needing to rely on my income to meet my family&#8217;s needs.</p>



<hr>



<p>In the past year, more people have asked me how I got into UX (user experience). I&#8217;ve told a version of my story to a few people, but it&#8217;s really all God &#8211; really, it&#8217;s been great!  路  Let&#8217;s go back in time&#8230;<br></p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">So my first visit to the optometrist in Grade 9 changed my life. After seeing Dr. Stephanie, I was determined to become an optometrist, to help improve people&#8217;s lives by helping them to see better (perhaps this explains I had kept a colouring book (by Unicef?) around that talked about a possum who went to developing countries to help those with cataracts see again). Research skills kicked in soon after and my academic and career path was set for Waterloo (the only optometry school in Canada that is taught in English; McGill being the other), or so I thought.</p>



<p>I had 3.5 years to prepare myself, my family, and my friends that I was moving to a brand new province, without really knowing anyone there. Well, except I had met the English pastor at the local Chinese church at a conference in Regina a couple years earlier, who had then told me nope, I wasn&#8217;t going to make it into Optometry (of course, I didn&#8217;t listen to a stranger&#8217;s assessment of me!). </p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Eventually however, I ditched optometry in favour of RPW (rhetoric professional writing), <a href="https://her.happyhippos.ca/2006/01/1999-2000-year-two/">switching with relative ease</a>. A friend once astutely pointed out that the seeing metaphor is a theme that carries through this story.  I wanted to become a technical writer; I wanted to write documentation in a way that would be easily understood, and change the way people saw manuals, instead of boring, hard-to-understand, and something to read/consult only as a last resort (to fix a mistake). A couple of courses in information design toward the end of my degree really piqued my interest in UX. I ended up as a technical writer, marketing writer, and finally as a internet content writer (which overlaps with UX writing these days), before I ended up exploring the user researcher vs. interaction designer path. But while I expressed interest in interaction design, I wasn&#8217;t given a UX role until another leader in a different department randomly offered me an opportunity as a project coordinator. Yes, all of this happened by &#8220;accident&#8221;!</p>



<p class="has-background has-very-light-gray-background-color">Looking back, it seems like I&#8217;ve been interested in UX before the term became popular. And since I don&#8217;t believe in coincidences, I see God&#8217;s timing and hand in everything!</p>



<p>Almost 9 years later, I was essentially laid off at the beginning of my maternity leave (they cut my team and position but generously retained me until my mat leave was over). I had intended to quit to be a full-time parent at the end of it anyway, but here was God showing up again, and giving me a really awesome gift: the gift of a year&#8217;s worth of continued benefits and little extra cash to start a new chapter of life.</p>



<p class="has-text-color has-background has-very-dark-gray-color has-very-light-gray-background-color">One day, my friend sent me this message, &#8220;Would you be interested in ux design work?&#8221; My response, &#8220;part-time definitely!&#8221;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Expecting that it was the end of my career (I called it career suicide) when I became a stay-at-home parent, God had other plans when I wasn&#8217;t looking, and gave me a part-time contract in UX that I did mostly remote, with the occasional on-site visit. Contract work became relevant work, because shortly after that, a friend reached out to me (above). I actually expected a no as I&#8217;ve come to expect that local tech companies want someone full-time. But, this <a href="https://her.happyhippos.ca/2017/12/wrapping-up-2017/">kick-started a whole new adventure</a>! </p>



<p>Within a very short time, I slapped together a (terrible) portfolio that was graciously reviewed by a friend who had more experience, recognized the design challenge as being one I had reviewed in detail on the internet prior, but feeling like I didn&#8217;t complete fully complete it and thought I failed the interview, and then somehow ended up with my ideal during-school-hours schedule (with a few full-days here and there) doing interesting work!</p>



<p class="has-background has-very-light-gray-background-color">During my interview before I was hired, I asked what a successful or effective UX Designer would look like in the role, and the answers were &#8220;user research&#8221;, &#8220;testing&#8221;, &#8220;validation&#8221;, &#8220;success metrics&#8221;; so, it’s hardly a surprise that I ended up doing 80% UX research (practice and strategy) and 20% UX design there.</p>



<p>At the start of this year, a bunch of things happened at work, which led to some restructuring and my role changed: 80% of what I was hired to do was taken away. And because I&#8217;m huge on the U in UX, it wasn&#8217;t the right fit anymore so I eventually decided to leave. Actually, I surprised myself, because I&#8217;m usually not one to quit that easily, but it was oddly freeing, and it was good timing, really good timing &#8211; I was able to spend the next few weeks with my sister and her family, and vacation in Orlando after that! Seeing and being on God&#8217;s path is pretty amazing <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				Think daiso, dollar store, aliexpress, plus any facebook mama co-ops, all mixed into one site; one that actually has a better mobile experience than a desktop one &#8211; that&#8217;s <a href="http://wish.com">Wish</a> for you.<br />
I came across the Wish site and app through a Facebook advertisement, and was intrigued because the products were similar to what the co-op groups were selling (often from China) and at much lower prices.  So, I googled. Reviews were mixed, with many poor ratings from consumers, but <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/ryanmac/2016/12/07/wish-ceo-compares-shopping-apps-success-to-donald-trumps-victory-confirms-500-million-investment/#4546098793b3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">write-ups on tech</a> and <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/ryanmac/2016/12/07/wish-ceo-compares-shopping-apps-success-to-donald-trumps-victory-confirms-500-million-investment/#4546098793b3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">business sites</a> and <a href="https://www.therecord.com/news-story/7108343-six-uw-grads-have-founded-firms-worth-more-than-1-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mentions in local sites</a> / <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/stories/waterloo-math-alumnus-named-forbes-top-40-under-40" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">UW</a> seemed to be positive in terms of its success and business model. I gave it a chance though because I ended up finding out that the cofounder and co-CEO was a former colleague/MSN Messenger friend from my UW language lab days, with whom I eventually lost touch with after he moved to Toronto[ref]&#8230;because how many &#8220;Danny Zhang&#8221;s are there in the world, and what are the chances? turns out it was the one I knew[/ref] &#8211; I attribute my impulse buy of Yahoo! stocks to his indirect influence (which ended up tanking and then only finally evened out a couple years ago, at which point we promptly sold it) ← this is to say that I trust-ed him. He&#8217;s a super smart/hardworking guy, so I was super excited to learn about this (ad)venture!<br />

<ol>
<li>Refund policy on goods that do not arrive by the promised date. I just learned that <a href="http://bc.ctvnews.ca/delivery-delays-online-customers-waiting-months-for-orders-from-china-1.3441778" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">packages tend to take forever to clear customs in Canada</a> in general and not necessarily because of Wish itself, so it often doesn&#8217;t get delivered until past the expected date &#8211; one of my first packages was delivered within a month to Kitchener, but it stayed in some facility for two months, and then only came after I got my refund. You do need to stay on top of it and open a support ticket to request a refund though. I have received 6 out of 18 items so far before the expected arrival date; the rest have been refunded &#8211; some of which have since arrived while the rest are still missing or in limbo / la-la-land somewhere. My theory is that their algorithm will self-adjust based on when you tell them that you&#8217;ve received an item (after the expected arrival time has passed, it will ask you if you have received it and if so, when), so that eventually, they will estimate a more accurate (and likely more lengthy) shipping time so you don&#8217;t keep getting free goods.</li>
<li>Additional discounts  &#8211; it uses the psychology of limited time offers (and limited quantity offers) to persuade you to buy something. For example:
<ul>
<li>Group buy pricing &#8211; cheaper if you buy with someone, or if someone buys with you, you get a rebate to be used on your next purchase (by a certain time)</li>
<li>Instant offers &#8211; cheaper by a very small amount if you buy it within a set time</li>
<li>Promotional pricing &#8211; the more you buy and the more you review, the more points you get towards leveling up. Every time you level up, you get a discount &#8211; which expires after a certain time</li>
<li>Cart savings. <strong>Pro-tip:</strong> if you do not need to buy something right away and there is no timed discount offered, leave it in your cart and keep going to your cart and leaving your cart. Some time later, you will be offered an extra 5% off if you buy it right away</li>
<li>Spinning the daily discount wheel &#8211; it seems to be based on items you have viewed or have in your cart, discounted for 10 minutes</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>What do you need to watch for?</p>
<ol>
<li>Don&#8217;t buy anything you need if you need it by a certain time; if history is a good predictor, it can and will take months &#8211; see first point in the section above.</li>
<li>Look at the price &#8211; many times, it advertises &#8220;up to&#8221; a certain % off (either 50% if a referral, or 20%), but I haven&#8217;t actually gotten anything more than 5% off, and I&#8217;m not even sure how to get it up to the advertised discount. Don&#8217;t trust the regular prices &#8211; they&#8217;re over-inflated, and research your prices before buying even with the discounts; sometimes, you can get it locally or elsewhere for about the same price or even lower. And click on the Related section/tab to see if other stores with similar ratings sell it for a lower price. Remember, Wish is not a single store, so if you&#8217;re reading negative comments about products from the Wish site, you need to remember that it&#8217;s likely dependent on the reseller / shop and not Wish itself (similar to Aliexpress, eBay, Amazon).</li>
<li>Reviews. My own rule is to read each product&#8217;s reviews and only buy something that is 4 stars or more with the more ratings the better (ie. 100+), unless you are willing to take the risk and throw that money away should it not meet your expectations. You need to pay for shipping if you send back an item, so most often than not, it&#8217;s not worth it, so I don&#8217;t buy big-ticket items.</li>
<li>It&#8217;s hard to track down a specific item, unless you know how to search for it; if you are just browsing, it&#8217;s a better shopping experience</li>
<li>Clothing sizing is often in Asian sizing. I&#8217;m Asian, so next time I might just go with that because <a href="https://www.wish.com/c/557a85dc8b8cb34ac6ebd5c0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a L dress ended up too big</a> in the bust area despite reviews saying it&#8217;s really small (I&#8217;m a US XS, so I&#8217;m probably 2 sizes up as opposed to 3). I&#8217;ve been trying to avoid buying adult clothing just because you can&#8217;t try it on first, but I find children&#8217;s clothing to be easier to buy as I can always buy larger and hope they will grow into &#8211; that and the price point for children&#8217;s clothing is generally lower.</li>
<li>Know that most products are made in China; they may not be the best quality, and you may be getting a product that is like its brand-name counterpart (or counterfeit &#8211; some product rating comments will say that despite the advertised brand, it&#8217;s not the quality they expect from that brand).</li>
<li>Support, other than on shipping, seems to be miserable &#8211; you get a different rep at each interaction and the reps sound like they follow a script so response is slow and frustrating. Case in point: I tried to get technical support because the app said I had a discount that would be automatically applied before a certain date, but I tried adding items to my cart and the discount wasn&#8217;t being applied. I did get an email reminder saying that the promo would expire in a few days (before the posted date) so I asked them to send my feedback to the technical team; the Zendesk Help thread is still ongoing.</li>
<li>Wish is not just one app / site &#8211; they have a few others focusing on different offerings: geek, home, mama are a few of the segmented branches. However, the user experience is a very disconnected, lacking SSO (single sign on) which means you need to create a separate account for each one and your point and level history starts at 0, despite it selling the same items at the same prices &#8211; for the most part. I have noticed that the separate apps tend to be more experimental first (A/B testing?) &#8211; for example, all items used to have a base cost, with shipping to Canada about $2-$3 for a small package. However, in the separate apps one day, I noticed the same item had $0 cost but the shipping went up by $1-$2; the final total was either the same, or cheaper by $1, so I ordered through the separate app. A few days later, this model was applied on the main site / app (for marketing effectiveness, it does seem that the &#8220;you just need to pay shipping&#8221; model is more enticing than a product that costs money with a lower shipping cost). So my<strong> pro-tip</strong> advice, is that you can look on the other more focused apps / sites if you&#8217;d like, but use the main Wish app / site to buy so you can keep your points in one place (for faster discounts), and you can keep a track of your purchases all in one place.</li>
</ol>
<p>If by now you are as curious as I was about this Wish site, and you haven&#8217;t signed up, download the Wish app (on phone, don&#8217;t sign up via desktop browser), use promo code <em>dpvwsfd</em> to save <em>up to </em>50% off your first purchase &#8211; do let me know if you actually save 50% , because I&#8217;m thinking you&#8217;ll save at most 5%.		</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				It&#8217;s been almost half a year since our little one&#8217;s first diagnosis of&nbsp;<a href="http://her.happyhippos.ca/2017/01/we-are-one-of-those-families/">his peanut and dairy allergy</a>, so here&#8217;s our first update and a few lessons I&#8217;ve learned:</p>
<ul>
<li>The allergist called me one Saturday afternoon, which surprised me as I thought doctors don&#8217;t work on weekends?&nbsp; He told that the&nbsp;blood results for&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioallergosorbent_test" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the RAST test</a> came back: DS&nbsp;would likely have a 50% chance of an anaphylactic reaction to milk, and a 90% chance of peanuts. So nope, not qualified to take the peanut challenge at this time.</li>
<li>He appears to be allergic to other tree nuts, but I&#8217;m not sure which one. How do I know? I fed him a mixed nut butter from Trader Joe&#8217;s which has the following ingredients:&nbsp;Almonds, Cashew Nuts, Walnuts, Brazil Nuts, Hazelnuts, Pecans, Sea Salt; he didn&#8217;t react the first time. The second time? Instant hives, which only went away after two doses of Benadryl.&nbsp;Our next appointment is not until the middle of summer, but at that appointment, we can test for further food allergies like goat&#8217;s milk protein, and the nuts, though I suspect it might be walnuts as it seems that it coincides with peanut allergies; he&#8217;s had almond milk before without any reaction, as well as almond in Chinese soup.</li>
<li>And as mom and son are refraining from nuts and dairy, I have&nbsp;noticed that Bean has asked for dairy items less &#8211; she wants his soy milk, and doesn&#8217;t ask for cheese, milk, or yogurt nearly as often as before</li>
<li>And as a mom refraining from nuts and dairy, I have failed him at least once &#8211; which I feel incredibly bad about. &nbsp;As my body can&#8217;t tell if I&#8217;ve ingested dairy or nuts, it&#8217;s only when he reacts that I&#8217;ve known that I had something I shouldn&#8217;t have had &#8211; specifically, the time when a friend made a special bowl of pasta for me knowing that I couldn&#8217;t have garlic or onions, but she had forgotten I wasn&#8217;t able to have cheese. I didn&#8217;t want to refuse it, so we decided to scrape off the top of it with the melted cheese and I would eat the rest of it. Bad idea. Within 30 minutes of breastfeeding, he threw up. Lesson learned: learn to get over feeling bad for inconveniencing people</li>
<li>Another lesson learned: Be skeptical. When someone tells you that a batch of homemade goodies they received from someone else are said to be safe, but it actually wasn&#8217;t, you learn that it&#8217;s okay not to trust what people tell you.</li>
<li>And, if anyone tells you that there is no such thing as dairy-free chocolate (as I&#8217;ve been told), it&#8217;s a myth; you can find dark chocolate / cocoa without milk, although many varieties&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fda.gov/ForConsumers/ConsumerUpdates/ucm433555.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">might come with a risk</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Dairy alternatives</h3>
<p>Unfortunately, I&#8217;ve noticed that&nbsp;I tend to crave for more sweets because I can&#8217;t readily have them anymore, so in my quest to search for sweets and treats that I can have, I&#8217;ve come to realize a few things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Many products that are nut and dairy-free tend to be vegan and gluten-free. I guess, it&#8217;s a better cost-benefit to sell&nbsp;a product that meets multiple-dietary needs than just one or two.</li>
<li>Be willing to pay a premium for anything that isn&#8217;t mainstream; this is true of organic products, and any specialty products like these</li>
<li>While I initially enthusiastically tried some dairy-free alternatives, I now am wary of trying most of them as I&#8217;ve only found one or two that didn&#8217;t have a strange texture or aftertaste:
<ul>
<li>The <a href="http://sodeliciousdairyfree.com/products/almond-milk-frozen-desserts/mocha-almond-fudge-bars" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mocha almond fudge</a>&nbsp;&#8220;ice-cream&#8221;&nbsp;bar by So Delicious is surprisingly good, President&#8217;s Choice coconut milk-based &#8220;ice cream&#8221; in chocolate and mango is good and affordable; I have yet to try coconut; and, Belasoy dark chocolate pudding is tasty too!</li>
<li>Soy yogurt, coconut yogurt, almond milk yogurt &#8211; strange texture and aftertaste, and unusually sweet if fruit flavoured <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f641.png" alt="🙁" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></li>
<li>Fake cheese, either blocks, shredded, or sliced &#8211; they tend to be okay together with something like melted on top of a burger, but terrible on its own or where it&#8217;s highlighted, like on nachos; I wouldn&#8217;t buy it again</li>
<li>I had forgotten that&nbsp;<a href="http://blog.fatfreevegan.com/2011/10/what-the-heck-is-nutritional-yeast.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">nutritional yeast</a> can be an interesting alternative to make popcorn taste cheesy</li>
<li>The most surprising finds yet:
<ul>
<li>while Oreo and Pillsbury croissants <em>are</em> dairy-free,</li>
<li>many types of margarine are <strong><em>not</em></strong> dairy-free; the ones that are contain artificial flavours, colour and other strange additives &#8211; the <a href="http://www.becel.ca/en/becel/becelproducts/becel-vegan.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">vegan one by Becel</a> is the one I ended up buying and using for baking, but I&nbsp;prefer using coconut oil on my toast now over margarine</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>My favourite stores? Organic Garage in Thornhill, for their discount breads and discount milk alternatives when they&#8217;re close to expiry; and locally,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.cefoodexperience.ca/?page_id=29" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ce Food Experience and Bakery</a> where&nbsp;I encountered the most wonderful nut-free, dairy-free apple pie; her partner has multiple allergies, so they have a selection of safe treats to choose from, and <a href="http://www.sevenshores.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Seven Shores</a> for their vegan menu options (including vegan cheese and ease of subbing avocado for mayo for example) and baked treats (sometimes $1 day-olds).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>The UX of Labels</h3>
<p>I&#8217;m used to reading labels to see if a product has garlic, onion, etc. and how high and the sodium content on the nutritional value chart, but when I&#8217;m specifically looking for allergens, it&#8217;s so much easier when companies decide to highlight them. Here are a few design choices that I&#8217;ve encountered:</p>

<ul>
<li>Graphics and lists that tell you what common allergen they don&#8217;t have</li>
<li>The best is when none of the concerning allergens are listed in the ingredients, and there is a label that&nbsp;enforces that they&#8217;re a facility that&nbsp;doesn&#8217;t even process a common allergen; e.g. &#8220;made in a nut-free facility&#8221;</li>
</ul>
<h4>And then, there&#8217;s the&nbsp;possibility that the product <em>might</em> contain a common allergen</h4>
<p><figure id="attachment_5681" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5681" style="width: 225px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipOnzRsfAoOR8UgSfTQi-pwSnOOWUISg8KMmJg3dBG8A81LetmyqRGJ8FMXxLn6hIg/photo/AF1QipPZEFVH7X6oEm2yBf7jJY7MBjKicmFrmuI5ubXC?key=c19hQmJWSlZhdXRENGdpWnU4d1lhRXBXOURVWG1n"><img class="wp-image-5681 size-medium" src="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_20170218_202116374-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300" srcset="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_20170218_202116374-225x300.jpg 225w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_20170218_202116374.jpg 738w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-5681" class="wp-caption-text">An oxymoron: these cookies are dairy-free, but watch out, they&#8217;re made in a facility that uses dairy&#8230;</figcaption></figure><br />
I have a love-hate relationship with the disclaimer on a product that tells me that it&nbsp;<em>may</em> contain an ingredient that isn&#8217;t listed, or that it&#8217;s processed in a facility or shared-equipment that uses those ingredients. This information&nbsp;is not regulated, and instead seems to&nbsp;be&nbsp;<a href="http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/fn-an/label-etiquet/allergen/precaution_label-etiquette-eng.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">volunteered information</a>&nbsp;&#8211; aimed to help consumers (but&nbsp;allows companies to cover their butts I&#8217;d say); it&#8217;s definitely important to know that a certain product may have been in contact&nbsp;with an allergen, but this information becomes useless in situations where the label isn&#8217;t helpful anymore.<br />
It does help when the labels tell me to consult the website for more information, or straight up <a href="http://sodeliciousdairyfree.com/allergen-information" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tells me&nbsp;what they do</a>&nbsp;on the label to make sure that there isn&#8217;t any cross contamination. If it&#8217;s made in-store, I often find that if I talk to the department in-person or call them, I can decide if I&#8217;m comfortable with their methods of cleaning, etc.&nbsp;I have come to trust[ref]perhaps foolishly especially knowing that this label is volunteered info[/ref]&nbsp;that if a certain brand of food always uses the &#8220;may contain&#8221; label, if this is absent in a product, I take to mean that there are no known possible contaminants.<br />
But, two labels come to mind that have thrown me in for a loop:</p>
<ul>
<li>This box of cookies that have a giant list of allergens that they&#8217;re free from, yet down below in smaller print, it says: &#8220;Made in a facility that uses dairy&#8221; so now, a little doubt creeps in over the credibility of the &#8220;dairy-free&#8221; claim.</li>
<li>Costco&#8217;s rotisserie&nbsp;chicken&#8217;s label tells me that it may contain ALL of the top allergens it seems: wheat, fish, milk, eggs, soy, shellfish, crustaceans, tree nuts, sesame, mustard. REALLY? So, I called our local Costco, and spoke to someone from the meat department who prepares these chickens, and he told me that they prepare the chicken in the raw meat room, so the only risk would be fish (shellfish, crustaceans, etc.). <em>Thank you</em>. I guess you can say everything that isn&#8217;t packaged in the store might be cross contaminated if they prepare food in an open bakery, but I don&#8217;t see bags of apples with those labels&#8230;</li>
</ul>
<p>I&#8217;ve started taking <a href="https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipOnzRsfAoOR8UgSfTQi-pwSnOOWUISg8KMmJg3dBG8A81LetmyqRGJ8FMXxLn6hIg?key=c19hQmJWSlZhdXRENGdpWnU4d1lhRXBXOURVWG1n" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">photos of labels that&nbsp;I&#8217;ve come across</a> as a digital artifact collection of sorts &#8211; you&#8217;re welcome to add to it.		</p>

I had the opportunity to attend <a href="http://www.blnd.ca/#schedule" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BLND</a>, this one-day, full-day UX event (conference) that was entirely <em>free</em> (even the food was free, and the optional bus from/to UW)! By the end of it, I went home impressed at the quality of the talks, the workshops, and the flow of how they managed to jam-pack a day&#8217;s worth of material. This was also the first event where I felt that there was a good mix of community professionals and students, and  got to hear from various people on how they got onto the UX path. I&#8217;ve come to conclude that no one journey is the same, and reflecting back, mine seems just as accidental[ref]but we all know that nothing in life is accidental, and I don&#8217;t believe in coincidences[/ref] as the many who shared their stories[ref]My story? Two English courses in my program piqued my interest, then interactions with those at work, options to either go UX or PM route, and then to research or design route[/ref]. Though, the path can be so much more directed as a student these days, as there are a multitude of programs in this field!<br />
The workshop I chose to attend covered many tips that would have been quite useful in the large corporate environment where I spent a number of years at as a UX person[ref]at a time where UX roles were relatively new and where job titles weren&#8217;t standard across the company or industry convention, so getting HR to recognize that what I did was on par with other peers in the org was only possible with a supportive manager[/ref], and it was a great complement to the keynote talk which reminded us to embrace &#8220;the villains&#8221; (the naysayers or skeptics). I&#8217;m jotting down the condensed / key notes here as I promised to exchange notes with those who went to the others.</p>
<h2>The Art of Stakeholdering</h2>
<p>Workshop by Chelsea Omel (TELUS), Patrick Bach (TD), Markus Grupp (Indigo) &#8211; all formerly at TELUS&#8217; design team focusing on consumer products<br />
Google found me <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/SDNCanada/a-crash-course-in-the-art-of-stakeholdering-patrick-bach-chelsea-omel-markus-grupp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the slides</a>! [ref]it would also appear that 3 of these talks at the other event were given here as well; here is <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/SDNCanada/scaling-service-design-christine-zoltok" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the third</a>. Guess it&#8217;s no surprise that one of the planners of the SDNCanada event was the event organizer for BLND[/ref]<br />
<strong>Stakeholder:</strong> one who has a stake in the enterprise, and involved in or affected by a course of action, who is going to be impacted by what you&#8217;re putting out. The majority of people will not be the perfect stakeholder.<br />
Always remember: it&#8217;s a two-way relationship.</p>

e.g. the word &#8220;research&#8221; could have different meanings for many people (&#8220;market research&#8221;, &#8220;academically&#8221;, qualitative vs quantitative);<br />

<li>Reminder: you might get buy-in into the process, not necessarily into the product / idea, and that could still be considered a &#8220;win&#8221;</li>

<h3>Set the stage</h3>
<ul>
<li>adapt activities to <em>who</em> is in the room,</li>
<li>workshops: to get people on the same page<br />
types:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>showing:</strong> for skeptics, prospects; high-production in quality, simple</li>
<li><strong>learning:</strong> for prospect, eager beavers; e.g. Design 101; case-studies, templates, examples to work through together, coaching opportunities such as journey maps, empathy maps</li>
<li><strong>working: </strong>for champions, eager beavers; have clear objectives, advanced tools, and less prep work is usually necessary; the dream state</li>

<p>Me: In other words, if I was to assign &#8220;competency&#8221; categories to it (according to HR report cards when it comes to self-assessments and performance reviews), this would be key under influence and persuasion.		</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				Taken from the archives of my UX blog, started some years ago. Originally posted: October 22, 2010 | Revisited today, as we&#8217;re using mobile more than ever before.<br />
<a href="http://www.uxwaterloo.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">uxWaterloo</a> is a local group that meets regularly with folks interested in the user experience of products and services. This month, James Wu, a UI Architect, spoke at the meeting about design considerations for mobile experiences. This event particularly interested me, not only because of the topic, but particularly also because the guest speaker is from Kobo, a Canadian (at the time) e-book company (that integrates with Pocket, so you can download and read everything you&#8217;ve saved online offline and without the ads!).<br />
Like many, I have traditionally focused more on web desktop experiences, but I have on occasion needed to design for a mobile experience as well. James eloquently summed up the challenges I have often come across when transitioning to the mobile space, and reminded me of others that aren&#8217;t always thought of, such as:</p>
<h2>Screen Real Estate</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Screen size</strong> (diagonal space)<br />
For example, a 29&#8243; desktop monitor could be 300-500% bigger than a mobile phone</li>
<li><strong>Orientation</strong> &#8211; the changes from portrait and landscape (and vice versa)<br />
What&#8217;s interesting is that during their user research with 1024&#215;600 tablets (such as the Samsung tablet), they observed that users prefered using this size of tablets in landscape format</li>
<li><strong>Screen resolution</strong><br />
Using the same 1024&#215;600 example, you would either have your screen in &#8220;short and wide&#8221; format, or &#8220;narrow and long&#8221;</li>
<li><strong>On screen keyboard</strong><br />
On many touch devices, more than 1/2 the screen is taken up by the keyboard, which would cover anything underneath it</li>
<li><strong>Platform variations</strong> (or device / hardware variations)<br />
The takeaway? Design for different experiences/products; don&#8217;t cram everything into one screen if it&#8217;s not necessary. Why? &#8220;Don&#8217;t necessarily think people use their phones the same way as tablets [desktops, etc.].&#8221; James said that at Kobo, they must design knowing that people will have multiple devices; the experience should be consistent across them, but not [necessarily] identical.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Hardware</h2>
<p>Like desktop computers, hardware varies across different models. For the mobile devices, things like processor and memory are important to consider as it could affect battery life, performance, and even result in side effects like heat. Others include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Removable storage:</strong> the ability to &#8220;hot swap&#8221; a media card while the application is running in either the background or the foreground could cause undesired effects if designed improperly</li>
<li><strong>Interaction mechanisms:</strong> these may effect how a user interacts with an application such as trackballs, trackpads, keyboards, gesture strips (like the Palm Pre)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Gestures</strong><br />
For touch devices, we get into the a realm that is still pretty new. There is not yet official standards for touch gestures and there is limited documentation to illustrate them (James suggested that Apple may currently have the leading edge).</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Core/standard gestures</strong> like tap, swipe, pinch, expand, drag<br />
For example, a more common gesture is the Pinch-Zoom to adjust the font size of Apple devices</li>
<li><strong>Peripheral gestures</strong> may include less familiar gestures such as long press, rotate, shake, sequences<br />
Using Apple again for this example, a less common might be shaking the iPhone to perform the undo action</li>
</ul>
<p>When designing for touch, one must consider gestures could be used in different directions and even with multiple fingers. It isn&#8217;t surprising that some devices even recognize simultaneous touches (imagine designing a piano keyboard app so that multiple keys could be played at once to create a chord).<br />
It&#8217;s also important to provide users with affordances that let them know that features are there, and that they will use. Kobo uses instructional overlays for first-time use, as well as ghosted elements. I tried to imagine what a &#8220;ghosted element&#8221; was based on James&#8217; description and thought of the many mobile games where they use these visual cues to indicate the controls (where to tap on the screen) as a part of the onboarding experience.<br />
Kobo may also add advanced gestures for more advanced users (like a keyboard shortcut on the desktop), such as adding an element of fun by adding a gestural easter egg in the Kobo app.</p>
<h2>User Context</h2>
<p>We must remember that users are likely in different environments and may have more constraints than if they&#8217;re sitting in front of a desktop. Considerations include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Mobility:</strong> device may not be plugged in (may impact battery life for example)</li>
<li><strong>Divided attention:</strong> users could be multi-tasking or looking at the device on the go<br />
[e.g. using their devices while walking from the train platform to catch the connecting train]</li>
<li><strong>Unpredictable surroundings:</strong> things like flakey connections [e.g. online then loses reception while train goes under the tunnel] could impact a download or chat experience</li>
<li><strong>Cost:</strong> How much would it cost by running your application? Unfortunately, not everyone has unlimited data. Some customers pay per byte, and that might mean customizing for wifi vs. data</li>
<li><strong>Others:</strong> the amount of light (dark environment) or even the number of free hands could impact how they interact with the device.</li>
</ul>
<p>I&#8217;ve observed commuters carrying a briefcase in one hand, newspapers in another, and managed to hold a cup a coffee, along with their device. In that case, could they still perform a multi-touch gesture, and would they still be able to navigate even if they couldn&#8217;t?<br />
Knowing what users are doing while they&#8217;re using your product is a good advantage. Lesson from Kobo: James told us of a time when they hid the notification bar, including the time, to minimize distractions while the user was reading. Yet, it didn&#8217;t occur to them that if a customer didn&#8217;t have a watch or an easy way to check for time, they had to exit out of the application. Now, the notification bar can be brought back with a gesture.</p>
<h2>Standards and Expectations</h2>
<p>Customers might expect applications to be specific to their product. When Kobo designed an app that looked like it was for Apple device, Android customers weren&#8217;t happy. But once they took away the &#8220;Apple&#8221; button and changed the color, they noticed a decrease in complaints about the look of their application.<br />
So when designing for a mobile experience&#8230;<br />
&#8230;these are just some considerations and potential challenges that may come up while designing for a mobile product. Others are shared across the desktop too. We can&#8217;t forget who we&#8217;re designing for, the primary user for your product. For Kobo [at the time], it&#8217;s for women in the mid 30-40s, simply because they found that they spent the most money. Who knows, you might even need to take accessibility concerns as a requirement, simply because it&#8217;s the law.		</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				Taken from the archives of my UX blog from awhile back.<br />
Originally posted: November 16, 2010 | Revisited today as it&#8217;s still a good reminder since we&#8217;re using mobile more so than ever.<br />
I came across a <a href="http://www.lukew.com/presos/preso.asp?26">presentation on mobile design by Luke Wroblewski</a> on the web. I often reference his book <a href="http://rosenfeldmedia.com/books/webforms/info/table_of_contents/"><em>Web Form Design</em></a><em> </em>in my library when designing and reviewing web forms in many of our web applications.<br />
In the presentation, he covered many mobile design considerations, some of which are will be covered in a future post. Here are some specifics:</p>
<h2><strong>Touch Targets</strong></h2>
<p>This is the area where your thumbs or fingers may overlap beyond the target button or control. Some recommendations:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>minimum target size:</strong> 29px wide/44px tall (Apple)</li>
<li><strong>recommended touch target size:</strong> 9mm/34px (Windows Phone)</li>
<li><strong>minimum touch target size:</strong> 7mm/26px (Windows Phone)</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Touch Gestures</strong></h2>
<p>After going through some phone platforms that support multi-touch such as iPhone, Android, Windows, and BlackBerry 6, he groups these as being the common core basic gestures among them:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tap:</strong> briefly touch surface with fingertip(s)</li>
<li><strong>Double tap:</strong> rapidly touch surface twice with fingertip</li>
<li><strong>Drag:</strong> move fingertip(s) over surface without losing contact</li>
<li><strong>Flick:</strong> quickly brush surface with fingertip</li>
<li><strong>Pinch:</strong> touch surface with two fingers and bring them close together</li>
<li><strong>Spread:</strong> touch surface with two (or all) fingers and move them apart</li>
<li><strong>Press:</strong> touch surface for an extended period of time</li>
<li><strong>Press &amp; tap:</strong> touch surface with one finger and briefly touch surface with a second finger</li>
<li><strong>Press &amp; drag:</strong> touch surface with one finger and move second finger over surface without losing contact (using one or both hands)</li>
<li><strong>Rotate:</strong> touch surface with two fingers (using one or both hands) and move them in a clockwise or counterclockwise direction</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Common system actions</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Change mode:</strong> press</li>
<li><strong>Open:</strong> double tap</li>
<li><strong>Select:</strong> tap</li>
<li><strong>Delete:</strong> drag (across item or off-screen)</li>
<li><strong>Duplicate:</strong> tap (source and destination) &#8211; touch object, then touch elsewhere on surface</li>
<li><strong>Move:</strong> drag (and drop) or multi-finger drag &#8211; move one or two to five fingertips over surface without losing contact</li>
<li><strong>Pan:</strong> drag hand &#8211;  move fingers and palm of one hand over surface without losing contact</li>
<li><strong>Scroll:</strong> drag (one or two fingers): move fingertip over scrollbar without losing contact, move two fingers up/down across surface, or touch scrollbar for extended period of time</li>
<li><strong>Scroll fast:</strong> flick &#8211; quickly brush surface with fingertip in the direction you want to scroll</li>
</ul>
<p>LukeW refers to the more complex gestures, that may be unique to specific platforms, as compound or specialized touch gestures.</p>
<h2><strong>Hover</strong></h2>
<p>In this new touch world, you can&#8217;t rely on the &#8220;hover&#8221; action anymore (&#8220;at least not yet,&#8221; he says), and it&#8217;s left up to the designers to find something appropriate in its place &#8211; which I agree with him, hover isn&#8217;t an intentional action; people find information in the hover bubbles accidentally. And yes, there does seem to be a fine line between hover and tooltips.<br />
LukeW&#8217;s advice? Design for mobile first. If you design for a desktop web browser, you may not think of things like the orientation, location input that could impact the UI. From another angle, one could argue that  it&#8217;s probably easier to build it a more complex system (mobile) and remove the unnecessary features (desktop) than vice versa.<br />
<a href="http://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?1071">A more extensive list in available on LukeW&#8217;s website </a>		</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				BTSC, BASC, BPSC, BESC, BRD, BBID, BES, BIS, BDS&#8230;this is just a shortlist of the myriad of acronyms that I encountered at my last job — of course not all of them started with the letter B. I must not have been the only one to get lost in the sea of acronyms because someone put together an acronym dictionary online at one point for people to consult (how many people knew about it is another question).<br />
Guess what? When you enter the realm of mommy-hood, you don&#8217;t escape the realm of acronyms either, especially if you spend anytime online. I remember wondering what certain acronyms meant, and while I could venture a guess at some, others I had to look up as well (trusty Google ← an ironic statement right there). And while some are directly related to your status as a mother, like SAHM, WAHM, DH, DD, DS, LO, EBF, you also encounter ones that are related to buying and selling items such as baby clothing and gear like EUC, NWT, PP, PM. Oh, I just learned about HIPPO and GOAT as I was typing this post, at first puzzled to why animals would represent read or not read the previous posts but then I read what they stood for.<br />
But like my previous job, once I figured them out, I started to use acronym-speak but I still tend to spell it out depending on who I think my audience is. Now, if you don&#8217;t know the &#8220;mommy-acronyms&#8221;, take a guess at some and then check the answers below.</p>
<ul style="font-size: small;">
<li>SAHM: stay-at-home mom, WAHM: work-at-home mom</li>
<li>DH: dear husband, DD: dear daughter, DS: dear son, LO: little one</li>
<li>EBF: exclusively breast-fe(e)d</li>
<li>EUC: excellent used condition, NWT: new with tags, PP: pending pick-up, PM: private message</li>
<li>HIPPO: happily ignoring previous posters, GOAT: going over asinine threads</li>
</ul>
<p>How many did you get right?		</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				Dear Sears Canada,<br />
My friend was right; she had warned me. I had given Sears Canada the benefit of the doubt and had hoped that her poor experience with Sears Canada was a one-off, that the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/SearsCanada/posts_to_page" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tales of woe that customers have posted on your Facebook page</a> were also one-offs because happy customers aren&#8217;t usually as vocal as unhappy customers; alas, my first end-to-end experience dealing with sears.ca and customer service support would end in disappointment and ire.<br />
Maybe I shouldn&#8217;t have brushed off my in-store experience, where the clerk successfully got me to sign up for the company credit card, adamantly claiming that the bonus reward card would work everywhere in store, failing to admit that it wouldn&#8217;t work at the photo studio (where we are regular patrons, knowing that it is third-party owned) even to the point of accompanying me to the studio to try to prove herself right because I specifically asked if it would work there and&nbsp; then went back to her informing her that they didn&#8217;t take it when I tried to pay with it.<br />
So, I now had a credit card that I don&#8217;t know what to do with, because I seldom shop at Sears outside of the photo studio. Lo and behold, a few weeks later, my bread machine dies on me and Sears.ca has a Kitchen-Aid mixer on sale for half off!&nbsp; Well, my credit card could certainly be applied there, as with my bonus gift card. Sadly, my attempt at buying one failed: after filling out all my billing and shipping information, it informs me that is $0, and that the item was unavailable. The order confirmation email also showed that I got it for $0 (really? a free product? I had really doubted that it would ship), and only when I called customer service that they then told me it was out of stock.<br />
The poor shopping interface and process left a bad taste in my mouth, but clearly not bad enough to try to buy another item. Being the sucker that I clearly am, I fell for another item that was on sale. This time at least, the site did say that it was backordered and that it wouldn&#8217;t ship until mid-August. Okay, I can wait and do proceed with my order. Except, I don&#8217;t receive an order confirmation via email like last time, nor do I recall seeing a confirmation page.<br />
I call customer support the next day to ask about it, and they told me that they had problems with my credit card. Would they have called me if I didn&#8217;t call them or would the order have been automatically cancelled? Thankfully, the answer was yes, because they called later that afternoon asking for my credit card information again &#8211; though the ideal situation would have been to alert the customer during the transaction online.<br />
It&#8217;s the beginning of August, and surprise: my order shows up early! What a great way to delight the customer! A little disappointed that UPS would just door drop a 26lb box worth over $200 on the porch, but perhaps that&#8217;s not Sears&#8217; fault. I open the door, lug it into the entrance way&#8230;but wait&#8230;WHY did they send me a lower model (I may be poor at numbers, but 100 is not the same as 120!)?<br />
Guess I&#8217;m calling customer service. I know now that our calls are likely re-routed to a call centre in the Philippines, where the agents follow a script, and if you ask too many questions that the scripts don&#8217;t have answers too, they put you on hold as often as you ask another question and send you in circles. For instance, the first rep told me that my package was backordered and that it wasn&#8217;t shipped yet. No? Then why am I staring at it in front of me? I didn&#8217;t order anything else from Sears Canada. I highly doubt that I&#8217;m getting another package mid-August.<br />
Eventually when I asked to speak to a customer service representative in Canada or put me through to his supervisor, he put me on hold. But instead of a new voice, the same voice comes back on the line and gives me a number to call. I check my phone. Wait, this is the EXACT number I called with the prompts you&#8217;re telling me to follow, which brought me to you. <em>Oh, wait. Do you mind holding?</em> Yes I mind, but I will hold anyway. This time he gives me another toll-free number promising that I will be calling Sears Canada. I hang up, and dial that number. <em>Welcome to Sears Home Services&#8230;</em>wait. I didn&#8217;t buy an appliance or lawn mower.&nbsp; A baby car seat hardly fits into any of those prompts and pressing 0 doesn&#8217;t get me anywhere. He probably just gave me a number to appease me.<br />
Googling Sears Canada gives me another toll-free number, which I try. It gets redirected to a customer service agent with a similar accent. He seems more knowledgeable, but transfers me to someone else who tries to get me to return it to the store for a product exchange. Sorry, I am not going to lug a 26lb box with my baby to the store without a car to find out that you don&#8217;t have any in stock (which they don&#8217;t apparently, I asked him to check for me&#8230;makes sense, since it is backordered until mid-August). I get it, you also can&#8217;t refund anything until you physically get the item but the onus is on you, for sending me the incorrect product. I ask if I could send it via post (since our post office is walking distance) or back with the driver, he finally says yes after putting me on hold to ask his supervisor, and yes, shipping charges will be reimbursed.&nbsp; I try to ask him to email me the address that I should ship it back to, but after 30 mins of back and forth and putting me on a number of holds, the line was accidentally disconnected.<br />
60 minutes of poor customer support.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t call back because I only have a limited number of daytime minutes on my phone plan so I reach out to @SearsAssist on Twitter, to which I get a prompt response but at the end of the day, the box is still sitting at my entrance with this still unresolved. I do hope that I will get my product, and maybe an answer to why Sears Canada tried to send me a lower model of the product I ordered without my prior approval. Had someone hoped that we wouldn&#8217;t have noticed? Isn&#8217;t it reasonable to expect to receive the product that you paid for (or better!), instead of getting one that is worth less&#8230;?<br />
Sincerely,<br />
A customer that feels scammed.<br />
PS. Just saw a link from your Facebook page about the <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/sears-canada-to-lay-off-624-employees-1.2516343" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">three-year turn around plan</a>:&nbsp;<em> &#8220;&#8221;The changes we are making in stores will not affect the number of front-line associates, and service to our customers will not be impacted,&#8221; president and CEO Doug Campbell said in a release.&#8221;</em> If changes aren&#8217;t going to affect customer service for the better, then will your turning around just mean you&#8217;re going in circles? Maybe you should consider investing some resources in user experience to review your end-to-end experience&#8230;mistakes happen, but some of the disconnects could have been avoidable.		</p>

As I look to expand my shrinking wardrobe of existing clothes that still fit, I guess we chose the right Thyme to visit, as it turned out be Mom-to-Be Appreciation Day, which was a very pleasant surprise, as I (and by extension, j.w) were offered bananas, shortbread cookies, bottles of water, and a goody bag with a few coupons, a baby bottle and a cute bib (one can never get enough of bibs it seems!). J.w had a cookie on my behalf (since I don&#8217;t particularly enjoy them), and I had an aversion to fresh bananas last trimester.<br />
Actually, the whole experience was a little strange: this particular location didn&#8217;t seem very spacious, and store wasn&#8217;t full of people so it was a little odd to see 3 employees there, including one dedicated to you, answering questions and trying to find you your size. Part of the problem in many stores, especially this one, is that the sale items are hung from the tallest rack, so that short people have a hard time finding the shirt with the correct size and taking them down! Ergo(nomically), having to crane my neck up to browse through the items certainly motivated me less to spend time looking through them.<br />
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=519167718119294&amp;set=a.161605383875531.29037.153887277980675&amp;type=1&amp;theater"></a> I had to go onto their Facebook page afterwards to verify this &#8220;Customer Appreciation Day&#8221; event&#8230;<br />
Anyway, as I was trying on a few items, one of the ladies knocks of my door and asks me if I wanted to enter my name into a draw. At first I thought it was for a draw that j.w had already entered me into, but she emphatically said it was for a different one: a draw that was taking place right then for a $20 Thyme gift card. Skeptically, I gave her my first name, and 30 seconds later, she comes back to tell me that I won!<br />
I finished up and asked j.w in Chinese (who was in the seating area waiting), whether that was for real&#8230;it seemed straight out of the movies&#8230;since it seemed that no one else was around, so by default I was the winner?! But, indeed, he had heard her approach the other few women in the store to ask for their names too, so I guess I was a true winner! Sweet, so I splurged by buying a grey cardigan sweater that was $5 more than the dark blue one simply because it was the more popular color (since it was essentially free with the gift card applied)!<br />
What a great Thyme &#8211; a  great first experience shopping at a maternity store <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />		</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				The last day of UX Week had a great line-up of speakers and topics, with ideas around<strong> social</strong>, <strong>local, mobile</strong> and some of their comments:</p>
<ul>
<li>Facebook&#8217;s ad designer Paul Adams demonstrated that the web is being rebuilt around <strong>people</strong> &#8211; and, it isn&#8217;t surprising that people live in networks, not in isolation, and have different types of relationships &#8211; though I was rather surprised that the average number of Facebook friends someone has was 130-170, seeing that many of my friends have more than that number.
<ul>
<li>In web design, being social isn&#8217;t about bolting on like and share buttons, but rather about the integration of social networks into the site experience itself&#8230;&#8221;you need to <strong>reorient around people</strong>. If not, someone else will.&#8221;</li>
<li>How? The answer was to understand behaviour and motivation, which was completely what Stephen P. Anderson had stressed in his workshop.</li>
<li>&#8220;The reason why people buy one newspaper over another? It&#8217;s because they agree with what their about to read.&#8221;</li>
<li>&#8220;Influencers make us aware; strong ties make us decide&#8221;</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>User experience happens whether you design for it or not &#8211; Teresa Brazen/Kate Rutter</li>
<li>&#8220;I am a nerd&#8221; &#8211; Adam Goldstein, 23 yo from <a href="http://www.hipmunk.com">Hipmunk.com</a>(a travel planning site that I wish I had known about earlier since I had planned 3 trips within a short span of 3 months, based locally in SF)
<ul>
<li>Two strategies in entering crowded markets: yelling or &#8220;smiling&#8221; (services, pleasant surprises). Guess which wins? &#8211; this also tied in well with Stephen P. Anderson&#8217;s workshop on Seductive Interactinon Design.</li>
<li>&#8220;If you&#8217;re in a crowded market, focus on <strong>experience</strong> strategy;<strong> UX is an unfair advantage</strong>&#8220;- which echoed Todd Walthall&#8217;s comment on Day 1 again around experience being the competitive advantage</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Darren David reminded us of design challenges and opportunities that we might need to think about when designing for the future: from desktop browsers, to mobile phones, to large canvas spaces around us, such as this concept video by Corning:
<p><iframe src="http://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6Cf7IL_eZ38" frameborder="0" width="400" height="255"></iframe></p>
</li>
<li>&#8220;You can&#8217;t fire the customer&#8221; &#8211; Nurat Konar, Interaction Designer at Pixar</li>
<li>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid that I am a s***** designer&#8221; on Sarah B. Nelson&#8217;s fear list, to which I was so relieved to hear, because I thought I was the only who self-doubts</li>
<li>Confessions from a UX designer at Google, Jon Wiley: the origin of the Google search homepage wasn&#8217;t truly because of the move to simplicity, but because the founder, Larry Page, didn&#8217;t know HTML, but the move to the new Google design with the focus on whitespace had negative feedback initially (change), but people were soon okay with it. How did these designs get through in such a short period? With support from leaders at the top.</li>
<li>From Rob Maigret within Disney: focus on long-term <strong>relationships </strong>with customers, not short-term returns; put customers first, marketing second: ads are carbs, stories are protein.
<ul>
<li>How did it work for them? engaging in a 2-way conversation when possible, and quality content and storytelling is the core of their strategy.</li>
<li><strong>Go to where the people are, instead of having people come to you</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Funny, how this theme of being social, local, mobile resonated throughout the day, but it&#8217;s not something new, and is being preached at other conferences around town (&#8220;social, local, mobile&#8221; is the quote I stole from a friend who attended Dreamforce &#8217;11 &#8211; also held in SF).<br />
