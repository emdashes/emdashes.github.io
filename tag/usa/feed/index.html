								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				For our first vacation without kids, we went to Indianapolis. <em>for. a. gaming. convention</em>. Yup. I tell people that I had thought we were doing Chicago paired with this (as it&#8217;s on my roadtrip list), but it turned out to be only this. And, in hindsight, probably wise that it was only this, as this was a spending vacation, and by the end of it, we ended taking home some new games, some promo packs, enamel pins, and a few litres of local beer.<br />
Gaming seems to have become more popular over the last few years. Case in point: I spent more time at the convention <a href="http://her.happyhippos.ca/2010/08/indianapolis/">than the first time,</a> the US border guard actually plays Magic: The Gathering (he asked what j.w thought about Core 19), and our server at Payne&#8217;s in Gas City plays Pokémon GO.<br />
<figure id="attachment_6621" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-6621" style="width: 763px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="wp-image-6621 size-full" src="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/steps.png" alt="" width="763" height="383" srcset="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/steps.png 763w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/steps-300x151.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 763px) 100vw, 763px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-6621" class="wp-caption-text">Recorded steps during Gen Con</figcaption></figure><br />
This year, because we were at an airbnb that was almost a 40-minute walk away, we decided we needed to get there between 7-8am to get a spot at the Circle Center Mall garage, which was a few dollars less than neighbouring parking garages. This meant that I woke up too early every day and walked over 20K steps the first two days (when my average is usually between 7-10k) so by the time day 3 hit, I was quite exhausted by 10pm in addition to being tired in the mornings. This also meant that while learning to play Roll for the Galaxy: Ambition (the expansion), I accidentally &#8220;rolled&#8221; my cup of coffee instead of my cup of dice. Gaaah.</p>
<h3 id="firstHeading" class="firstHeading" lang="en">Pre-Gen Con</h3>
<p>I got the most steps on Wednesday, likely from walking through the 100 Acres: The Virginia B. Fairbanks Art and Nature Park, Newfields, walking back to our car from kayaking along the canal, checking out the Stink (a pre-con meetup) to get some freebies and waiting in line for our badges.<br />

<figure id="attachment_6620" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-6620" style="width: 169px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="size-medium wp-image-6620" src="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_20180801_113732-169x300.jpg" alt="" width="169" height="300" srcset="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_20180801_113732-169x300.jpg 169w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_20180801_113732-768x1366.jpg 768w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_20180801_113732-576x1024.jpg 576w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_20180801_113732-1568x2789.jpg 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 169px) 100vw, 169px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-6620" class="wp-caption-text">Park of Laments: a long rocky corridor to reach an enclosed dead end. Photo credits: j.woo</figcaption></figure><br />
I really enjoyed the walk in the park and interacting with the art installations mixed in with nature, like hovering rings and sloped yellow benches, but it was too bad that a few installations seem to have disappeared and the path around the lake was closed due to erosion. There was this one place called &#8220;<em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Park_of_Laments" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Park of Laments</a>&#8221; </em>and it was truly a fitting title as you had to enter a narrow tunnel surrounded by two walls of rocks to get to an enclosed park area where it was essentially a dead end. A less depressing piece titled, <em>&#8220;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Funky_Bones" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Funky Bones</a>&#8221; </em> actually had me humming, &#8220;these dry bones, these dry bones&#8230;&#8221;  (from what lyrics / songs I don&#8217;t know, but they&#8217;re a reference to Ezekiel 37:1-14).<br />
I&#8217;m glad that we finally got to visit the park since it was on a my to-do list from last time, along with visiting the canal. Last time, I saw the surreys for rental on my way to the zoo, but I&#8217;m glad my friend (another j.w!) was willing to do tandem kayaking with me instead! I was a tad nervous as it was my first time in a kayak / canoe without a life jacket but when I asked about life jackets, the rental place said it was only 3 ft deep and comes up to the chest &#8211; and yes we were fine.<br />

<h3>Food and Drinks</h3>
<p>The food truck food around the convention centre was mediocre at best this year, but here were some unexpected finds:<br />
<figure id="attachment_6627" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-6627" style="width: 194px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="wp-image-6627 size-medium" src="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/DSC_1606-e1533879040733-194x300.jpg" alt="" width="194" height="300" srcset="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/DSC_1606-e1533879040733-194x300.jpg 194w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/DSC_1606-e1533879040733-768x1185.jpg 768w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/DSC_1606-e1533879040733-664x1024.jpg 664w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/DSC_1606-e1533879040733-1568x2419.jpg 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 194px) 100vw, 194px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-6627" class="wp-caption-text">Landos: a double shot of espresso with a vegan peach and rose whipped cream topped with golden sprinkles. Perfect dessert with a caffeine kick to continue gaming through the evening</figcaption></figure></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/paynesrestaurant/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Payne&#8217;s</a>, an eclectic place serving British eats in Gas City, between Indianapolis and Fort Wayne. I came across it as we were driving down and wanted to stop at a place to eat, so I googled something like, &#8220;dinner along i-69 towards Indianapolis&#8221; and found this gem of a place!</li>
<li>Bee coffee roasters across the street from the convention. I was able to get 10% off with a coupon each time (<a href="https://www.visitindy.com/web_coupons/377" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">I printed multiple</a> after pasting screenshots multiple times into one document with MS Paint) and on my 3rd purchase, they took my address down for a free Bee Coffee Roasters 6d die (they had issues with shipment not arriving before the con); <a href="https://www.tinkercoffee.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tinker Coffee Co.</a> also had some good quality coffee, but only encountered their nitro cold brew from a local market (Wildwood) and the beans that our first airbnb provided</li>
<li>Tried fresh yellow (or was it blue) oyster mushroom from the 4-minute drive to Wildwood Market from our 1st Airbnb. That market had some neat local food choices so I made dinner on the first night with local ingredients: fungi, yellow cherry tomatoes, and some snow peas.<br />
<figure id="attachment_6626" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-6626" style="width: 225px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="size-medium wp-image-6626" src="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/riogrande-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300" srcset="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/riogrande-225x300.jpg 225w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/riogrande-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/riogrande-1568x2091.jpg 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-6626" class="wp-caption-text">Thank you for my favourite meal at Gen Con yet, Rio Grande!</figcaption></figure></li>
<li>Rio Grande shared their hot catered food with whomever was there, so we happened to be around for a breakfast and a couple of mid-day / later-evening meals. They had the BEST prime rib &#8211; coffee rubbed and marbled and cooked just right with an abundance of (much needed) vegetables and potatoes; this was easily our favourite meal (and a second dinner, after having some bar bites at Weber Grill earlier).</li>
<li><a href="https://greenleafjuice.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Greenleaf juicing company</a>: this place reminded me of Pure in DTK but I was happy to stumble across it even though it was pretty pricey, because I felt like I needed some greens in my diet to balance out the Con diet</li>

<p><figure id="attachment_6625" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-6625" style="width: 225px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="size-medium wp-image-6625" src="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_0698-e1533877572671-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300" srcset="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_0698-e1533877572671-225x300.jpg 225w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_0698-e1533877572671-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_0698-e1533877572671-1568x2091.jpg 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-6625" class="wp-caption-text">Deep-fried butter, a repeat from last time. Except he had them all&#8230;</figcaption></figure><br />
j.w took a break with me to check out the Indiana State Fair on Friday night, as I had wanted to see the hot air balloon parade, but due to winds, they couldn&#8217;t inflate so it was cancelled <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f641.png" alt="🙁" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />  Well, at least we saw a tractor parade, which was different than any parade I&#8217;ve seen. We also spent a lot on fair food anyway: a revisit of deep-fried butter (turns out that they have been around for over 20 years), deep-fried bacon (tasted like bacon that spent extra time in the pan, but the seasoning and not being too salty was great!), had a garbage burger again (pulled pork on top of pork patty &#8211; and yes, that&#8217;s what it&#8217;s called), and stumbled into the barn with Indy brews! We tried the mead and the blood orange IPA that was in the competition and we liked the latter so much that we headed straight for <a href="https://www.centerpointbrewing.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Centerpoint Brewing</a> right after. The bartender was super nice and let us sample a bunch (complimentary tasting) before we decidedly bought 2 6-packs of the IPA and a growler of the <a href="https://www.centerpointbrewing.com/beers-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Center Perk</a> (coffee stout). Here&#8217;s where he gets extra points: he remembers us on Sunday and welcomes us back, and when he learns our growler exploded in the car (which now smells of coffee and beer), he offers us another on the house [ref] Unfortunately, bad news: the limited run coffee stout was out so we would have to choose another. Sigh[/ref]</p>

<h3>Accommodations</h3>
<p>We decided to go to Gen Con fairly last minute (a few months before) so instead of hotels we went with Airbnb. Usually, if you want nearby accommodations, you go and book it a year before. We did get a chance to see that the Crowne Plaza Union Station had actual rooms in train cars while we were there! They converted an old rail station to a hotel.<br />

The parents put loving words into each scroll into a jar, so that when their child is older and needs a reminder of how much they love him, he can take out one to read it!</figcaption></figure><br />
We spent the first two nights in a refurbished house that smelled like stale cigarette smoke, with all the basic essentials &#8211; the neighbourhood looked more run down though with empty stores and 4 police cruisers and two on the ground in handcuffs just on the corner of our street.  The host had add some thoughtful touches such as leaving a bag of some local coffee (Tinker Coffee Co.), some emergency toiletries, and it was almost 5x cheaper for a much bigger space. Conversely, our last-minute booking during Gen Con days meant premium pricing everywhere &#8211; and the host was smart enough to leave town and rent out her unit in addition to the one she normally rents out in the same suite. I loved the stay at the smaller space &#8211; the decor, the comfortable linen and beds, the hair and body wash&#8230;and even the pool was suitable to use at night!</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Gen Con: Thursday through Sunday</h3>
<p>I started off my first day of Gen Con with two non-gaming mini workshops on the art and method of zentangle; everyone else stormed the exhibit hall when it opened. I had a great time doodling with a purpose! The rest of the day, I strolled through the exhibit hall collecting freebies, browsing the booths, and demoing a couple of short games.<br />
Other than me joining the audience to watch an interview with the puppeteer and voice of Big Bird and Oscar the Grouch (who knew that they were played by the same person!) and his wife [ref] &#8211; there was an entire puppet stream / track at this convention, and the puppeteer and voice for Kermit the frog and Ernie (both played by the same person) was also there which I missed! [/ref], for the next couple of days, j.w and I spent most of our time together to look around the hall and demo games (at the hall and CGE/Rio Grande rooms); I found myself playing more games when with another person around than on my own.</p>

We stopped for a bit to see the cosplay contest for the first time as we missed out on the parade as our True Dungeon game took longer than expected &#8211; wow, some people are truly dedicated at hand making their costume!</p>
<h3>Games</h3>
<h4>Notes for next time</h4>
<ul>
<li>the C n C booth resells Rio Grande games; you can bargain with them.</li>
<li>Cool stuff inc has a dings and dents (or last stock) shelf that they restock throughout the convention. You can also use the $2 off coupon in the coupon book with these games.</li>
</ul>
<h4>I would consider buying or playing again</h4>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/257527/trapwords" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Trapwords</strong></a> (coming out in the Fall sometime) &#8211; advanced taboo, best played with people you know</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgameexpansion/233891/ticket-ride-map-collection-volume-6-france-old-wes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ticket to Ride: France</a></strong>: the tracks aren&#8217;t colored ahead of time, so you use one action to assign a color <i>but</i> your opponents could claim it before you do!</li>
<li><strong>Roll for the Galaxy: Ambition</strong>: extra cards and goals to complete. I regret not picking this one up at $23 &#8211; $2 at the dents and dings shelf at Cool Stuff Inc. because I wasn&#8217;t sure how it would play and didn&#8217;t know its retail price (later found out it sold elsewhere at the convention for $40). If they reminded me of the $2 off coupon, I would&#8217;ve picked it up. Though, pro-tip, don&#8217;t do as I did: don&#8217;t play and drink for you might roll your drink cup (filled with coffee in my case) instead of your dice cup. Though now that I know Amazon.com has it for $24, thanks to someone telling me about <a href="http://boardgameprices.com">boardgameprices.com</a> at the consignment store, I don&#8217;t feel as regretful.</li>
<li><strong>King Domino: Age of Giants</strong> (expansion)</li>
<li><strong>drop it</strong>: quick game to play, can play with kids, but hard to master, but would only get it if it was on sale, as the sticker price was $30 USD</li>
<li><strong>Cities of Splendor</strong>: adds a bunch of expansion games to Splendor, but would only buy this if we get a copy of Splendor. We&#8217;ve been playing Splendor on our phones / tablet after a friend taught us how to play, but the feel of the game is nice</li>
<li><strong>Word slam</strong>: A team vs. team game where you use existing word cards to try to and get your teammates to guess the correct word without using any gestures or your voice. It seemed to get a bit repetitive after a few rounds, but I like word games, so I&#8217;d be willing to give this one another try.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Did not get a chance to try</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Queen Domino</strong></li>
<li><strong>King Domino: Age of Giants</strong> (expansion)</li>
<li><strong>Terraforming Mars</strong>: I heard it has a Race for the Galaxy feel to it!</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/244330/scarabya" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Scarabya</a></strong><a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/244330/scarabya" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> &#8211; by Blue Orange, the same publisher and designer of King Domino.</a> I did meet the game designer in person, and it was sort of interesting to see that everyone at the booth was from France except for one American, even though they have an office in Silicon Valley.</li>
<li><strong>trash pandas</strong>: I only found this intriguing because I like the art of Sushi Go and the others at the Gamewright booth like this one looked cute, and was sold out on the first day.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Games I tried that I probably wouldn&#8217;t pay money for</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Catan VR</strong> (needs an Oculus set first)</li>
<li><strong>Small World: Sky Island</strong> (too many pieces! would be more fun to play on a tablet or smartphone)</li>
<li>Other expansions of Dominion (too many cards! but fun to play anyway)</li>
<li>Escape-room type card games. I feel like these are one-time plays and thus a waste of resources</li>
<li><a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/141791/pinata" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Pinata</strong></a>: a two-player game that seems kid-friendly but gets really repetitive quickly (maybe that&#8217;s why it&#8217;s perfect for a mother-daughter game); the consignment store had it for $12</li>
<li><strong>Chicken Cha Cha Cha</strong>: relies on a lot of memory &#8211; great for a younger audience</li>
<li><strong>Codenames: Duet</strong> &#8211; is a fun game but the group game seems more fun</li>
<li><strong>True Dungeon</strong> (TD): when j.w played it the first time, he came home raving about it. I think with the rise of escape rooms, I&#8217;d rather spend my money there (works out to be around the same price per hour). TD was a RPG/D&amp;D+Escape room hybrid: you&#8217;re in the dark going from space to space with divider walls draped with fabric to match the theme to separate the rooms; there&#8217;s a dungeon/game master in each room that yells out scenarios and penalties and then some random actors dressed up in themed costumes. I randomly died in the middle of the game (turned into stone after a low die roll), which mean I couldn&#8217;t participate in 3 out of 6 or 7 rooms, so I feel like I got ripped off somewhat.I felt like there was little to no onboarding for new players (had no idea what happened, and when to dock myself life). At the beginning, we spent a considerable time trying to figure out what our given random tokens meant and how to suit up our character by trading our tokens with others as each one had a special ability or armour/weapon. I wish they explained it better that certain tokens are more valuable than others, such as the purple ones, which are ultra rare (1 in every 100 packs), so you don&#8217;t trade them away. Thankfully, j.w had played before so he pocketed the purple one that I had opened (instead of giving or trading it away) and later found out that it sold for $75, but the buy price was $35, so I guess we got back most of my game. At least I contributed to solving a puzzle fairly quickly before our time was up.</li>
</ul>

<ol>
<li><strong><a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/98229/pictomania" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pictomania</a></strong>, newest edition (surprised that it was j.w who wanted a copy because it&#8217;s a group game and you have to draw!) &#8211; a hybrid of pictionary and speed where everyone in the game participates at the same time.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/28620/phoenicia" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Phoenicia</a></strong> &#8211; by the same designer as Race for the Galaxy. Hadn&#8217;t heard of it &#8211; only picked up because it was $10 at the consignment store [ref] future note to self: every day a board game stays at the consignment store, it drops in price[/ref]</li>
<li><strong>Pressure Cooker</strong> &#8211; from Rio Grande, looks like Overcooked and for $10, it&#8217;s worth the try<br />
<figure style="width: 680px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="size-medium" src="https://geekandsundry.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/everdell.png" width="680" height="582" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Image from <a href="https://geekandsundry.com/build-your-new-home-with-critters-and-cards-in-everdell/">https://geekandsundry.com/build-your-new-home-with-critters-and-cards-in-everdell/</a></figcaption></figure></li>
<li><a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/199792/everdell" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Everdell</strong></a> &#8211; definitely my favourite game from our purchases. I hadn&#8217;t heard of this kickstarter game until we passed by the booth on the last day. The artwork was what drew me in first as it reminded me of why I read some graphic novels, then phrases like tableau building, worker resource placement, Race for the Galaxy meets 7 Wonders / Agricola were the right words to hear. This was a game I was willing to pay a lot of money for! The designer, James Wilson, and his wife was there explaining the game and signing the collector&#8217;s edition. I learned that they&#8217;re from Idaho and Gen Con was their first big-city experience. He does embroidery printing as his day job, and that he&#8217;s worked on this game for over 5 years now. They had hoped to sell 100 copies at this convention, but they had sold over 1000 copies by Sunday morning! (so far, I have yet to win a game though <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f641.png" alt="🙁" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> )</li>
<li><strong>Race for the Galaxy: Xeno Wars</strong> &#8211; turns out we already have this expansion, but we hadn&#8217;t gotten around to playing with the extra pieces yet, so I didn&#8217;t recognize the cards (but found the box to be very familiar &#8211; and that was why)</li>
<li><strong>Robits</strong> &#8211; a kid-friendly $3 game for $1 because we had a $2 off coupon</li>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				Our same friends (who we travelled with last time) had a last-minute spot open up in their suite, so we took the opportunity to fly down again to spend 6 days there. What did we do this time?<br />
Unfortunately, it rained every single day. Turned out that we had hit the first week of wet season. And when it rains, the frog-toads come out at night and they just sit there staring at you as you walk by or through their paths&#8230;</p>
<h3>Swimming and resort activities</h3>
<p>Because the resort had a really kid-friendly pools / water play area and some decent free activities to do in the mornings (like kinetic sand play), the kids spent non<span style="font-size: 1rem; background-color: transparent;">-rainy times in the pool; I even found the water-slide quite safe for non-swimmers like myself!</span><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<figure id="attachment_6580" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-6580" style="width: 700px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="wp-image-6580 size-full" src="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/marriottharbourlake-1.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="383" srcset="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/marriottharbourlake-1.jpg 700w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/marriottharbourlake-1-300x164.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-6580" class="wp-caption-text">One of the larger kid-friendly pools. A social commentary on what we&#8217;re seeing more and more: the couple on the left were interacting with their phones while enjoying their drinks instead of chatting with each other</figcaption></figure><br />
And when they were out of the pool, we attempted to play mini-golf but didn&#8217;t actually get through a game because of the poor weather. The resort also had a nice little gated play structure for kids to play on as well, which was under utilized and therefore great when Bean went on to play while her brother was napping back in the room.<br />
One unexpected activity that everyone took part in at around 830 AM in the morning was the false fire alarm, so everyone evacuated with bed head and sleepy eyes. Thankfully, it happened at 830 and not 3AM in the morning, and it wasn&#8217;t raining.</p>
<h3>Museums and science centers</h3>
<p><figure id="attachment_6561" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-6561" style="width: 225px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="size-medium wp-image-6561" src="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/climber-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300" srcset="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/climber-225x300.jpg 225w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/climber-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/climber-1568x2090.jpg 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-6561" class="wp-caption-text">Tampa&#8217;s Children&#8217;s Museum</figcaption></figure><br />
Before we left, our friend told us about a family membership at a science centre in BC with reciprocal memberships in Canada and around the world that you could buy online &#8211; and for 3 years, it didn&#8217;t even cost as much as 1 year at our local museum (which isn&#8217;t as great as the ones we&#8217;ve explored so far).  The caveat is that you can&#8217;t use it within 90 mile radius of your address and within 90 miles around the centre you bought it from, which means we can still visit Science World but not the Toronto Science Centre or London Children&#8217;s Museum with this membership. Seeing that we will likely make a visit to BC and Washington State in the next 3 years, we will definitely try to make sure to use this membership to visit Science World and the flight museum and the children&#8217;s museum in Everett!<br />
Anyway, we used this newly bought membership at Orlando Science Center and drove a little ways out (to sunnier and warmer weather) to Tampa Children&#8217;s Museum and spent two afternoons indoors, in air conditioning and sheltered by the rain. The kids seemed to have a great time, and I enjoyed going through the two places as well &#8211; my favourites were seeing the glee at the silk vacuüm tube in the Science Center and the sand sensory table (made possible by a kinect and a projector!) and the mesh climber at the Children&#8217;s Museum.</p>
<h3>Shopping areas</h3>
<p><figure id="attachment_6562" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-6562" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="size-medium wp-image-6562" src="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/DSC_0842-300x169.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="169" srcset="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/DSC_0842-300x169.jpg 300w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/DSC_0842-768x432.jpg 768w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/DSC_0842-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/DSC_0842-1568x882.jpg 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-6562" class="wp-caption-text">Soap bars at Basin, Disney Springs</figcaption></figure><br />
We also spent some time at the Florida Mall play spaces and walking around and taking the short ferry taxi around Disney Springs (and digging in the dino pit at T-Rex Cafe). For date night, j.w and I went back to Disney Springs to try a VR experience where you walk from room to room immersed in a Star Wars shooting adventure with Oculus packs. It was $30 for about 30 minutes, which I feel is a little steep but I think it was worth the experience. This time, I stopped in at Basin because I read online that you could get soap ends at a discount, and while they aren&#8217;t completely natural (though they do have a natural line), the soap bars look too cool and smell edible &#8211; they remind of Fimo tubes encased in glycerin; the Mickey ear silhouettes looked the most fitting!</p>
<h3>Food</h3>
<h4>Repeats</h4>
<p>We went back to the Southern BBQ place at Disney Springs, as well as Q&#8217;nenans. To my surprise, the FoH manager recognized us and welcomed us back! And then they threw in some chicken avocado mix when we just ordered the bread on the side; talk about excellent customer service! We also returned to Sweet Tomatoes twice, as the kids seemed to eat well there and the prices are very reasonable, especially with the buy $50 get $10 promo combined with a 25% off coupon &#8211; we found out that the prices actually vary depending on location, and the one in Tampa seems quieter and even cheaper than the one in Orlando (~$12 for soup-salad bar dinner).<br />
This time, at Disney Springs, I found a allergen-friendly bakery, but I forgot that I usually find the texture of gluten-free baked goods to be a bit off. Sadly, I also found their loaf cake / tea cake to be overly sweet and not moist enough.</p>
<h4>Fish</h4>

We also tried sushi on a belt at Florida Mall [ref] &#8211; this brought me back to high school or early university days when we went to eat at Metrotown / Metropolis which had a restaurant with this concept; it didn&#8217;t seem to stick around for very long [/ref], which the kids loved, and the pricing wasn&#8217;t too bad for the quality; you just had to know what to order so you wouldn&#8217;t be paying too much in the end. On the last day, we also went to a really good poke bowl place, with huge portions for a really reasonable price; it outshines any poke bowl places I&#8217;ve had outside of Hawaii so far.</p>
<h4>And more&#8230;</h4>
<p><figure id="attachment_6564" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-6564" style="width: 225px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="size-medium wp-image-6564" src="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/DSC_0873-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300" srcset="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/DSC_0873-225x300.jpg 225w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/DSC_0873-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/DSC_0873-1568x2091.jpg 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-6564" class="wp-caption-text">Cooking post-dinner at Wegman&#8217;s, a family-friendly grocery store</figcaption></figure><br />
j.w&#8217;s coworker recommended an Asian fusion burritos place, which she said was &#8220;life-changing&#8221; but I found it super slow (he explained as I was paying that a cook had walked out mid-shift) and it was quite salty, so it&#8217;s not on my list of returns. However, j.w&#8217;s cousin&#8217;s recommendation of Tasty Wok on Imperial / Asian street was quite authentic, despite the &#8220;steam table concept&#8221; name. Speaking of &#8220;steamed table&#8221; / hot foods table, in Buffalo, we stopped at Wegmans for dinner, and their battered fish was really crispy and just really good, except when I went back to get more, they were closing their food offering and had taken any left away <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f641.png" alt="🙁" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> What was really nice was that this Wegmans had a jazz trio playing and a relatively large kids&#8217; play area / corner so you could enjoy your food with live music and watch your kids playing, all for free [ref] plus they also stocked free diapers for emergencies including pampers pull-ups in their washrooms[/ref]!<br />

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				<a href="https://flic.kr/p/21x7ka7"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/4582/38420739036_66e8ef2411_z.jpg" alt="The drive above the clouds" width="640" height="300" /></a><br />
Being in a time zone that is behind everyone else is quite nice: you wake up when the rest of the world is going about their day; it seems to complement well with Hawaii&#8217;s laid-back take in life. But being 6 hours behind meant that every day started early, and especially early for our son the first few nights &#8211; when the sun wasn&#8217;t even up yet. Strangely enough, I would actually have a normal bedtime, crashing before or by 11 pm.<br />
I wasn&#8217;t too sold on Maui when we booked our trip, as I didn&#8217;t really enjoy it last time we were here. But by the end of our trip, I told my sister that we should do this again in a few years; bonus points: the kids had a great time together (no crying in the church nursery)!</p>
<hr />
<strong>Highlights:</strong> Minimal diaper duty &#8211; yay, daddy duty!, local food (poke, ahi tuna, fish tacos, gelato / sorbeto in my case), super nice weather, walking distance to beautiful beach sunsets, laid-back vacationing &#8211; didn&#8217;t feel like our itinerary was jam-packed, even though we had activities every day, and because time change happened while we were gone, we had one less hour to adjust to coming back.<br />
<strong>Low lights:</strong> Lost luggage &#8211; it&#8217;s material but annoying that we lost our epipen, 2lbs of Kona coffee, a brand new jump starter battery pack, and a family photo in a photo frame with two bonus prints from Maui Ocean Center (because it was their first day and they were still testing the waters); I was feeling so smug about being packed for our next trip too. More about that in the next section.<br />
As my family was sick leading up to the trip, I finally got sick on the first day or two of the trip; what was nice that even though I felt perpetually cold inside because I was fighting a fever, I just had to sit outside for an hour or two to warm up. By the second day, I decided to buy some generic cold+flu medication and that helped tremendously.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Flights</h3>
<p>One downside is that Maui is very far &#8211; we chose to board three planes going there, and two coming back. For those on the West Coast, it makes sense, whereas we probably would fare better in the Caribbean &#8211; and maybe it was the time of the year, but the waves were a little too much for the little ones to enjoy. Thankfully, kids were great on the plane; while we had very little sleep, even on a red-eye flight, there were no major crying episodes. Because we stopped over at YVR on our way back, the rest of my family met us there for a quick catch-up over a short breakfast; it was extremely nice to be able to see them! For future reference, it takes about 1.5 hours to walk from the gate in Canada through security and customs to the US gate (and a pee break) with young children; we just made it for boarding.<br />
Strangely enough, after we boarded early and clipped in the car seats, a couple of passengers came on and told us that we had their seats. Sure enough, their boarding passes had the same seats that we did! As I went to try to sort it out with the flight attendants, we discovered that other seats and passengers had the same problem; they called it &#8220;seat tubing&#8221; (or something like that?!) but I couldn&#8217;t find what the problem was on Google. Thankfully, everyone ended up being seated in a seat, and we didn&#8217;t have to move.<br />
<a href="https://flic.kr/p/GsCdqx"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/4566/26555565439_874a9aae6d_z.jpg" alt="A beautiful view approaching YVR from the middle seat of row 19E #redeyeflights" width="640" height="480" /></a><br />
On our way back, at the luggage drop-off, the attendant offered to check-in a carry-on for us for free, so we took her up on the offer, as it meant that we didn&#8217;t have to carry it around with us in YVR. At YVR, the WJ folks were so nice to offer us a ride on a golf cart so that we didn&#8217;t have to walk the long walk from the gate to customs.  At customs, the kind security person just waved us over to the flight crew line and we bypassed 9 flights of passengers, just like that! I don&#8217;t know if we would&#8217;ve been able to sit down and have breakfast with my family otherwise; we only had about 45 minutes to do that even with the expedited process because our flight departed late.<br />
Because it was a carry-on, we had left some of the more important items in that suitcase (like our epipen) and didn&#8217;t have a &#8220;this belongs to&#8221; tag on it. Somehow, in our rush to pick up our luggage at YYZ, we forgot about it, and didn&#8217;t think about it until we got to our Toronto home. But, the airline had not seen it when we called, so somehow it is still missing. WestJet has graciously offered to settle with the amount we claimed or give us a little extra in WJ credits!</p>
<hr />
<h3>Food</h3>
<p>Memorable highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li>Costco sold unique items like poke, sashimi (ahi and marlin), wild ahi and moonfish steaks, Japanese-style boxed and frozen mochi, coconut rolls, Kona and other Hawaiian coffee, local papaya</li>
</ul>
<h4>Sweet</h4>
<ul>
<li>Fruit stands on the side of the street:
<ul>
<li>Creamy, buttery, large <strong>avocadoes</strong> for $1</li>
<li><strong>Passionfruit</strong> &#8211;  2 for $1</li>
<li><strong>Miracle berry</strong>: makes everything sour taste like sour candy! A former co-worker told me about this, so when j.w saw them, I told him that 4 for $1 was worth trying, even if it was just for the novelty</li>
<li><strong>Starfruit</strong> &#8211; 2 for $1</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Maui Gold Pineapple:</strong> it must have been at the end of its season because by the last day or two, it sold from over $1.49 /lb to $0.88/lb for all available pineapple, which were mostly Dole ones; they taste different from Dole.</li>
<li><strong>Candy apple bananas</strong>: native to Hawaii, they have a tinge of orange to them, are slightly firmer, and have a fruitier taste; you can bring this and pineapples back</li>
<li><strong>Banana bread: </strong>yes, surprisingly, market stand banana breads are very moist and tasty; some are even dairy and nut-free!</li>
<li><a href="https://www.hawaiimagazine.com/content/crazy-kulolo-kauais-dessert-staple" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Kulolo</strong></a>: a sweet dessert that reminds of baked nian gao (年糕), made of taro, coconut milk, and sugar (and original recipes call for ti, whatever that is; even the <a href="http://www.geniuskitchen.com/recipe/kulolo-hawaiian-pudding-162954" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">modern recipes for kulolo</a>  seem quite labour intensive!)</li>
<li><strong>Sorbetto</strong> at <a href="https://onogelatokihei.com/menu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ono Gelato</a>: so much choice! If you aren&#8217;t dairy-free, the gelato options looked incredible too. If you have an entertainment book, there&#8217;s even a BOGO free coupon. There was another gelato place that had less choice in N. Kihei, that had a sweet potato coconut milk based sorbetto that was delicious, but I prefered Ono.</li>
<li><strong>Shave ice</strong> at <a href="http://www.ululanishawaiianshaveice.com/">Ululani&#8217;s Hawaiian Shave Ice</a> &#8211; the <strong>mochi topping</strong> was so soft and chewy. I prefered this over Local Boys, as Ululani&#8217;s claims to use real fruit-based syrup but Local Boys uses artificial syrup, even though the one at Lahaina had excellent service; not only did the gal at Local Boys Lahaina give free samples for us (no buying expected), she even gave me half of her pitaya smoothie, because I had asked about it but that side of the store was closed.</li>
<li><strong>Pineapple beer. Pineapple wine.</strong> Good thing neither of them got lost.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.vitacoco.com/products/coconutmilk/original" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Coconut milk beverage:</a> unsweetened and very creamy delicious, especially the Vita Coco brand; I can&#8217;t find it here it seems</li>
<li>Wow Wow Hawaiian Lemonades has freshly squeezed lemonade with toppings and other fruits (and entertainment book discounts and happy hour special pricing)<img class="wp-image-5991 size-full alignleft" src="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/37448161314_4356da751d_z.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="360" srcset="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/37448161314_4356da751d_z.jpg 640w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/37448161314_4356da751d_z-300x169.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></li>
</ul>
<h4>Savoury</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fresh poke</strong> at the grocery store, Costco, fish restaurants; ranged from $12/lb to about $18. Fresh poke meant ahi tuna, marinated in a variety of sauces like shoyu, wasabi, spicy mayo; cheaper poke (and other fish variety) could be had but they were previously frozen</li>
<li><strong>Spam musubi:</strong> even the ones under the heat lamp at the grocery store tasted delicious. I had seen them on a prior trip but hadn&#8217;t tried it before. Shame that I couldn&#8217;t try deep-fried spam musubi at Da Kitchen (has dairy in it).</li>
<li><strong>Pork fried rice</strong> at <a href="http://kiheicaffe.com/menu.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kihei Cafe</a>: sadly, we didn&#8217;t get a chance for a repeat visit. There&#8217;s a kid-friendly room for families to sit and eat (and draw on tables) but it was a little chilly with the air-conditioning on, so we ended up moving to one of the outside patio tables.</li>
<li>Ahi (poke)-stuffed calamari at Cafe O&#8217; Lei: such a casual sounding, punny name for a fancier restaurant!</li>
<li>We also liked Coconut&#8217;s Fish Cafe for their fish tacos, and everyday value &#8211; the Azeka location had better service, but the Kihei one had a lot more space (I&#8217;d prefer the service over space). You can ask me for my toss-away phone number for their points if you go, so you can take advantage of discounts and freebies.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Beaches</h3>
<p>I&#8217;ve discovered that you can be a beach person without needing to play or wade or splash in the water; sitting on the sand is just as nice. Perhaps it was the time of the year, but almost every beach on the map had waves that were quite strong, especially for the kiddies to play in.<br />
<a href="https://flic.kr/p/GBiyBt"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/4525/26653774689_7060878b87_z.jpg" alt="Sunset escape" width="640" height="427" /></a><br />
Comments on the beaches we visited, with my favourite at the top:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://goo.gl/maps/WehMHhAttm32" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Unnamed &#8220;secret&#8221; beach</a>: walking distance away from where we stayed &#8211; there was a walking trail that led to it from the road (no parking). The rocks broke the waves and it was a nice quiet due to the secluded spot; this was easily my favorite spot for the kids and to watch sunsets.</li>
<li><a href="http://mauiguidebook.com/beaches/baby-beach/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Baby Beach</a>, not the one in Lahaina, but the one by Paia: a wall of rocks break the waves so that they don&#8217;t crash onto the shoreline. This also allows for some shallow swimming and snorkeling opportunities to see turtles. Unfortunately, a few beach visitors did not heed the dogs-must-be-leashed rule and our kids were kissed by two really hyper (likely young) and free-roaming dogs (the owners were not in sight when they came up to us), and that pretty much ruined that visit for them. At least the owners leashed them up after this incident.</li>
<li>Charley Young Beach: if you walk it, you can walk to Kamaole I, II, III from Charlie Young; it&#8217;s less busy than Kamaole beaches, but all are good spot for sunsets</li>
<li>Kamaole III beach advertises a park playground but it&#8217;s really only a set of swings; the better playground is at Kalama Park, which is next to Cove Beach, a seemingly popular spot for SUP and surfers.</li>
<li>Kapalua Bay Beach: we were looking for Napili Beach but couldn&#8217;t find the signs for them, so we found this one instead. I wouldn&#8217;t recommend it as it had limited parking, lots of people, and deep fryer smells like onion rings wafting in our direction. However there was plenty of shade to sit under.</li>
<li><a href="http://mauiguidebook.com/beaches/makena-big-beach-oneloa/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Makena Beach</a>: a very long beach &#8211; it takes a while to walk from one parking entrance to another along the beach. It was so windy there that our beach umbrellas blew away; this was where a local told us that the current was stronger at this time of the year &#8211; something to do with leeward / windward tradewinds? [Ed. I hadn&#8217;t read the comments about this beach until now, but it seems the strong currents are normal here]</li>
<li>Kenolio Beach: conveniently located across the street from Ulanani&#8217;s, so if you go near sunset, you can grab a shave ice before it closes and then enjoy the sunset or walk across to look for turtles along the pier (and stay dry while at it!) during the day. Next time, I hope to be able to join this group to go <a href="http://www.kiheicanoeclub.com/guest16.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">paddling on their outrigger canoes</a>!<a href="https://flic.kr/p/21x8pTd"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/4548/38420950046_c41dec15b0_z.jpg" alt="A turtle&#039;s head pokes out of the water" width="640" height="480" /></a></li>
</ul>

<h3>Beautiful Drives</h3>
<p>These drives aren&#8217;t necessarily for the faint of heart, but if you go slow, drive carefully and be alert, the breath-taking scenes make it worthwhile. If you attempt any of these, I would recommend driving during daylight hours as there are no street lights, minimal guard rails, and little to no shoulder; in fact, you might have to share a lane with oncoming traffic.<br />
In order of perceived danger (considering factors like narrow lanes, tight turns, unpaved roads, proximity to the cliff, cattle crossing, weather) where the top is probably the safest:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<figure id="attachment_5986" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5986" style="width: 290px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="wp-image-5986 size-medium" src="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/haleakala-290x300.png" alt="" width="290" height="300" srcset="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/haleakala-290x300.png 290w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/haleakala.png 535w" sizes="(max-width: 290px) 100vw, 290px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-5986" class="wp-caption-text">Our path as recorded by Google Timeline</figcaption></figure><br />
<strong>Haleakala Highway</strong> to the volcano&#8217;s summit (10,023 feet says the sign): the roads look maintained, relatively wide and has reflectors, but here are some things to watch out for &#8211; especially if you&#8217;re driving up for sunrise or driving down after sunset:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cattle crossing: cows just wander onto the road</li>
<li>Weather changes from warm at the base to super windy and cold near the top (e.g. from 26C to 9C); it could also change from sunshine to rain</li>
<li>Fog (or when you&#8217;re driving through the clouds): when it&#8217;s bad, you can barely see anything in front of you; it also just randomly shows up even if it&#8217;s clear as day at the top or at the base</li>
<li>Roll down the windows, open the vents when you see forest trees around you, and you&#8217;ll be able to take in the fresh eucalyptus smell; mmm, breathe it in!</li>
</ul>
<p>Even if you don&#8217;t go during sunrise or sunset, you will feel like <a href="https://flic.kr/p/ZqQmXE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">you&#8217;ve landed on Mars</a> once you get to the top!</li>
<li>
<figure id="attachment_5987" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5987" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="wp-image-5987 size-medium" src="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/hana-300x243.png" alt="" width="300" height="243" srcset="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/hana-300x243.png 300w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/hana.png 731w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-5987" class="wp-caption-text">Snapped from Google Timeline</figcaption></figure><br />
<strong>Pi&#8217;lani Highway:</strong> otherwise known as <a href="http://mauiguidebook.com/adventures/haleakala-backside-kipahulu-to-ulupalakua/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">backside of Road to Hana/Haleakala</a>. The recorded path on the Google Timeline map doesn&#8217;t look as bad as the one above, but it is known for its narrow, and unpaved and uneven roads (single to the point of needing to back up if you meet oncoming traffic), tight turns, and risk of landslides and washed out (resulting in closed) roads in wet weather; thus, I would recommend not taking this route if it has rained at all. Most recommend taking it clockwise so you are not driving on the side of the cliff. At one point, if you are driving slowly enough and then stop on the side and walk over, you can actually see an abandoned vehicle (I keep thinking it&#8217;s a white jeep) that has crashed and fallen off the cliff. At the slowest point, it took us almost 2 hours just to drive 37 kms (with a few stops but quite minimal since we were trying to get out of there before dark and catch up to the other car). The drive reminded at times of the California coast, the Cabot trail in the Maritimes, and what I&#8217;d imagine coastal drives in Europe might be like.<br />

<strong>North of West Maui</strong>: After going through Pi&#8217;ilani and <a href="http://mauiguidebook.com/adventures/west-mauis-north-shore-kapalua-to-wailuku/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reading the reviews and comments about this route</a>, j.w decided it wasn&#8217;t worth it, so we skipped it. The other car was going to attempt it but opted to let their kids play at local beaches instead on the day we went up Haleakala. However, we did drive the part from Lahaina to Nakaele Blowhole before we did Hana, which was probably one of my favourite activities on this trip as I got some hiking in (though j.w got the worse of it as he took one in arms, and one in a backpack hiking carrier UP the rocks) and we saw the <a href="https://flic.kr/p/ZjLm5x">blowhole in action</a> (sadly, I can&#8217;t say the same at Waianapanapa State Park as all we saw was the sign that day); I didn&#8217;t dare to go too close as I was paranoid about being sucked in &#8211; due to the stories circulating online. The drive, though winding at times, didn&#8217;t feel so bad, so I&#8217;m going to assume that it gets bad after the blowhole.</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<h3>Worth mentioning</h3>
<ul>
<li>Maui goes all out on Hallowe&#8217;en: so many costumed characters and almost every place has a treat for the kids. Who needs to go neighbourhood trick o&#8217; treating when you can head to a local mall; you even get treats from restaurants too&#8230;</li>
<li>Wild roosters and chickens seem to roam free everywhere</li>
<li>You can watch hula dancing by keiki (kids) for free (put on by the hula dancing school) at the Cannery Mall</li>
<li>Hawaii state law prohibits touching turtles, so leave them alone if you see them with you in the water!</li>
<li>Whale watching: we tried twice without any luck &#8211; since whale spotting was guaranteed &#8211; once from Maui Ocean Center docks and the other from Lahaina. 3 out of 4 adults in our party got a bit queasy. However, we did spot spinner dolphins (too many to count) on the trip out of Lahaina and they were so social and entertaining to watch!<a href="https://flic.kr/p/22ueXQn"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/4583/39044635481_ae14068a85_z.jpg" alt="Spinner dolphins" width="640" height="427" /></a></li>
</ul>

If you made it this far, congrats! This probably should&#8217;ve been multiple posts, but I was too lazy to separate it; maybe some other time.		</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				When we go on family vacations, I often end up finding myself being our family&#8217;s &#8220;travel agent&#8221;, so here&#8217;s a handy list of what I consult when doing travel research or trying to get the best travel deal for my future reference, and for yours, if you end up being your family&#8217;s travel guy/guide:</p>
<h2>In general</h2>
<p>These are two places I check first for flights and accommodations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Google Flights &#8211; use them to get a sense of what the prices are, and where you might be able to find the lowest price if you&#8217;re more flexible with dates<br />
<figure id="attachment_5515" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5515" style="width: 294px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/flights.png"><img class="wp-image-5515 size-medium" src="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/flights-294x300.png" alt="Google Flights Flexible Date Chart to find the best price" width="294" height="300" srcset="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/flights-294x300.png 294w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/flights.png 699w" sizes="(max-width: 294px) 100vw, 294px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-5515" class="wp-caption-text">To find the price graph or chart, you need to click on the calendar icon in either date field.</figcaption></figure></li>
<li>AirBnb</li>
</ul>
<p>If you&#8217;re flexible on time and destination, you can find some pretty great flight deals on <a href="http://forums.redflagdeals.com/hot-deals-f9/?c=5159" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RedFlagDeals</a> or&nbsp;<a href="http://www.yyzdeals.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YYZ Deals</a>&nbsp;/ <a href="http://www.yvrdeals.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YVR Deals</a> (or other Canadian destinations via the parent company,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ydeals.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YDeals</a>)<br />
For ideas of what to do or eat, I like to sign out books from the library or borrow e-books from the library and jot down common suggestions or interesting ideas and go from there.</p>
<h2>Within Canada</h2>
<h3>Flights</h3>
<ul>
<li>Pick smaller airports if they&#8217;re similar in distance to your destination and price (e.g. Abbotsford over Vancouver, Kitchener-Waterloo vs. Toronto) as you&#8217;ll likely find cheaper parking, shorter check-in and security lines, and friendlier people</li>
<li>Cheaper seats tend to occur between Tuesday and Thursday</li>
<li>Check for the prices of flights&nbsp;operated by smaller brands like <a href="http://gonewleaf.ca" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NewLeaf </a>or <a href="http://flyporter.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Porter</a>, and even the sub-brands of major carriers like&nbsp;Air Canada Rouge or Air Canada Jazz. There are charters too like Air Transat or Sunwing, but I generally avoid them due to size and luggage restrictions.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Car Rentals</h3>
<ul>
<li>Costco Travel Canada, for Costco members; free second driver if spouse is also a Costco member</li>
<li>Priceline &#8211; I haven&#8217;t used them, but my parents have been able to rent a car near the Toronto airport for $10 a day by bidding on a car rental once upon a time.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Accommodations</h3>
<ul>
<li>I find there are less listings in Canada on Airbnb.com (likely because it started in SF, CA, so you might find more choices out West vs East), but one good alternative are bed &amp; breakfasts on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bbcanada.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bbcanada.com</a></li>
<li>If you&#8217;re travelling to a university town, you can always check their conference center or student residences if it&#8217;s during a quiet time of the year (e.g. summer) for private suites, student apartments, etc.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Canada to/from US</h2>
<h3>Flights</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fly from a US city instead of Canada, if it&#8217;s within driving distance; one night&#8217;s sleep and fly package at a hotel (where parking is included when you&#8217;re away) is cheaper than cost of difference in flight</li>
<li>Compared to Canada, there seems to be more&nbsp;competition and options in the US:&nbsp;while there are major US-international airlines&nbsp;(United, American Airlines, Delta), we actually prefer the service and price of domestic-only&nbsp;carriers like JetBlue or Southwest; we have not flown ultra-budget airline, Spirit yet, but seat-sale prices are good, even with the price of one checked baggage ($21 per person).</li>
<li>Honorable/historic mention: Hipmunk.com, once a SF startup, which provides a more comprehensive view of travel duration, prices on&nbsp;discount sites like Expedia, Travelocity, etc., but to be honest,&nbsp;I don&#8217;t consult it as much&nbsp;anymore now that Google Flight is an option.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Accommodations</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.airbnb.ca/c/ewong61" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Airbnb</a>&nbsp;(referral link &#8211; $40CAD for first booking)</li>
<li>Priceline &#8211; many people have booked via priceline, but if you&#8217;re travelling with more than 2, please note that the fine print says that the price is for two, so I&#8217;m not sure how it works if you plan to travel with more (do you pay the difference? I haven&#8217;t ever tried)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.vrbo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VRBO</a> and <a href="https://www.homeaway.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HomeAway</a>&nbsp;&#8211; so I&#8217;m still not clear about&nbsp;the difference between these two sites as they belong to the same company,&nbsp;and they seem to operate similarly to AirBnB but it seems less organized. My sister has booked with them before, for our places in Hawaii.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Car rental</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.autoslash.com/blog-and-tips/posts/all-about-additional-driver-fees" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Note that certain states cover a second driver for free</a>, and some car rental companies will have free second drivers if they&#8217;re your spouse or if you are a member, for example.</p>
<ul>
<li>Costco Travel may have different prices on the US site vs. the Canadian site &#8211; and you need to have separate logins as well; free second driver if spouse is also a Costco member</li>
<li><a href="http://autoslash.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Autoslash</a>: we came across this site from Parents magazine &#8211; if you can&#8217;t find a good deal on their site, if you book via another site (like Costco) and send them the confirmation number, it will look for cheaper options until your trip starts. If you end up booking through them, they will automatically cancel and book the same reservation for you if the price drops before your rental starts! I couldn&#8217;t figure out&nbsp;their revenue model so it seemed too good to be true at first, but it worked out great. We found out the hard way that some companies don&#8217;t include fees in the car rental quotes, but this site breaks everything down for you so it&#8217;s WYSIWYG (or pay in this case). You don&#8217;t actually pay until you get to the car rental counter! If you are looking for a specific service, eg. a shuttle to/from the cruise port, you might need to enter a specific location code, which can be found in the car rental fine print when you search for an itinerary OR you can email them to ask which location offers it (they do seem to know!)</li>
</ul>
<p>So, that&#8217;s what we have used in the past&nbsp;&#8211; if you have any links to add to the list / share, please leave a comment!		</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				Following tradition, we booked a cruise vacation with just our family to end &nbsp;parental leave. This time, to the Western Caribbean. Personally, I much&nbsp;prefer the European cities (or seeing fjords!) but I figured the amount of walking and sightseeing would bore the little ones, so we decided on a Caribbean cruise, hoping that we would hit the start of dry season instead of encountering the end of hurricane / wet season. &nbsp;And since we&#8217;ve been to the Eastern Caribbean, j.w was okay to go on a Western Caribbean itinerary again (he&#8217;s been with his family). As it turned out, I ended up planning most of our vacation, including flights, car rentals, shore itineraries and accommodations, which was stressful and disappointing at times, but at least one of us knew what to expect. I didn&#8217;t think I w as a beach person, and if you had asked me to choose between relaxing at a beach and walking around a historic or coastal city, I would have definitely chosen&nbsp;the latter (I still might). In my mind, &nbsp;if you&#8217;ve seen one beach, you&#8217;ve seen them all. But just like how Italy converted me into a coffee drinker, it seems that this trip may have changed my perspective of island / tropical beaches. I still don&#8217;t like spending time in the water, but I&nbsp;would be happy sitting on a lounge chair under some palm trees soaking in the sunlight and ocean breeze. While I would have preferred to be able to read a book or magazine, entertaining a curious baby with sand was an okay alternative. I&#8217;m still not a museum person though &#8211; I will go but won&#8217;t spend hours reading every panel[ref]children and science museums tend to be an exception as they are more interactive, so maybe it&#8217;s more how they deliver the material[/ref] In the end, I&#8217;m glad we went with the beach climate &#8211; Bean loved the water and the beach, the island beaches were calm, in contrast with&nbsp;the crashing waves in Southern Florida so she got over her timidness quite quickly!</p>
<h2>Flights</h2>
<p>When I booked our flights, I didn&#8217;t realize that we were flying on American Thanksgiving[ref]in my excitement, I had failed to realize that the Thanksgiving Christmas parade was taking place as we were landing, so it was on our schedule but we ended up missing seeing a&nbsp;winter holiday parade in warm weather[/ref], and had I waited to buy our tickets, we probably would&#8217;ve saved even more as a result of holiday seat sales. But, our cruise agent had given me a Canadian quote of $300 one-way from Toronto, so when it was $150 one-way from Buffalo, I jumped on it. Other than no waiting at&nbsp;customs, I am thrilled to discover that there is now a Trader Joe&#8217;s en route from the Buffalo area. Driving back was no-fun though as the one-year old&nbsp;cried non-stop from there to the QEW, when he finally fell asleep and consequently lost his voice for a couple of days (resulting in whimper cries and hoarseness).<br />
Notes regarding flight carriers:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><img class="alignright" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3c/JetBlue_Airways_Logo.svg/585px-JetBlue_Airways_Logo.svg.png" alt="jetBlue logo" width="161" height="54"/>JetBlue</strong> reminds of WestJet, but with free wi-fi&nbsp;on board and really good snacks (blue potato terra chips); $20US for the first piece of check-in luggage but no weight limit for carry-on items!</li>
<li><strong><img class="alignright" src="https://wieck-swa-production.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/372f5abb7c68f0bca406f561e53098d8484774ed/preview-768x432.jpg" alt="Southwest logo" width="259" height="39"/>Southwest</strong> is great when you have family, as you board after the A group, before the B group &#8211; we would&#8217;ve been B15 even though I checked in right at the 24 hour mark, so you get to choose your own seats first and each seat is entitled to two complimentary check-in luggage&nbsp;(leaving us with a ton of free hands because we didn&#8217;t have to take as many carry-on luggage!); they have free TV that you can stream on your mobile device but no free wifi. Their snacks are also pretty decent (<a href="http://www.belvitabreakfast.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">belvita breakfast crackers</a>), but if you have a peanut allergy, you probably shouldn&#8217;t fly with them as they distribute peanuts.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Miami and its surrounding area</h2>
<p>We&#8217;ve discovered that living in beach-friendly Florida isn&#8217;t cheap &#8211; accommodations, eating out and groceries are expensive! I intentionally chose accommodations near the beach so we could walk there (no need to pay for beach parking), and but even fresh fruit and vegetables and seafood wasn&#8217;t cheap; cheaper than dining out, but I was surprised how much cheaper we get our groceries at home. It is also the last time I order something without inquiring how much it is: a slice of key-lime pie at Big Pink was a whopping $10USD ($13 CAD); thankfully, it was delicious and not neon green[ref]I had wanted to try key-lime pie, since that&#8217;s one of Miami&#8217;s fame, in addition to stone crab and cuban sandwiches &nbsp;&#8211; we got 1lb of cooked stone crab claws at Publix in Hollywood, probably saving at least $10 US+tip but they&#8217;re impossible to crack with teeth but found out that if you manage to break apart the claws, then you can push the sweet, juicy meat upwards and out[/ref]. I surprised myself that without any spices available for us to use, we were still able to make a pretty flavourful cream-sauce pasta with supermarket new england clam chowder, some brussels sprouts, accompanied with stone crab. US should really have Spanish as the official bilingual language; it was everywhere! In hindsight, I&#8217;m glad we didn&#8217;t end up staying in Little Havana (that was briefly considered when I was looking for places on airbnb) because <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/11/26/tears-havana-cheers-miami-news-fidel-castros-death-divides-nation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the party went to the streets</a>&nbsp;in the middle of the night when news broke that Castro had died.<br />
<img class="size-medium wp-image-5424 alignleft" src="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/20161125_104241-300x169.jpg" alt="Trains at Aventura Mall" width="300" height="169" srcset="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/20161125_104241-300x169.jpg 300w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/20161125_104241-768x432.jpg 768w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/20161125_104241-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/20161125_104241-1568x882.jpg 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />j.w humoured me and we went Black Friday shopping, just not at 6am. We weren&#8217;t specifically looking for anything, so we didn&#8217;t need to fight with the crowd. Actually, finding parking was a breeze at 10AM, compared to when we left early afternoon &#8211; cars followed you when you exited the mall doors.&nbsp;Turns out that if you go shopping (at Aventura Mall, not sure if elsewhere) before noon on Black Friday, some stores have exclusive discounts, like an extra 20% off at the Disney Store. We ended up buying 6 pairs of toddler socks for $7&nbsp;at Sears (for the toddler, baby, and myself to use since there was a free soft play area that the kids wanted to play in and the candy store sold one pair of sock for $3 behind the counter), and a $50 shopping spree at the GAP because j.w somehow managed to win a gift card at the Samsung booth after taking a 360 photo &#8211; just because he had a Samsung phone, hurray! That mall also had a really great train set going and an indoor koi pool pond so that non-shoppers had other options too.</p>
<h2>Unexpected surprises</h2>
<p>In addition to the $50 surprise from Samsung, we definitely encountered our share of mishaps / unexpected costs on our vacation &#8211; to the point where I thought that maybe it was a sign that we shouldn&#8217;t have gone:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bean fell down the stairs and bruised and cut her lip and nose a couple of days before &#8211; thankfully nothing was broken</li>
<li>j.w lost his wallet (third time within a few weeks) a few days before we left; this time it contained his newly received IDs, our US credit card and $400 USD. We still don&#8217;t know where it went. Thankfully, he had a temporary paper driver&#8217;s license that was still valid and a couple of Canadian credit cards &nbsp;&#8211; though the rental agencies didn&#8217;t even check for the expiry date on his old one</li>
<li>in my rush to get ready for bible study the morning we were to leave, I had used my wallet to pay for our check-in luggage and forgotten to take it with me. So, no IDs, no health cards, and no credit cards. Thankfully, the second bath of USD was in a separate envelope in my purse and not in my wallet! Guess I wasn&#8217;t going to drive.</li>
<li>When we checked out of our hotel in Buffalo, they told me that the credit card on file was declined! I had prepaid on the Expedia family and friends site, but the hotel had to charge me again. Turns out, Expedia uses their company credit card to handle bookings, so I had to take the time to call and complain while on vacation &#8211; and Expedia made the hotel refund the charges, despite it being <em>cheaper</em> than Expedia&#8217;s rates (I suspect it was the 7-day vs. 30-day sleep and fly package). The hotel (Days Hotel) told me later, that they would match any other deal so I just need to call them and ask next time. Also, do&nbsp;<em>not&nbsp;</em>use a + in your email address on Expedia&#8217;s friends and family site to book your reservation (eg. youremailaddress+travel@gmail.com) because while it will create an itinerary, you will never get a confirmation email and customer support will have no&nbsp;idea why their emails aren&#8217;t getting through to you. I suspect that the &#8220;+&#8221; is a &#8220;bad&#8221; character and does crazy things to their script / code.</li>
<li>At our first car rental (also booked through Expedia, but with our cruise agent from Expedia CruiseShip Centers), we were surprised to see a $32USD extra charge on top of the prepaid amount. Had I known, I wouldn&#8217;t have rented from them. She told us that regardless of who you book with, charges will be added. Yes and no &#8211; we booked our second rental with <a href="http://autoslash.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">autoslash.com</a> and the fees were included in the breakdown of expected costs, so there were no unpleasant&nbsp;surprises (just pleasant ones &#8211; like them automatically rebooking the same reservation at a lower price, or Alamo giving us a free upgrade to a SUV which was much roomier than a standard-sized car and then calling us after our rental to ask how our experience with them was &#8211; talk about good customer service!). *<strong>Update:</strong>&nbsp;Wow, Expedia &#8211; I&#8217;m impressed. Our cruise agent followed up after hearing about our issue and comp&#8217;ed&nbsp;the extra charges. I didn&#8217;t expect the latter, but I&#8217;m thankful that our cruise agent took the time to hear what happened and how it could&#8217;ve gone better. I hope that future customers will be aware of these extra charges, and ideally will find out what they are specific to that location prior&nbsp;to their trip.</li>
<li>Way too many places are closed for American Thanksgiving &#8211; finding a place to eat dinner that night was an interesting challenge</li>
<li>When we got back to Buffalo, after waiting for a while in the hotel shuttle area instead of the off-site parking shuttle area for our ride back to the hotel parking lot, we discovered to our dismay that our car battery had died and needed a jump-start, so our hunger needed to wait. Thankfully, I had snacks for the toddler and she held up! We ended up eating a light lunch followed by a light dinner (back-to-back) but on the way back, our littlest one cried all the way from Trader Joe&#8217;s to the QEW before finally falling asleep. As a result, he lost his voice and his cries the following days sounded like a weak whimper with hoarse chattering.</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, though, it was a good time away as a family, without needing to worry about cleaning the house, making food (except when we wanted to), doing laundry, or running errands. According to Fitbit, our vacation was indeed a time of rest; the average sleep went up just shy of 7 hours for the week, from about 6 hours or less before and after.<br />
Since this entry started getting really long, even for me to read, I&#8217;ve decided to break it up into a few&nbsp;parts. The next two posts will cover the rest of the cruise and port experiences.		</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				<em></em><em>Warning: long post ahead</em><br />
When my sister invited us on a coastal California drive with them, and then told me that her husband was willing to forgo the convertible to rent a minivan and even offered to drive the entire way (j.w didn&#8217;t want to drive while on vacation and I don&#8217;t like driving vans), we took them up on the offer! We&#8217;ve been back for over a month now, and it&#8217;s taken way to long to filter through everyone&#8217;s photos, but they serve as great visual reminders of our vacation. Bean has come back with a souvenir: tan lines from the California sun. Despite not having very many beach destinations or beach days, she managed to get the sandal tan line! ($10 parking at state beaches wasn&#8217;t uncommon, so we didn&#8217;t stop at too many as we weren&#8217;t going to spend very long there)</p>
<h3>California</h3>
<p>I had mixed feelings about California. I especially enjoyed sitting up front, peering out the windshield as we drove along the coast, and parts of it reminded me of Hawaii or even parts of the Rockies / Cabot Trail, NS, but it just happened that it was cloudy or cooler on many days we were outside &#8211; especially after leaving San Diego. The temperature hovered at or around 20C / 68F, which made me want to stay inside the vehicle even more (call me acclimatized to our weather, but my ideal comfort is 22-24C).&nbsp;<br />
<figure id="attachment_4587" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4587" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/IMG_20150607_172744.png"><img class="wp-image-4587 size-medium" src="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/IMG_20150607_172744-300x300.png" alt="17C" height="300" width="300" srcset="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/IMG_20150607_172744-300x300.png 300w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/IMG_20150607_172744-150x150.png 150w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/IMG_20150607_172744.png 720w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-4587" class="wp-caption-text">The weather on my birthday &#8211; tad chilly.</figcaption></figure><br />
What struck me was the contrast as we drove through the different parts so that if you blinked, you might miss small details, like not seeing cacti as regular occurrences on the side of the road anymore as you drove further north or seeing the vast differences between neighbouring places (i.e. Laguna Beach: Spanish-style architecture; Newport Beach: modern and wealthy as reflected by Mclaren, Maserati, and Ferrari dealerships within a short distance of each other;&nbsp; Huntington Beach: industrial). The stark contrast between the idyllic coastal towns and the city were immediately felt once we hit traffic in the Bay area, which made me a bit sad as it indicated our vacation was soon coming to a close, and even though I wasn&#8217;t driving, it still triggered a feeling of stress in me.<br />
True to my memory, Californian fruit is much more fragrant than US fruit we buy at our grocery stores. While we didn&#8217;t get to enjoy avocados much (due to the ongoing drought), we had plenty of strawberries, cherries, and nectarine / peach, as well as tree-ripened oranges and lemon near Santa Barbara.<br />

<h3><script src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" async="" charset="utf-8"></script>Itinerary</h3>
<p>Travelling with six in one vehicle &#8211; two families, two toddlers, one pregnant mom &#8211; is  an adventure in itself and requires flexibility, creativity, and adaptability. I basically set little to no expectations in terms of meeting timelines or destination wishes and that actually worked out very well. The highlights that we did see I was really happy about, but some unplanned stops also turned out to pleasant surprises. I was initially a bit disappointed that we didn&#8217;t visit many of the food places on my list, but after eating out for at least two times a day, every day, eating out was just another meal &#8211; it was a strange feeling. Looking back, a Thai-style curry dinner, a bowl of ramen, and a Chinese-banquet style feast ended up being memorable along with two other meals, so maybe it&#8217;s the Asian in me missing Asian food (just visually looking at poke made me want a bowl!). McDonald&#8217;s has 20 nuggets for $5 though and jalapeño beef or chicken burgers for just $2! Here&#8217;s a summary of where we ended up:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>LAX:</strong> <em>Roscoe&#8217;s House of Waffles</em>. I read about this place, and I ended up being a bit disappointed as I&#8217;ve had better chicken and waffles. The plate of $9 gizzards though&#8230;it was seasoned similarly to yeem-sow-gai / karaage and was so big that it took us 3 days to finish it!</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>San Diego</strong>: Costco, Target, <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-broken-yolk-caf%C3%A9-san-diego-6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Broken Yolk Cafe,</a> <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/swamis-cafe-san-diego" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong><em>Swami Cafe</em> </strong></a>(for a delicious brunch &#8211; I enjoyed strawberry stuffed french toast and dragon fruit/pitaya pancakes), and the <em>San Diego Safari Zoo</em>. I was impressed at the size of the grounds as most zoos I&#8217;ve been often seem like they don&#8217;t give much as space to their animals. <em>Coronado &#8211; Imperial Beach </em>had a short pier board walk and a little play area for kids and the Mexican chip java mocha ice cream at <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/cow-a-bunga-imperial-beach" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong><em>Cowabunga</em></strong></a> microcreamery was worth it! We missed Old-Town though even though it was on our original itinerary. Because we were at a rental townhouse, almost everyone also had a good portion of ahi tuna from Costco seared on the BBQ. Speaking of which, <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/phils-bbq-san-diego-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Phil&#8217;s BBQ</a> wasn&#8217;t the hype that I expected, but maybe because we have really good southern BBQ spots home in #kwawesome or maybe because it was just too much meat!<br />

</ul>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>&nbsp;On our way to Hope Ranch (near Santa Barbara) for the night, we needed dinner and stumbled across an unassuming fish and chips place in a random plaza. I didn&#8217;t exactly want greasy fish and chips as I wasn&#8217;t too hungry, but their fish tacos and clam chowder was surprisingly memorable (chunky clams, good soup to filling ratio!)&nbsp; &#8211; who knew a $3.25 fish taco order would actually be enough for two small tacos and tasted so much better than any fish taco I&#8217;ve had so far for the value?</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>While we completely missed Point Dume State Beach in Malibu after leaving <strong>Santa Barbara</strong> area later than expected (but were rewarded with a gorgeous morning on the terrace and tree-ripened and freshly picked fruit from our AirBnB stay), we did manage an unplanned stop at <strong>Santa Monica&#8217;s</strong> boardwalk area/Pacific Park, where Bean had her first ride on a full-sized carousel, which she started in tears but suddenly loved once I stopped holding her (only $2 (!) as a child under 4 with an accompanying paying adult is free &#8211; only open on Mondays, Thursdays and weekends before 5pm), and her first ride on a Ferris wheel ($8 but free for child under 3) &#8211; she loved it as she thought it was a (giant) swing! We also happened upon some good iced coffee from the Coffee Bean &amp; Tea Leaf chain.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>We eventually arrived at <strong>Morro Bay / Los Osos</strong> for the night; it was cloudy and chilly. It seemed like walking distance from one end of town to the other, and it seemed a little strange that an Asian-inspired restaurant would situate itself here &#8211; a little gem called <em><a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/nois-little-thai-takeout-los-osos" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Noi&#8217;s Little Thai Takeout.</a> </em>I enjoyed the pineapple curry a lot, and the vegetarian spring rolls were crispy too.<br />

</ul>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;The next part of the drive was probably my favourite, as we made it to a few of the must-see stops on my list: the <strong>Elephant Seal Rookery</strong>, where we saw elephant seals sun bathe &#8211; and while they&#8217;re not exactly the cleanest smelling or pretty animals to watch especially when they&#8217;re molting, flocks of people came to watch them in their natural habitat anyway; and <strong>McWay Falls</strong> at Julia Pfeffier Burns State Park where a short walk led to an amazing view (Yelp gave a good tip to <a href="https://flic.kr/p/uBegnC" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">park further south</a> to avoid the parking fees). We even stopped through some small town before Big Sur to grab some take-out lunch and we were further rewarded with a nice view (and a surprisingly good veggie deli sandwich).<br />

<ul>
<li>We reached <strong>Carmel/Carmel-by-the-Sea</strong> by dinner time, and after walking around for at least 45 minutes trying to find a not too overly priced restaurant that could accommodate a toddler, we settled on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Il_Fornaio" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Il Fornaio</a>. Though, it seems that trying to find a spot for dinner at many restaurants in Carmel on a Sunday night without reservations is a challenge. Despite it being a chain, the food was surprisingly flavourful and the texture seemed right (self-advertised in-house made pasta better be!) and the menu offered Italian dishes with a twist, like butternut squash ravioli (it was good! but a bit on the heavy side &#8211; let&#8217;s say it&#8217;s from the olive oil). Oddly enough as we were restaurant hunting, j.w bumped into someone he knew that went to his church many years ago (he seems to bump into people at the oddest places, like at the Anchorage airport).</li>
<li>We spent my birthday in <strong>Monterey / Carmel area</strong>, starting the Sunday morning off at Monterey Church and ending with a value <a href="http://www.thegrillcarmel.com/thegrill/images/pdf/GRILL_SUNSET.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">3-course early-bird dinner for $26.5 at the Grill</a>. I really enjoyed the Sunday service &#8211; especially knowing that Bean was happy at kid&#8217;s church and started to enjoy herself after their joint music time. The children&#8217;s program seemed pretty extensive at the downtown church, but it was surprising that they didn&#8217;t have a potty seat or a smaller toilet for the amount of kids that were there. The music part of the worship service reminded me of a Starfield concert (with the lights, volume, and lyric projection), but I liked how they upcycled palattes to decorate the stage backdrop. The lead pastor is from Altanta and seems like God is using him greatly, as he was invited to speak at a seemingly big worship conference (Spirit West Coast in Ontario, CA) too; I had the impression that he was often jumping back and forth between their churches though. The funny thing is that I stopped noticing his accent shortly into his sermon (side note: the worship pastor&#8217;s name inspired me to toy with the idea of naming our next son, Jedidiah, Jedi for short&#8230;but that is just going overboard), which covered a passage from a different perspective that I hadn&#8217;t considered (except it escapes me right now = mommy brain). I found I also missed times like these where I could focus on listening without the distraction of having to keep Bean entertained (though my mommy side needs to work on trusting strangers to care for her children without parental supervision). Spent the rest of the afternoon doing the 17-mile drive (including Pebble Beach, a paradise for golfers as the green is next to the beach and water!) &#8211; which I didn&#8217;t enjoy as much, possibly because it was cool and cloudy for the early part of the drive &#8211; and ended with making it to our dinner reservations (thankfully, we qualified for that promotion as they didn&#8217;t count the 2 girls in our party so we weren&#8217;t a party of 6. I chose the sand dabs as it touted to be from Monterey Bay, but was a bit disappointed at the dessert as it as just a scoop of ice cream)&nbsp;</li>
<li>Our long-awaited visit to the famous <strong>Monterey Bay Aquarium</strong> was the following day &#8211; I thought it was missing some of the views of a higher-end aquarium, like the fish/shark tunnel, but it was really neat to see the fish feeding shows (especially when schools of fish swam to eat) and the vast size of some of the aquariums. I&#8217;m still not convinced it was worth the price of admission, but j.w figured if you saw 4 shows and allocated $10 for each of them, that would make the admission worthwhile. I enjoyed our impromptu Surrey rental ride, where 6 adults rode with 2 toddlers up front.&nbsp; Bean enjoyed it, but Sum Sum was upset after the adults&nbsp; coordination meant a slight bump into a post. The passion fruit ice cream at Kai Lee Creamery was definitely a worthwhile stop too! We ended up at their Fisherman&#8217;s Wharf for dinner, with my parents (who changed their itinerary so they could spend time with us and celebrate my birthday) at <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/abalonetti-bar-and-grill-monterey" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Abalonetti</a>, because <a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CHGA-FuWcAAvphS.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the Grotto was outright not-kid-friendly</a>. I was quite happy with my pizza even though originally I had a hankering for seafood (but nothing stood out to me on their menu) and thought the calamari was only okay (lightly battered but not rubbery at least), but I think my sister got the best deal (lobster tail dinner for $24, enough to split for two). I was a bit disappointed to have missed the buck-a-shuck oysters (though they are from Canada)!</li>
<li>In <strong>Santa Cruz</strong>, we spent the morning at Verve coffee, where it felt like a hipster coffee joint; walked along the beach boardwalk, where Bean loved the <a href="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/DSC_0233_edited-1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">gondola ride</a> as she thought it was a giant swing; and had a Hawaiian-themed lunch. Missed out on a poke meal that everyone else got, and settled for the loco moco burrito but found it too much on the protein side, so I ordered a rice wrapped spring roll, which seemed to balance it out. This was our last destination (though we did do a short drive through Half Moon Bay) before we hit the city.</li>
<li><strong>San Francisco and beyond</strong>: First dinner at <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/ramen-yamadaya-san-francisco" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Yamadaya Ramen</a> &#8211; service was a bit mixed-up but I was happy with my food- especially the thick noodles. We didn&#8217;t see much of SF actually due to the limited time we had; the Golden Gate bridge was covered in the famous San Francisco fog, even though Alcatraz could be seen in full site in the opposite direction. We did manage a lunch at Google &#8211; great&nbsp; food for free! &#8211; followed by a play date at a nearby playground and another dinner &#8211; free buffet &#8211; at Twitter! I preferred the personality of the Twitter public spaces than Google&#8217;s, perhaps because Google reminded me of Microsoft&#8217;s corporate feel. Even the elevators at Twitter felt cooler: you tell it what floor you&#8217;d like to go to before you go in, and they send the appropriate elevator to you. We happened upon Chairman Bao&#8217;s food truck, but I thought it wasn&#8217;t as good this time around, and we lined up for an hour for the Powell-Hyde cable car ride (courtesy of our friends and hosts) which Bean loved, but Sum hated. On a rare rainy day, we spent it at the <strong>Children&#8217;s Discovery Museum in San José</strong>, where I learned that Vietnamese is quite prominent in that neighbourhood and where I loved watching Bean enjoy herself there &#8211; spending most of her time in the early years area &#8211; making the $12 admission for everyone over 1-year-old worthwhile, and then shopping at the Premium Outlets, where you see hoards of Chinese from bus groups go crazy over chocolates at the Ghirardelli Chocolate outlet shop, followed by dinner at the CPK chain.<br />

<p>&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Wedding!&nbsp;</strong>the point and main purpose of this trip. We made it to the rehearsal, albeit late, after hitting traffic out of SF to Mountain View, following a lunch at the Blue Mermaid and me forgetting to give keys to the guys to grab our belongings so they had to double-back (neat to have a trio of chowders but the waiter missed our appetizer order, which I thought he would have mixed up our chowder orders after he seemingly tried to memorize our 6-person order). Sum cried at the rehearsal but Bean cried at the wedding when being pulled down the aisle in a wagon as flower girls. Rehearsal dinner was a sumptuous and scrumptious Chinese banquet feast! Wedding was followed by a lovely Western-style dinner (with grilled not-overcooked glazed salmon!) with the venue at a community center.<br />

<h3>Bean</h3>
<p>Bean has started talking in 4-5 word sentences since the trip, with some tenses thrown in here and there; I&#8217;d like to think the trip was a catalyst.<br />
I had wondered how we would keep two toddlers, especially ours, entertained during the extended time spent awake in the car without resorting to our phones or tablets. The solution ended being a mixture of different things, with these standing out in particular:</p>
<ul>
<li>snacks, especially used to bribe Bean to settle in her car seat</li>
<li>a handmade &#8220;quiet&#8221; book. I thought her favourite pages would be the belt buckle (as she loves playing with those) but it ended being the clothes line and a random pocket on page tacked on the end that just held loose pieces of felt shapes and felt odd and ends. Funny girl though &#8211; she especially enjoyed taking them out and tucking it under her chin or making me clip it on the clothes line. I also quickly discovered that hot glue isn&#8217;t good enough; I had needed to do some emergency sewing with a hotel sew kit to make sure pockets didn&#8217;t fall apart.</li>
<li>drawing with a dry-erase marker quickly ended when it marked up her leggings and the car seat</li>
</ul>
<p><figure id="attachment_4633" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4633" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/camera.jpg"><img class="wp-image-4633 size-medium" src="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/camera-300x225.jpg" alt="" height="225" width="300" srcset="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/camera-300x225.jpg 300w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/camera-768x576.jpg 768w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/camera-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/camera-1568x1176.jpg 1568w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/camera.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-4633" class="wp-caption-text">Pages in her quiet book</figcaption></figure><br />
Although she has potty-trained herself for #2 for awhile now, this trip has evidently shown us that she doesn&#8217;t like going in public washrooms, even with a potty seat. I don&#8217;t blame her, as mommy tends to avoid public washrooms as well. That means she either held it in for the entire day; had many attempts but resulted in false positives; became very upset to the point of crying and holding your hand because she needs to go but can&#8217;t, which was made worse when she was in the car seat while the car was in motion; or, accidentally going in her diaper, becoming very upset at that, and then manage to finish up on a toilet.<br />
Also, when you&#8217;re eating out every day, we ended up giving her normal adult food (and more junk food like chicken mcnuggets) instead of her usual bland diet. My body, especially my gums, also felt the effects of eating out every day, but soon recovered after we came home &#8211; thankfully!<br />
{If you made it this far, thanks! To edit and troubleshoot alignment and bullet issues another day}		</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				This year, both my sister and my mom celebrated some milestone birthdays, so for their birthday, they wanted to go on a trip and they wanted to invite the family along; what a great treat!<br />
My brother-in-law researched the majority of our logistics, but sadly he couldn&#8217;t join us in the end. On my prior two trips to Hawaii, we had only stayed in Honululu &#8211; my first visit only two or three years apart from our second one. Despite having a budget-conscious childhood, we were privileged to be able to travel. By the second visit, I had the distinct impression that Honululu / Waikiki was too commercialized &#8211; at least that was true of Guam; the fishies and the coral population had visibly declined.<br />
My parents and my sister had visited Maui a couple years back, so we spent most of our time on the Big Island, mostly around Kona and Hilo, but we also had a few days in Maui as well. Big Island reminds me of Newfoundland, in that you can rent a car and spend a few days to drive around the island &#8211; perfect for someone who likes scenery and nature, like me, but for those who enjoy shopping, Maui seems to offer a better balance.<br />
So, a run down:<br />
<strong>YYZ -&gt; LAX -&gt; KOA</strong><br />Due to flight fares, we chose to go a night earlier. We found a great deal at Outrigger Keauhou Resort, which closed at the end of October to build up an educational site for the local Hawaiian students, as they are on historical site. God blessed us with roomy flights on both legs: Air Canada and United gave us emergency aisle seats, which are normally premium upgrades. Turns out that this stay was a great start of our trip. In addition to a complimentary upgrade to an ocean view room when we checked in, the lady at the Expedia counter provided a free orientation tour of the island, along with her own personal recommendations for places to eat and visit, including a great connection to a local Macademia nut and coffee bean supplier (Captain Cook Trading Company). God certainly directs our paths, even when we&#8217;re on vacation!<br />
<strong>KOA -&gt; ITO (Hilo)</strong><br />We drove to Hilo first after a nice poke lunch at Sam Choy. It appears that much of their local foods have Asian influence: Japanese, Chinese, Korean.<br />
<strong>Hilo</strong><br /><a title="L1020367 by b.p., on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aimeili/8107483366/"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8047/8107483366_5217b7c8cd_m.jpg" alt="L1020367" width="200" height="113" /></a><a title="L1020169 by b.p., on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aimeili/8067974104/"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8182/8067974104_902d173568_m.jpg" alt="L1020169" width="170" height="113" /></a><br />Aside from the geckos (and the occasional cockroaches) that were clearly not strangers in the house, Hale Luana Makai is a beautiful home. Like Outrigger Keauhou, we are one of the last guests at Hale Luana Makai as they sold this vacation home prior to our visit. The area is in an area of other vacation homes and closeby tide pools for some calm snorkeling opportunities!<br /><a title="L1010920 by b.p., on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aimeili/8107360971/"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8051/8107360971_71f2e6f8e5_n.jpg" alt="L1010920" width="320" height="56" /></a><br /><a title="L1020352 by b.p., on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aimeili/8107476854/"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8335/8107476854_18011166bd_n.jpg" alt="L1020352" width="320" height="111" /></a><br />
Hawaii is home to many exotic plants and fruits, which are naturally tree-ripened, sweet and fragrant. Roadside guava for 50 cents, starfruit for a quarter, coconut and dragonfruit for a few dollars (more expensive than here, but much better tasting).<br />
Some of the most scenic spots are on Big Island: the valleys that haven&#8217;t been commercialized, and home to 11 climates with the weather patterns consistently spot on, especially in Kona: sunny and clear in the morning, and cloudy/foggy in the afternoon. That was a very good incentive to <em>not</em> sleep in!</p>
<p><a title="L1020423 by b.p., on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aimeili/8111279461/"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8467/8111279461_dbec32ec44_n.jpg" alt="L1020423" width="320" height="92" /></a></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Hawaii Volcano Park</strong><br />Unfortunately, most of the day was foggy and cloudy, but we were still able to see the steam and <em>hear</em> the thunderous sounds of volcanic activity, which was a lot more than what we saw at Mt. Vesuvius (or was it Etna?)&#65279;<br /><a title="L1020227 by b.p., on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aimeili/8107460672/"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8190/8107460672_bd87b737c4_n.jpg" alt="L1020227" width="320" height="213" /></a></li>
<li>We spent some time in <strong>Kona</strong>, prior to going to Maui. Our place was right next to the beach, so you&#8217;d go to sleep hearing the waves crash into the rocks, and wake up to a beautiful view. We left just before the big triathlon race, but we saw this place getting ready for the big weekend!<br /> We also watched a entertaining luau at the Royal Kona Resort, and the one thing that stood out the most was not the sunset, the Mai Tai, the food, or the show, but that at the beginning of the show, a man gave thanks for the food, addressing &#8220;Our Heavenly Father&#8221;, and then ended with the singing of the doxology in the local dialect. It made me wonder if they were worshipping the same God?
<p><a title="L1020636 by b.p., on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aimeili/8111348056/"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8472/8111348056_a87b229db8.jpg" alt="L1020636" width="400" height="277" /></a></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>KOA -&gt; OGG</strong><br /><strong>Maui</strong>, on the other hand, feels more commercialized &#8211; more like Guam, less like Honululu. Perhaps it is because we spent many hours shopping and eating yogurt at Yogurtland, to pass time (while waiting for the shopaholics to get their fill). In fact, we went to the same mall, thrice! The mall was interesting though, because everything (like the Kona airport) is outdoors, shielded only by a tent-like roof, but the stores were built with walls and ceilings. However, the one highlight would be the Road to Hana/Hana Highway with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hikes to waterfalls (Twin Peaks)
<p><a title="L1020939 by b.p., on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aimeili/8107502280/"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8050/8107502280_6f83442a61_n.jpg" alt="L1020939" width="213" height="320" /></a></li>
<li>Rainbow eucalyptus trees<br /><a title="L1020982 by b.p., on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aimeili/8107514000/"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8467/8107514000_53bdde4bec_n.jpg" alt="L1020982" width="320" height="213" /></a></li>
<li>Volcano lava tube<br /><a title="L1020989 by b.p., on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aimeili/8107514502/"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8466/8107514502_2a2459e9d9_n.jpg" alt="L1020989" width="320" height="213" /></a></li>
<li>Black and red sand beaches<br /><a title="L1030049 by b.p., on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aimeili/8107511637/"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8049/8107511637_716013d2f8_n.jpg" alt="L1030049" width="320" height="106" /></a></li>
</ul>
<p>We also had the opportunity to spend a Sunday morning worshipping God at a local church, which actually had quite a number of visitors from out of town as well &#8211; mostly Americans. One neat area in Maui was a banyan tree park in the middle of a quaint strip, with touristy boutiques; these trees all were somehow connected to each other!<br />
<a title="L1020880 by b.p., on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aimeili/8111415029/"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8049/8111415029_3bbe22193b.jpg" alt="L1020880" width="500" height="69" /></a><br />
Overall, I had 10 days to spend with my entire family, which was a rare opportunity and a blessing, since it&#8217;s next to impossible to spend that much time together even at home, as everyone&#8217;s schedule is so different.		</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				2400 kms later, we completed a full circle: from Surrey to Seattle, resting at Coeur D&#8217;Arlene, Idaho, to Calgary, to Banff, resting at Golden, through Kelowna, and back to Surrey in 7 days.<br />
The title of this post should have been &#8220;EJ&#8217;s Trans-America Trip&#8221;, because we were intending to purchase and drive a family car from Vancouver back with stops through Seattle, Portland, Yellowstone National Park, Mount Rushmore, Chicago, but due to a change in plans, the car stayed, but we took it to &#8220;EJ&#8217;s Non-Trans-America Trip&#8221; anyway.<br />
In the 7 days, we encountered pretty much all four (3?) seasons: warm sunshine, rain and cloudy skies, and hail and snow. But, God answered my prayers, and for the days we were outside, the skies were clear, and we stayed dry! We were blessed to be able to borrow my dad&#8217;s bright yellow Matrix (a car I enjoy driving), so that we wouldn&#8217;t have to face hefty rental fees for cross border traveling. There was never a day that we didn&#8217;t spend time with a familiar face (apart from us two, of course), and we hit pretty much everything that was planned on our spreadsheet despite a tight schedule, sometimes with only a few minutes to spare:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Tulip Festival</strong><br />
<a title="IMG_0636 by b.p., on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aimeili/7144038113/"><img alt="IMG_0636" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7182/7144038113_a84b008232.jpg" width="400" height="277" /></a><br />
After less than a 10 minute wait at the Peach Arch border (which is unusual compared to the Truck Crossing), we made our way to Skagit for the tulips! The lady at the information center, told us about <strong>Lopez Island Creamery Ice Cream</strong>, which was well hidden at the back of a side-of-the-road &#8220;produce stand&#8221; at Snowgoose Produce. The gourmet prices for the <a href="http://lopezislandcreamery.com/#our-flavors" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">specialty flavours</a> (Country Raspberry for me, and Clearly Coconut for j.w) were well-worth it, and it was satisfying enough for our lunch without me having to stop at Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory for a frozen chocolate-nut dipped banana<br />
<img alt="" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-qnQKofGzbA4/T-PORbUiq8I/AAAAAAAAF9Y/tapU7f9__7g/s400/IMG-20120425-00033.jpg" width="400" height="267" /></li>
<li>We decided that we would skip Tuliptown (after visiting Roseengarde), so we had time to do a quick zip through Premium Outlets and didn&#8217;t come out empty handed, before heading to a previously booked <strong>Boeing Factory</strong> / Future of Flight Aviation Center tour in Everett, WA. The tour itself was pretty impressive &#8211; you could see people working on the assembly line, and the latest <a href="http://www.boeing.com/commercial/787family/787-8prod.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Boeing Dreamliner</a>. The factory was HUGE; I think they said that they could fit 70 something footballs fields or a couple of Disneyland theme parks in it. And at that size, they had their own personal medical and paramedical services, cafes, dry cleaners, and buses! The $18 fee was definitely worth it (though we cut it close and had maybe 5 minutes to spare by the time we got there)</li>
<li><strong>A Visit with Friends</strong><br />
Surprisingly, traffic from Everett to Bellevue wasn&#8217;t as bad as expected, so we arrived a bit earlier than expected, and just chilled in time for dinner with Virtualawrence, DTse, SH, and EHo at East West, a <a href="http://www.shermansfoodadventures.com/2011/08/facing-east-taiwanese.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Taiwanese restaurant</a> that Virtualawrence mentioned he&#8217;d bring me the next time we visited, which had some interesting dishes and flavours (like the pork burger and 3 cup chicken). with dessert at Yogurtland (though I&#8217;m still not convinced that self serve froyo is better in texture than Yogen Fruz) finished with a drive to Card Kingdom (a purposeful trip, just to find out that the online portion of the store closed for the day earlier that evening), and game or two of Dominion.</li>
<li><img alt="" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-TvRAzwf1s-I/T-POPpD1n2I/AAAAAAAAF9Q/pebtLuLA7oc/s400/IMG_0814.JPG" width="400" height="267" /><br />
After breakfast at a Parisian-style cafe with Virtualawrence (to which Fausbourg, Vancouver wins if compared), we headed out to Woodinville to spend the day with the Chens at their new place. The day passed quickly, but it was a fun time for everyone, even though we were all very sad to leave.<br />
<img alt="" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-7VXHNQPeX3I/T-PKwJn3f-I/AAAAAAAAF8w/Gcwf_N3G66M/s400/IMG-20120427-00037.jpg" width="400" height="300" /></li>
<li><strong>Snoqualmie</strong><br />
<a title="IMG_0854 by b.p., on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aimeili/7146796293/"><img alt="IMG_0854" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5276/7146796293_fc4b69259f.jpg" width="400" height="277" /></a><br />
After a good breakfast the next morning, we opted to spend more time before heading out, so we skipped Leavenworth, a town famous that&#8217;s decked out to be all German. Because of that, we took a different/shorter route, which allowed us to see Snoqualmie Falls and some old, abandoned trains. We also spotted a random helicopter along the I-90E that was carrying wood/logs.</li>
<li><strong>Iron Horses</strong><br />
<a title="IMG_0913 by b.p., on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aimeili/7146802867/"><img alt="IMG_0913" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8012/7146802867_190b70b5c2.jpg" width="400" height="277" /></a><br />
And because we skipped Leavenworth, we took the shorter route and were able to see the iron horses that Waiki told us about, off the I-90. We took a short climb and was rewarded with a lovely view from the top, despite a short bit of snow on the road early on.</li>
<li><strong>Coeur D&#8217;Arlene</strong><br />
<a title="IMG_0941 by b.p., on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aimeili/7146810907/"><img alt="IMG_0941" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7061/7146810907_bd197baaa7.jpg" width="400" height="277" /></a><br />
We finally made it to Coeur D&#8217;Arlene and enjoyed some wine and cheese at the bed &amp; breakfast pre-supper, and a great dinner meal by the host&#8217;s recommendation at a local restaurant called &#8220;<strong>Scratch</strong>&#8221; &#8211; where reportedly, everything is made from scratch on-site. Breakfast was scrumptious as well at McFarland Inn (our B&amp;B) &#8211; they even have their own custom coffee blend from a semi-local roaster</li>
<li><strong>Drive to Calgary</strong><br />
<a title="IMG_1036 by b.p., on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aimeili/7000743194/"><img alt="IMG_1036" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7136/7000743194_127f58e8d8.jpg" width="400" height="250" /></a><br />
Our host at the B&amp;B had told us to watch out for <strong>Frank&#8217;s Slide</strong> and the <strong>Okotoks</strong> along the way to Calgary. We had a beautiful drive: passed by a &#8220;Game crossing sign&#8221;  (immediate thought was board games), random cardboard cows on the top of a hill, two whitetail deers, a town by the name of <strong>Elmira</strong> and <strong>Yahk</strong>, BC  &#8211; the city that was made famous by the Red Paperclip quest, the<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terex_33-19_%22Titan%22" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> world&#8217;s largest truck</a> in <strong>Sparwood</strong>, BC (I didn&#8217;t realize it was once a running truck), and rocky mountain sheep roaming at Crowsnest Pass. The duty-free shop at the US-BC Border looked like a cabin, with sparse goods for sale inside. Unsurprisingly, we didn&#8217;t have to wait much at this border though I am sure the custom officer and the fellows at the duty-free shop wondered what we Asians were doing in that part of the country.</li>
<li><strong>With the Laus</strong><br />
Sunday was spent mostly in Calgary: attended a large, local church for Sunday service and had the opportunity to hear <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erwin_McManus" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Erwin McManus</a> speak, who shared with us some life stories. I don&#8217;t know why I recognize his name, but one lesson that stuck out was avoiding jargon, which is a principle that can be applied to business as well. Some trekkie comiccon was in town as well, but by the time we got there (before 11AM), all the tickets were sold out, so we ended up heading to Banff a bit earlier to explore.</li>
<li><strong>Banff</strong><br />
<a title="IMG_1082 by b.p., on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aimeili/7000750214/"><img alt="IMG_1082" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7059/7000750214_9e77fc9f7d.jpg" width="400" height="250" /></a><br />
This time we stayed at <strong>Banff Aspen Lodge</strong>, at the beginning of the main strip. It looks like a motel on the outside, but you can tell that they spent some money to do some rework to make the rooms nice and modern (and clean) &#8211; the rates were lower than some of the lodging around them, and it even included continental breakfast, with homemade granola.<img alt="" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-0wQdbL7FCi4/T-POMk78uCI/AAAAAAAAF9A/klqitQVcIpE/s400/IMG-20120430-00077.jpg" width="400" height="300" /><br />
Two of the local coffee shops that I would recommend in Banff is <strong>Evelyn&#8217;s</strong> and <strong>Wild Flour</strong> (also mentioned in Where to Eat in Canada), though I think I might like the environment of the latter a little bit more. We also found handmade natural soap at a place called Rocky Mountain Soap &#8211; the lady was very generous in that she even gave us some samples (on the second day, we went back, but the lady wasn&#8217;t there and this other lady didn&#8217;t seem as inviting)!<br />
It&#8217;s interesting to be in Banff, Lake Louise, and Johnston Canyon at this time of the year; snow still lingers on the trails, the lake, and the normally shimmery, reflective turquoise of Lake Louise is covered with white and ice instead. Lake Louise felt the most like winter than spring.<br />
<a title="IMG_1147 by b.p., on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aimeili/7146846127/"><img alt="IMG_1147" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7279/7146846127_86be2e7484.jpg" width="400" height="277" /></a></li>
<li><strong>River to Peaks</strong><br />
<a title="IMG_1199 by b.p., on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aimeili/7000775506/"><img alt="IMG_1199" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5034/7000775506_b99a69c259.jpg" width="400" height="277" /></a><br />
After dinner with the Laus at a burger joint, we went our separate ways, with us headed to Golden, BC to rest our heads. The story of how we even found this accomodation still puzzles me to this day, to which I can only attribute to God&#8217;s provision! I can only surmise that I had sent out an inquiry to a chalet that offered longer-term accomodations, and they had directed us to <a href="http://www.rivertopeaks.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">River to Peaks Inn</a>. Turns out, even though we had booked a King suite, we had the whole place to ourselves (likely because it was still low season, and a relatively new place as an Inn), and our host, Dan was great to deal with and told us a little about how the Inn came to be (was once resort staff residence; he lives next door &#8211; the Inn is in residential area and it looks like a converted duplex) and the simple continental breakfast made the stay seem like an even better deal. Actually, we felt that this was the most comfortable bed in terms of paid accomodations on our trip (did I detect Sheraton hotel bed sheets?). I felt a bit sad that we didn&#8217;t have time to explore Golden, or walk around, because the scenery was just so relaxing, with the view of the mountain and the fresh air around you. And yes, this region is where Kicking Horse coffee comes from!</li>
<li><strong>Sicamous, BC</strong><br />
<a title="IMG_1253 by b.p., on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aimeili/7146874551/"><img alt="IMG_1253" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5348/7146874551_df3775b68d.jpg" width="400" height="277" /></a><br />
We were homeward bound the next morning, but with our first stop in <strong>Sicamous, BC at D. Dutchmen Diary</strong> for <span class="spell">purportedly</span> BC&#8217;s best ice cream (for breakfast?). Maybe I was comparing it to Lopez Island Creamery, but I found this ice cream to be too creamy and pretty standard; I had a good time looking at the llamas and the cows though, though one tried to lick my ice cream! j.w spotted a white and brown speckled eagle along the way as well. Though, in our notes, he also wrote, &#8220;falcon carrying a nest, almost hit [our] car&#8221;<br />
<a title="IMG_1210 by b.p., on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aimeili/7000782466/"><img alt="IMG_1210" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8146/7000782466_45d55697ee.jpg" width="400" height="277" /></a></li>
<li><strong>Kelowna, BC</strong><br />
<a title="IMG_1300 by b.p., on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aimeili/7146945763/"><img alt="IMG_1300" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7268/7146945763_282b4afea6.jpg" width="400" height="277" /></a><br />
And a slight detour to winery country, which brought back memories of my childhood, although we didn&#8217;t see the Ogopogo and only saw what was once the floating bridge in the distance. Instead, we spent time at the <strong>Summerhill Pyramid Winery</strong> for some bubbly wine, and needed time to &#8220;burn&#8221; it off, so we stayed a bit later to share a very lovely three-beet risotto, where the ingredients are sourced organically and locally. This winery is a bit mystical/New Age as it uses a pyramid to age the wine (and all organic), but the acoustics in that thing is pretty crazy. Again, we only had minutes to spare before the winery tour began, but we were not at all impressed at how our tour started: this fellow comes out and starts speaking in Mandarin to two other guys. J.w notices and thinks that he might be the tour guide??? Anyway, he leads them back into the shop, at which point we follow, but then try to flag down someone to explain that we don&#8217;t speak Mandarin (and why would people assume that we do just because we look Chinese?!). And Kelowna of all places? Nevertheless, we refused to follow him, and thankfully, another employee took us for a private tour.</li>
<li><strong>airport Pie</strong><br />
And this was it, the final leg of our trip. One last stop at Chilliwack&#8217;s Airport for some pie. Yes, it&#8217;s weird that airport food would be well-known, and that people go to this tiny, local.small planes airport just to eat. And their pies are popular; in fact, if you go the day of, there is a limit of how many slices of one kind of pie you can buy. If you order in advance, you get a discount too (which we didn&#8217;t know about!)</li>
<li><strong>TWU</strong><br />
okay, so we also stopped at TWU after passing by a flipped tractor trailer on its side &#8211; thankfully we didn&#8217;t need to take that exit to pick up my dad from work, since he was without a car (in our possession). And, we drove home, right in time for dinner at that place with the giant, sweet slushes..can&#8217;t remember the name right now&#8230;was kind of disappointed in the quality; I think I would have preferred the Taiwanese food at Surrey Central more.</li>
<li><strong>Home Sweet Home</strong><br />
then we flew home the very next day. <strong>The end</strong></li>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Well, since I have been posting about our last few various trips, I might as well catch up before falling behind again.</p>
<p>This past Canadian Thanksgiving weekend, we decided for some American history. Two of us girls decided to take the overnight Metrobus from Toronto to Washington, DC. For me, it was my first time in DC, so I relied on D to know the highlights of the area. She had researched the museums and memorial ahead of time and compiled a list of museums that we should visit.</p>
<p><a title="IMG_9347 by b.p., on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aimeili/6236418731/"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6031/6236418731_01362a9f33.jpg" alt="IMG_9347" width="400" height="266" /></a>&#65279;</p>
<p>I looked forward to a couple of museums, specifically the Lego exhibition at the National Building Archives Museum and the Air and Space Museum at the Smithsonian. While the first had a nominal fee for students, all the Smithsonian museums are free! However, I was a little bit disappointed: the Air and Space Museum, while good (especially for zero cost), wasn&#8217;t as interesting as the ones in Ottawa and New York City, but it could be because I was expecting to see some modern American fighter and stealth planes, but I guess most of them were elsewhere. Sadly, the astro-cosmo viewing wasn&#8217;t open at the hours we visited so we missed out on that, and the planetarium (fee applies) was showing the same evolutionary film narrated by Robert Redford that I had already seen in August at the California Academy of Sciences in San Francisco. The Lego exhibit was also a little smaller than expected, with models that focus on buildings and projects that had architectural character, although famous buildings like the Eiffel Tower were not displayed. We also stopped by the butterfly garden, which had little butterflies, and the Museum of Natural History, but I enjoyed the Harvard Museum of National History, MA instead. We also visited the National Zoo, which while quiet, had some interesting exhibits (like the towers for the orangutans to cross).</p>
<p><a title="IMG_9182 by b.p., on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aimeili/6236402627/"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6173/6236402627_3d5985dd6d.jpg" alt="IMG_9182" width="400" height="266" /></a>&#65279;</p>
<p>We didn&#8217;t actually have time to see any of the memorials and we took few pictures of the landmarks (Capitol Hill, Washington Monument), but we came across some pleasant surprises:</p>
<ul>
<li>God&#8217;s protection and His timing: for whatever reason, upon disbarking the bus, we were approached by some driver on the street selling his services, but we were skeptical so we flagged down a cab. However, within a few seconds, we discovered that he didn&#8217;t know where to go to get to our destination, so we got out before the meter started ticking. The sketchy driver came back to solicit his driving services; we were reluctant so we headed back to the bus area&#8230;when, I realized that I was missing my SLR camera, lenses, my wallet = significance. I initially thought my passport was in there too, but I later realized I had moved it elsewhere. Long story short, we talked to the bus employees and they managed to retrieve it from the bus at the depot and drive it back. Not only that, they told us that the subway was only two blocks away, so we ended up taking the more economical route (saving us probably a good $15). If we had not encountered the strange drivers, I may had not retrieve my belongings at all (since these buses tend to continue their scheduled route). Lesson one: people don&#8217;t mind being blunt &#8211; I was quite unaccostumed to hearing their constant asking for &#8220;reward&#8221; money, but they deserved it for their extra effort and safe return of all my belongings.</li>
<li>We had no trouble with our accomodations, my first booking with <a href="http://www.airbnb.com/users/show/1191691" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Airbnb.com</a> &#8211; it went smoothly and I felt pretty safe in the building/neighbourhood.</li>
<li>Walked through a garden of some modern art pieces &#8211; it was quite interesting to see modern man-made pieces into a natural setting</li>
<li>Mount Vernon, George Washington&#8217;s estate contained a little bit more of the American history that I was looking for &#8211; it contained the house the Washingtons stayed at, and told about George Washington&#8217;s personal life, like his wooden dentures, and how he died (caught a cold/infection) with him knowing he was close to his end (had his wife execute one of two wills).
<p><a title="IMG_9480 by b.p., on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aimeili/6236425651/"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6212/6236425651_6fa990c7d4.jpg" alt="IMG_9480" width="400" height="266" /></a>&#65279;</li>
<li>And of course, the food&#8230;</li>
</ul>
<p>On to the food! So with D researching the museums, I was tasked with finding other things to do, like places to eat. And eat we did &#8211; with D willing to accompany me on our food treks. Our first (and last!) stop was at the Eastern Market/the Hill for some AMAZING crab cakes at Market Lunch. I tend not to like crab cakes because they&#8217;re usually a salty, deep-fried wad of processed seafood meat. But you could actually see the pieces of crab in these crab cakes. Actually, we were so impressed at the food and the 1/2 tea 1/2 lemonade, that we ordered an oyster sandwich too. We also couldn&#8217;t help but smile at Tommy&#8217;s service. D was a great food companion, as we were able to share almost everything, and still be satisfied.</p>
<p><a title="IMG_9163 by b.p., on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aimeili/6236923724/"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6224/6236923724_685d4f8307.jpg" alt="IMG_9163" width="400" height="266" /></a>&#65279;</p>
<p>To finish, we shared a gelato for dessert. While a bit on the pricier side, the selection was more unique, with flavours like a qunince, and rhubarb. I ended up settling for passionfruit, while D had some milk tea gelato (yes, that tasted like real milk tea). Later that day, we tried a self-serve froyo place, where it was no more than 69 cents an ounce, with free hot fudge. I discovered that froyo tastes best with the original tart taste, and that if you quickly pull down and release the lever, you&#8217;ll just get mush. And of course, we piled on the hot fudge.</p>
<p><a title="IMG_9310 by b.p., on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aimeili/6236936694/"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6221/6236936694_24da905e8e.jpg" alt="IMG_9310" width="400" height="266" /></a></p>
<p>Our host&#8217;s neighbour also drew us a map of the neighbourhood and placed some recommendations on it. One was a miss at Chix but I can see the potential draw (they missed giving us the sauce so the chicken was a little dry), but the other was nice happy hour appetizers (and wine) at a local wine bistro (Vinotecca). And here is lesson two: Washington folks dress well. I don&#8217;t remember feeling so underdressed in a city before.</p>
<p>With our luck (what luck, when God watches over us?), we stumbled across the city&#8217;s food festival, with many vendors along a few blocks selling a sample of their specialty items like fish tacos, (lobster?) mac&amp;cheese with candied bacon, and waffle sandwiches (with a line up that felt like a mile long so we skipped that one). Admission was $15 for 10(?) tickets, enough for us to share our samples with each other.</p>
<p><a title="IMG_9385 by b.p., on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aimeili/6236419857/"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6225/6236419857_458fef368f.jpg" alt="IMG_9385" width="400" height="266" /></a></p>
<p>I was also blessed to be able to eat some homemade Malaysian food, and meet some of D&#8217;s extended family, and her extended family&#8217;s friends. We ended back at the Hill to shop at the street market and in hopes that the Market Lunch was still open. If it wasn&#8217;t closed, we would have missed stumbling upon the pizza joint, 7th Hill. We ordered and sat at the bar, watching the pizza creator put the fresh ingredients into the pizza, tossing it in the air, and placing it into the stone oven. The pizza reminded me of the ones we had eaten in Italy, with thin crust, little tomato sauce, and good ingredients.</p>
<p>We ended our trip at Pounds, local coffee shop at the Hill, with D having a nutella latte with latte art, and I with their smooth house blend top secret iced coffee (they sell beans, but not for their iced coffee) &#8211; another accidental find!</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Lesson three:</span>Maybe it&#8217;s more of an observation than a lesson: based on my time in San Francisco and DC, it seems like people are more open about their sexual orientation in these two cities than all of Canada combined, where it&#8217;s openly blessed and practiced.</p>
