								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				<![CDATA[When we go on family vacations, I often end up finding myself being our family's "travel agent", so here's a handy list of what I consult when doing travel research or trying to get the best travel deal for my future reference, and for yours, if you end up being your family's travel guy/guide:


<h2>In general</h2>


These are two places I check first for flights and accommodations:


<ul>
    

<li>Google Flights &#8211; use them to get a sense of what the prices are, and where you might be able to find the lowest price if you&#8217;re more flexible with dates
[caption id="attachment_5515" align="alignnone" width="294"]<a href="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/flights.png"><img class="wp-image-5515 size-medium" src="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/flights-294x300.png" alt="Google Flights Flexible Date Chart to find the best price" width="294" height="300" srcset="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/flights-294x300.png 294w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/flights.png 699w" sizes="(max-width: 294px) 100vw, 294px" /></a> To find the price graph or chart, you need to click on the calendar icon in either date field.[/caption]</li>


    

<li>AirBnb</li>


</ul>


If you&#8217;re flexible on time and destination, you can find some pretty great flight deals on <a href="http://forums.redflagdeals.com/hot-deals-f9/?c=5159" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RedFlagDeals</a> or&nbsp;<a href="http://www.yyzdeals.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YYZ Deals</a>&nbsp;/ <a href="http://www.yvrdeals.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YVR Deals</a> (or other Canadian destinations via the parent company,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ydeals.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YDeals</a>)
For ideas of what to do or eat, I like to sign out books from the library or borrow e-books from the library and jot down common suggestions or interesting ideas and go from there.


<h2>Within Canada</h2>




<h3>Flights</h3>




<ul>
    

<li>Pick smaller airports if they&#8217;re similar in distance to your destination and price (e.g. Abbotsford over Vancouver, Kitchener-Waterloo vs. Toronto) as you&#8217;ll likely find cheaper parking, shorter check-in and security lines, and friendlier people</li>


    

<li>Cheaper seats tend to occur between Tuesday and Thursday</li>


    

<li>Check for the prices of flights&nbsp;operated by smaller brands like <a href="http://gonewleaf.ca" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NewLeaf </a>or <a href="http://flyporter.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Porter</a>, and even the sub-brands of major carriers like&nbsp;Air Canada Rouge or Air Canada Jazz. There are charters too like Air Transat or Sunwing, but I generally avoid them due to size and luggage restrictions.</li>


</ul>




<h3>Car Rentals</h3>




<ul>
    

<li>Costco Travel Canada, for Costco members; free second driver if spouse is also a Costco member</li>


    

<li>Priceline &#8211; I haven&#8217;t used them, but my parents have been able to rent a car near the Toronto airport for $10 a day by bidding on a car rental once upon a time.</li>


</ul>




<h3>Accommodations</h3>




<ul>
    

<li>I find there are less listings in Canada on Airbnb.com (likely because it started in SF, CA, so you might find more choices out West vs East), but one good alternative are bed &amp; breakfasts on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bbcanada.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bbcanada.com</a></li>


    

<li>If you&#8217;re travelling to a university town, you can always check their conference center or student residences if it&#8217;s during a quiet time of the year (e.g. summer) for private suites, student apartments, etc.</li>


</ul>




<h2>Canada to/from US</h2>




<h3>Flights</h3>




<ul>
    

<li>Fly from a US city instead of Canada, if it&#8217;s within driving distance; one night&#8217;s sleep and fly package at a hotel (where parking is included when you&#8217;re away) is cheaper than cost of difference in flight</li>


    

<li>Compared to Canada, there seems to be more&nbsp;competition and options in the US:&nbsp;while there are major US-international airlines&nbsp;(United, American Airlines, Delta), we actually prefer the service and price of domestic-only&nbsp;carriers like JetBlue or Southwest; we have not flown ultra-budget airline, Spirit yet, but seat-sale prices are good, even with the price of one checked baggage ($21 per person).</li>


    

<li>Honorable/historic mention: Hipmunk.com, once a SF startup, which provides a more comprehensive view of travel duration, prices on&nbsp;discount sites like Expedia, Travelocity, etc., but to be honest,&nbsp;I don&#8217;t consult it as much&nbsp;anymore now that Google Flight is an option.</li>


</ul>




<h3>Accommodations</h3>




<ul>
    

<li><a href="http://www.airbnb.ca/c/ewong61" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Airbnb</a>&nbsp;(referral link &#8211; $40CAD for first booking)</li>


    

<li>Priceline &#8211; many people have booked via priceline, but if you&#8217;re travelling with more than 2, please note that the fine print says that the price is for two, so I&#8217;m not sure how it works if you plan to travel with more (do you pay the difference? I haven&#8217;t ever tried)</li>


    

<li><a href="https://www.vrbo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VRBO</a> and <a href="https://www.homeaway.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HomeAway</a>&nbsp;&#8211; so I&#8217;m still not clear about&nbsp;the difference between these two sites as they belong to the same company,&nbsp;and they seem to operate similarly to AirBnB but it seems less organized. My sister has booked with them before, for our places in Hawaii.</li>


</ul>




<h3>Car rental</h3>


<a href="https://www.autoslash.com/blog-and-tips/posts/all-about-additional-driver-fees" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Note that certain states cover a second driver for free</a>, and some car rental companies will have free second drivers if they&#8217;re your spouse or if you are a member, for example.


<ul>
    

<li>Costco Travel may have different prices on the US site vs. the Canadian site &#8211; and you need to have separate logins as well; free second driver if spouse is also a Costco member</li>


    

<li><a href="http://autoslash.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Autoslash</a>: we came across this site from Parents magazine &#8211; if you can&#8217;t find a good deal on their site, if you book via another site (like Costco) and send them the confirmation number, it will look for cheaper options until your trip starts. If you end up booking through them, they will automatically cancel and book the same reservation for you if the price drops before your rental starts! I couldn&#8217;t figure out&nbsp;their revenue model so it seemed too good to be true at first, but it worked out great. We found out the hard way that some companies don&#8217;t include fees in the car rental quotes, but this site breaks everything down for you so it&#8217;s WYSIWYG (or pay in this case). You don&#8217;t actually pay until you get to the car rental counter! If you are looking for a specific service, eg. a shuttle to/from the cruise port, you might need to enter a specific location code, which can be found in the car rental fine print when you search for an itinerary OR you can email them to ask which location offers it (they do seem to know!)</li>


</ul>


So, that&#8217;s what we have used in the past&nbsp;&#8211; if you have any links to add to the list / share, please leave a comment!]]&gt;		</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				<![CDATA[2400 kms later, we completed a full circle: from Surrey to Seattle, resting at Coeur D'Arlene, Idaho, to Calgary, to Banff, resting at Golden, through Kelowna, and back to Surrey in 7 days.
The title of this post should have been "EJ's Trans-America Trip", because we were intending to purchase and drive a family car from Vancouver back with stops through Seattle, Portland, Yellowstone National Park, Mount Rushmore, Chicago, but due to a change in plans, the car stayed, but we took it to "EJ's Non-Trans-America Trip" anyway.
In the 7 days, we encountered pretty much all four (3?) seasons: warm sunshine, rain and cloudy skies, and hail and snow. But, God answered my prayers, and for the days we were outside, the skies were clear, and we stayed dry! We were blessed to be able to borrow my dad's bright yellow Matrix (a car I enjoy driving), so that we wouldn't have to face hefty rental fees for cross border traveling. There was never a day that we didn't spend time with a familiar face (apart from us two, of course), and we hit pretty much everything that was planned on our spreadsheet despite a tight schedule, sometimes with only a few minutes to spare:


<ol>
    

<li><strong>Tulip Festival</strong>
<a title="IMG_0636 by b.p., on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aimeili/7144038113/"><img alt="IMG_0636" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7182/7144038113_a84b008232.jpg" width="400" height="277" /></a>
After less than a 10 minute wait at the Peach Arch border (which is unusual compared to the Truck Crossing), we made our way to Skagit for the tulips! The lady at the information center, told us about <strong>Lopez Island Creamery Ice Cream</strong>, which was well hidden at the back of a side-of-the-road &#8220;produce stand&#8221; at Snowgoose Produce. The gourmet prices for the <a href="http://lopezislandcreamery.com/#our-flavors" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">specialty flavours</a> (Country Raspberry for me, and Clearly Coconut for j.w) were well-worth it, and it was satisfying enough for our lunch without me having to stop at Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory for a frozen chocolate-nut dipped banana
<img alt="" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-qnQKofGzbA4/T-PORbUiq8I/AAAAAAAAF9Y/tapU7f9__7g/s400/IMG-20120425-00033.jpg" width="400" height="267" /></li>


    

<li>We decided that we would skip Tuliptown (after visiting Roseengarde), so we had time to do a quick zip through Premium Outlets and didn&#8217;t come out empty handed, before heading to a previously booked <strong>Boeing Factory</strong> / Future of Flight Aviation Center tour in Everett, WA. The tour itself was pretty impressive &#8211; you could see people working on the assembly line, and the latest <a href="http://www.boeing.com/commercial/787family/787-8prod.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Boeing Dreamliner</a>. The factory was HUGE; I think they said that they could fit 70 something footballs fields or a couple of Disneyland theme parks in it. And at that size, they had their own personal medical and paramedical services, cafes, dry cleaners, and buses! The $18 fee was definitely worth it (though we cut it close and had maybe 5 minutes to spare by the time we got there)</li>


    

<li><strong>A Visit with Friends</strong>
Surprisingly, traffic from Everett to Bellevue wasn&#8217;t as bad as expected, so we arrived a bit earlier than expected, and just chilled in time for dinner with Virtualawrence, DTse, SH, and EHo at East West, a <a href="http://www.shermansfoodadventures.com/2011/08/facing-east-taiwanese.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Taiwanese restaurant</a> that Virtualawrence mentioned he&#8217;d bring me the next time we visited, which had some interesting dishes and flavours (like the pork burger and 3 cup chicken). with dessert at Yogurtland (though I&#8217;m still not convinced that self serve froyo is better in texture than Yogen Fruz) finished with a drive to Card Kingdom (a purposeful trip, just to find out that the online portion of the store closed for the day earlier that evening), and game or two of Dominion.</li>


    

<li><img alt="" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-TvRAzwf1s-I/T-POPpD1n2I/AAAAAAAAF9Q/pebtLuLA7oc/s400/IMG_0814.JPG" width="400" height="267" />
After breakfast at a Parisian-style cafe with Virtualawrence (to which Fausbourg, Vancouver wins if compared), we headed out to Woodinville to spend the day with the Chens at their new place. The day passed quickly, but it was a fun time for everyone, even though we were all very sad to leave.
<img alt="" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-7VXHNQPeX3I/T-PKwJn3f-I/AAAAAAAAF8w/Gcwf_N3G66M/s400/IMG-20120427-00037.jpg" width="400" height="300" /></li>


    

<li><strong>Snoqualmie</strong>
<a title="IMG_0854 by b.p., on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aimeili/7146796293/"><img alt="IMG_0854" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5276/7146796293_fc4b69259f.jpg" width="400" height="277" /></a>
After a good breakfast the next morning, we opted to spend more time before heading out, so we skipped Leavenworth, a town famous that&#8217;s decked out to be all German. Because of that, we took a different/shorter route, which allowed us to see Snoqualmie Falls and some old, abandoned trains. We also spotted a random helicopter along the I-90E that was carrying wood/logs.</li>


    

<li><strong>Iron Horses</strong>
<a title="IMG_0913 by b.p., on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aimeili/7146802867/"><img alt="IMG_0913" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8012/7146802867_190b70b5c2.jpg" width="400" height="277" /></a>
And because we skipped Leavenworth, we took the shorter route and were able to see the iron horses that Waiki told us about, off the I-90. We took a short climb and was rewarded with a lovely view from the top, despite a short bit of snow on the road early on.</li>


    

<li><strong>Coeur D&#8217;Arlene</strong>
<a title="IMG_0941 by b.p., on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aimeili/7146810907/"><img alt="IMG_0941" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7061/7146810907_bd197baaa7.jpg" width="400" height="277" /></a>
We finally made it to Coeur D&#8217;Arlene and enjoyed some wine and cheese at the bed &amp; breakfast pre-supper, and a great dinner meal by the host&#8217;s recommendation at a local restaurant called &#8220;<strong>Scratch</strong>&#8221; &#8211; where reportedly, everything is made from scratch on-site. Breakfast was scrumptious as well at McFarland Inn (our B&amp;B) &#8211; they even have their own custom coffee blend from a semi-local roaster</li>


    

<li><strong>Drive to Calgary</strong>
<a title="IMG_1036 by b.p., on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aimeili/7000743194/"><img alt="IMG_1036" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7136/7000743194_127f58e8d8.jpg" width="400" height="250" /></a>
Our host at the B&amp;B had told us to watch out for <strong>Frank&#8217;s Slide</strong> and the <strong>Okotoks</strong> along the way to Calgary. We had a beautiful drive: passed by a &#8220;Game crossing sign&#8221;  (immediate thought was board games), random cardboard cows on the top of a hill, two whitetail deers, a town by the name of <strong>Elmira</strong> and <strong>Yahk</strong>, BC  &#8211; the city that was made famous by the Red Paperclip quest, the<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terex_33-19_%22Titan%22" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> world&#8217;s largest truck</a> in <strong>Sparwood</strong>, BC (I didn&#8217;t realize it was once a running truck), and rocky mountain sheep roaming at Crowsnest Pass. The duty-free shop at the US-BC Border looked like a cabin, with sparse goods for sale inside. Unsurprisingly, we didn&#8217;t have to wait much at this border though I am sure the custom officer and the fellows at the duty-free shop wondered what we Asians were doing in that part of the country.</li>


    

<li><strong>With the Laus</strong>
Sunday was spent mostly in Calgary: attended a large, local church for Sunday service and had the opportunity to hear <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erwin_McManus" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Erwin McManus</a> speak, who shared with us some life stories. I don&#8217;t know why I recognize his name, but one lesson that stuck out was avoiding jargon, which is a principle that can be applied to business as well. Some trekkie comiccon was in town as well, but by the time we got there (before 11AM), all the tickets were sold out, so we ended up heading to Banff a bit earlier to explore.</li>


    

<li><strong>Banff</strong>
<a title="IMG_1082 by b.p., on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aimeili/7000750214/"><img alt="IMG_1082" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7059/7000750214_9e77fc9f7d.jpg" width="400" height="250" /></a>
This time we stayed at <strong>Banff Aspen Lodge</strong>, at the beginning of the main strip. It looks like a motel on the outside, but you can tell that they spent some money to do some rework to make the rooms nice and modern (and clean) &#8211; the rates were lower than some of the lodging around them, and it even included continental breakfast, with homemade granola.<img alt="" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-0wQdbL7FCi4/T-POMk78uCI/AAAAAAAAF9A/klqitQVcIpE/s400/IMG-20120430-00077.jpg" width="400" height="300" />
Two of the local coffee shops that I would recommend in Banff is <strong>Evelyn&#8217;s</strong> and <strong>Wild Flour</strong> (also mentioned in Where to Eat in Canada), though I think I might like the environment of the latter a little bit more. We also found handmade natural soap at a place called Rocky Mountain Soap &#8211; the lady was very generous in that she even gave us some samples (on the second day, we went back, but the lady wasn&#8217;t there and this other lady didn&#8217;t seem as inviting)!
It&#8217;s interesting to be in Banff, Lake Louise, and Johnston Canyon at this time of the year; snow still lingers on the trails, the lake, and the normally shimmery, reflective turquoise of Lake Louise is covered with white and ice instead. Lake Louise felt the most like winter than spring.
<a title="IMG_1147 by b.p., on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aimeili/7146846127/"><img alt="IMG_1147" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7279/7146846127_86be2e7484.jpg" width="400" height="277" /></a></li>


    

<li><strong>River to Peaks</strong>
<a title="IMG_1199 by b.p., on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aimeili/7000775506/"><img alt="IMG_1199" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5034/7000775506_b99a69c259.jpg" width="400" height="277" /></a>
After dinner with the Laus at a burger joint, we went our separate ways, with us headed to Golden, BC to rest our heads. The story of how we even found this accomodation still puzzles me to this day, to which I can only attribute to God&#8217;s provision! I can only surmise that I had sent out an inquiry to a chalet that offered longer-term accomodations, and they had directed us to <a href="http://www.rivertopeaks.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">River to Peaks Inn</a>. Turns out, even though we had booked a King suite, we had the whole place to ourselves (likely because it was still low season, and a relatively new place as an Inn), and our host, Dan was great to deal with and told us a little about how the Inn came to be (was once resort staff residence; he lives next door &#8211; the Inn is in residential area and it looks like a converted duplex) and the simple continental breakfast made the stay seem like an even better deal. Actually, we felt that this was the most comfortable bed in terms of paid accomodations on our trip (did I detect Sheraton hotel bed sheets?). I felt a bit sad that we didn&#8217;t have time to explore Golden, or walk around, because the scenery was just so relaxing, with the view of the mountain and the fresh air around you. And yes, this region is where Kicking Horse coffee comes from!</li>


    

<li><strong>Sicamous, BC</strong>
<a title="IMG_1253 by b.p., on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aimeili/7146874551/"><img alt="IMG_1253" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5348/7146874551_df3775b68d.jpg" width="400" height="277" /></a>
We were homeward bound the next morning, but with our first stop in <strong>Sicamous, BC at D. Dutchmen Diary</strong> for <span class="spell">purportedly</span> BC&#8217;s best ice cream (for breakfast?). Maybe I was comparing it to Lopez Island Creamery, but I found this ice cream to be too creamy and pretty standard; I had a good time looking at the llamas and the cows though, though one tried to lick my ice cream! j.w spotted a white and brown speckled eagle along the way as well. Though, in our notes, he also wrote, &#8220;falcon carrying a nest, almost hit [our] car&#8221;
<a title="IMG_1210 by b.p., on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aimeili/7000782466/"><img alt="IMG_1210" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8146/7000782466_45d55697ee.jpg" width="400" height="277" /></a></li>


    

<li><strong>Kelowna, BC</strong>
<a title="IMG_1300 by b.p., on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aimeili/7146945763/"><img alt="IMG_1300" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7268/7146945763_282b4afea6.jpg" width="400" height="277" /></a>
And a slight detour to winery country, which brought back memories of my childhood, although we didn&#8217;t see the Ogopogo and only saw what was once the floating bridge in the distance. Instead, we spent time at the <strong>Summerhill Pyramid Winery</strong> for some bubbly wine, and needed time to &#8220;burn&#8221; it off, so we stayed a bit later to share a very lovely three-beet risotto, where the ingredients are sourced organically and locally. This winery is a bit mystical/New Age as it uses a pyramid to age the wine (and all organic), but the acoustics in that thing is pretty crazy. Again, we only had minutes to spare before the winery tour began, but we were not at all impressed at how our tour started: this fellow comes out and starts speaking in Mandarin to two other guys. J.w notices and thinks that he might be the tour guide??? Anyway, he leads them back into the shop, at which point we follow, but then try to flag down someone to explain that we don&#8217;t speak Mandarin (and why would people assume that we do just because we look Chinese?!). And Kelowna of all places? Nevertheless, we refused to follow him, and thankfully, another employee took us for a private tour.</li>


    

<li><strong>airport Pie</strong>
And this was it, the final leg of our trip. One last stop at Chilliwack&#8217;s Airport for some pie. Yes, it&#8217;s weird that airport food would be well-known, and that people go to this tiny, local.small planes airport just to eat. And their pies are popular; in fact, if you go the day of, there is a limit of how many slices of one kind of pie you can buy. If you order in advance, you get a discount too (which we didn&#8217;t know about!)</li>


    

<li><strong>TWU</strong>
okay, so we also stopped at TWU after passing by a flipped tractor trailer on its side &#8211; thankfully we didn&#8217;t need to take that exit to pick up my dad from work, since he was without a car (in our possession). And, we drove home, right in time for dinner at that place with the giant, sweet slushes..can&#8217;t remember the name right now&#8230;was kind of disappointed in the quality; I think I would have preferred the Taiwanese food at Surrey Central more.</li>


    

<li><strong>Home Sweet Home</strong>
then we flew home the very next day. <strong>The end</strong></li>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				<![CDATA[

<p>Recently, we took a two week vacation from our regular routine. The few weeks leading to it crescendoed into a flurry of activities: wrapping up current work, ensuring that everything would go smoothly for KJ&#8217;s wedding, planning the trip and finding accomodations, and packing. And, what would a true wedding be without a few hiccups and last minute scrambles? It certainly made for a memorable one: many firsts, such as seeing a bride ask the officiating pastor if her and her groom could kiss now, and returning from the recession to sign the registry (oops). I was still able to squeeze in some meaningful conversations, connect with some familiar faces again at the wedding, and hearing sad news from the BAC family (prayers needed!).</p>




<p><a title="IMG_0198 by b.p., on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aimeili/7104986655/"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8001/7104986655_b57749788d.jpg" alt="IMG_0198" width="400" height="266" /></a></p>




<p>While Fall would be my favourite time of the year in Ontario (because of the beautiful colours of the changing leaves), Spring is the perfect time of the year to visit Vancouver / the West Coast; daffodils and tulips are blooming, and the trees are blossoming everywhere! I took j.w to my two favourite spots when it&#8217;s this time of the year: Burnaby Mountain and Queen Elizabeth Park.</p>




<p><a title="IMG_0558 by b.p., on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aimeili/7155640860/"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7099/7155640860_10376ae0b6_n.jpg" alt="IMG_0558" width="200" height="300" /></a> <a title="IMG_0479 by b.p., on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aimeili/7155636712/"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7105/7155636712_18f1312120_n.jpg" alt="IMG_0479" width="200" height="300" /></a></p>




<p>And what is a trip to Vancouver without some good food? Tunger and Mich, the go-to couple for food, hehe. And of course, to get j.w&#8217;s sushi fix! Our menu for the week consisted of the following:</p>




<ol>


<li><strong>Wednesday</strong><br />Late meal: some random restaurant to eat as I was hungry from the flight. It was a first from what I remember: perserved duck egg with lean pork congee, but with dried oysters, and it was good.&nbsp;</li>




<li><strong>Thursday</strong><br /><span style="color: #993300;">Lunch</span>: my mom took me to a (newish) Taiwanese restaurant that is conveniently close to home. Turns out, she was right about bumping into my uncle there; he often goes for lunch but which is no wonder, as their portion sizes are huge = great value! (and pretty good too). Had a McD&#8217;s snack size $2 smoothie for dessert (took advantage of their promotion).<br /><span style="color: #993300;">Dinne</span>r: a very fulfilling (and cleansing) wedding rehearsal dinner at Dai Tong (<span id="result_box" class="short_text" lang="zh-TW"><span>&#22823;&#21516;</span></span>&#65279;). We had a very lovely purple yam soup dessert that looked like dimetapp but tasted like the gingery <span lang="zh-Hant">&#28271;&#22291;</span>&#65279; soup &#8211; another first for me!</li>




<li><strong>Friday</strong><br /><span style="color: #993300;">Lunch</span>: Mich and Tunger told me about Hi Genki, a Japanese restaurant that serves home-style cooked dishes in a Japanese retirement home / cultural centre in Burnaby. Since my mom doesn&#8217;t like raw fish, I suggested that we should try their dishes. However, I feel that you need to know what to order, as the dishes can be a hit or miss (one hit was a herbal broth like fish stew).<br /><span style="color: #993300;">Dinner</span>: My brother recommended Bamboo Grove, a Chinese restaurant that&#8217;s not for the budget-friendly folks. In fact, they don&#8217;t even list prices on some of their menu items, like the <span>Pork Stomach and Gingko Long Boiled Soup&#8221; &#32769;&#28779; &#35948; &#32922; &#28271;</span>&#65279; (btw, the small is HUGE &#8211; more than enough to feed 4 of us). Okay, that doesn&#8217;t sound very appealing, and it might taste pretty foul if some restaurants don&#8217;t do a proper job of cleaning, quite offal, but there wasn&#8217;t nothing off about this one. Actually, I was surprised to find that it was similar to some of the soups that my father-in-law makes!</li>




<li><strong>Saturday<br /></strong><span style="color: #993300;">Lunch</span>: I didn&#8217;t really eat a lunch that day, but the Tai family generously fed me some of their delicious crispy pork (whole piglet) that the groom&#8217;s family had delivered first thing in the morning. Then, Mich took us to Fausborg, a boulangerie bakery cafe that had prices of Paris, and had some good almond croissants and coffee! (though cafe in Italy still ranks higher in my mind). <br /><span style="color: #993300;">Dinner</span>: 10 course wedding banquet at Vancouver&#8217;s famous Sun Sui Wah. Wasn&#8217;t sure what it was (stress or overtired maybe?) that I couldn&#8217;t stomach too much and by the time the evening came to a close, my stomach was burning up in pain. Alas.<br />While I was occupied, j.w had his fill of sushi for lunch, and crab poutine and some other delicious food at Stevenson for dinner and <span id="result_box" class="short_text" lang="zh-TW"><span>&#35910;&#33104;</span><span>&#33457;</span></span>&#65279;, one of his favourite desserts, in Richmond. I&#8217;m glad that She/R took him to Stevenson, as it was on my itinerary of taking him there someday (I personally don&#8217;t remember what it looks like).</li>




<li><strong>Sunday</strong><br /><a title="IMG_0462 by b.p., on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aimeili/6958960548/"><img style="float: left;" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8166/6958960548_26670c28dc_q.jpg" alt="IMG_0462" width="150" height="150" /></a><span style="color: #993300;">Lunch</span>: with Mich and Tunger, She, Becks and Cire, and Waiki&#8217;s brother. I found it tremendously amusing to hear Cire comment about the likeness of mannerisms in my sister and I &#8211; that&#8217;s probably why Tunger thought I was her to begin with once upon a time. Lunch was followed by a large mango tapoica drink at Crystal Mall for $3.75, but I think I like 8 Juice more at Aberdeen Centre for their mango pomelo drink.<br /><span style="color: #993300;">Dinner</span>: a home cooked meal with fresh salmon served two ways: cedar plank smoked BBQ and fried with black bean and garlic. and prawns, both from Stevenson.</li>




<li><strong>Monday</strong><br /><span style="color: #993300;">Lunch</span>: with my grandparents at Lin&#8217;s, a place known for its <span id="result_box" class="short_text" lang="zh-TW"><span>&#23567;&#31840;&#21253;</span></span>&#65279;,&nbsp; steamed pork dumplings with its juice wrapped in thin, delicate skin. I also enjoyed their <span id="result_box" class="short_text" lang="zh-TW"><span class="alt-edited">&#32005;</span><span>&#27833;</span></span>&#65279;<span id="result_box" class="short_text" lang="zh-TW"><span>&#28818;</span></span>&#65279;<span id="result_box" class="short_text" lang="zh-TW"><span class="trans-target">&#25163;</span></span>&#65279; (but was thirsty after)<br /><span style="color: #993300;">Dinne</span>r:&#65279;$1 oysters at Monk McQueen&#8217;s, along with a pick of fish tacos for my main. I&#8217;d say that it isn&#8217;t really worth it at regular price without a BOGO free entertainment book coupon, but the $1 oysters were a deal at half price on Mondays and Tuesdays: not fishy or slimey.&#65279;</li>




<li><strong>Tuesday</strong><br /><a title="IMG_0627 by b.p., on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aimeili/7155648606/"><img style="float: right;" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8018/7155648606_8588c441d9_q.jpg" alt="IMG_0627" width="150" height="150" /></a><span style="color: #993300;">Lunch</span>: we treked to Deer Garden in Richmond (a return from Christmas) to have their u-pick soup noodle. This time I was a bit smarter and split a bowl with my mom, and was still plenty full after! We also certainly got our fill of <span id="result_box" class="short_text" lang="zh-TW"><span class="alt-edited">&#32769;&#23110;</span><span class="alt-edited">&#39173;</span></span>&#65279; from Kam Do Bakery, but it was bought for later breakfasts at home.<br /><span style="color: #993300;">Dinner</span>: met up with friends at a Korean sushi restaurant, a old funeral home in the past and finished the evening with a giant deep-friend ice cream ball from Hi Genki (and bumped into Mich as well!)</li>




<li>A week later on <strong>Tuesday</strong> for dinner: large-portioned meals at the One, including super-sized slushies (found it still to be really sweet even at half sweet, and semi-artificial)</li>




<li><strong>Wednesday:</strong> <br /><span style="color: #993300;">Breakfast</span>: My brother recommended an &#8220;authentic&#8221; HK breakfast cafe in Richmond called Lido for their &#33760;&#34367;&#27833;&#65279; (pure slice of butter in between a freshly baked pineapple bun). I paired it with some <span id="result_box" class="short_text" lang="zh-TW"><span>&#38634;</span></span>&#65279;<span id="result_box" class="short_text" lang="zh-TW"><span>&#33756;</span><span>&#32905;</span></span>&#65279;<span class="l">&#32114;<span class="l">&#20844;&#20180;&#40629;.</span>&#65279;</span>&#65279;Turns out, it was the only breakfast place that I&#8217;ve been to in Richmond; Stephen Siu, a old CCFer had taken me there once when he was in town and had showed me the ACF office nearby, but I only had macaroni soup there that time.</li>


</ol>




<p>&nbsp;It&#8217;s no wonder why I am constantly hungry now.&#65279;</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				<![CDATA[This list is really to help as a reference since many people have asked me for ideas on what to do and where to go to eat in Montreal and Ottawa as first-timers, here are my picks/recommendations which may or may not suit everyone, depending on their preferences:


<h3>Ottawa:</h3>




<ol>
    

<li><strong>Parliament Hill</strong> (tours conducted in English or French &#8211; multiple daily) &#8211; be sure to go up to the clock tower (has a nice view of Ottawa) &#8211; Free (note: you will need to go through a security check but cameras area allowed on site). At night, the building might light up for a display and changing of the guard on certain days and times.</li>


    

<li><strong>Canadian Museum of Civilization</strong> (Gatineau)</li>


    

<li>If you&#8217;re into Thai food,<strong> Siam Bistro</strong> at the other end of Somerset Ave (other direction than Chinatown) is a bit slow and a bit expensive, but I like their dishes.</li>


    

<li>Seeing the locks and how they work at <strong>Rideau Canal</strong> is neat, but if you&#8217;ve been to Panama canal, it&#8217;s no big deal &#8211; my old notes say it&#8217;s beside Chateau Laurier (nice hotel &#8211; royalty stay there, use their restrooms inside to see what I mean)</li>


    

<li>They have to try a <strong>Beavertail</strong> (near the Byward Market though also available in Old <span class="il">Montreal</span> somewhere)</li>


    

<li>Walk around the <strong>Byward Market</strong></li>


    

<li><strong>Royal Canadian Mint</strong> &#8211; sign up for the tour and if you go on a weekday, you may be able to see them make the coins</li>


    

<li>If you like airplanes, there&#8217;s also the <strong>Canadian Aviation and Space museum</strong>, but I don&#8217;t remember much of it</li>


</ol>




<h3><span class="il">Montreal</span>:</h3>




<ol>
    

<li><strong>Botanical Gardens</strong> &#8211; especially at night for the <a href="http://www2.ville.montreal.qc.ca/jardin/en/propos/lanternes.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lantern Festival</a> display (must see if right season &#8211; in the Autumn)
<a title="Lights by b.p., on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aimeili/1539766298/"><img src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2345/1539766298_4f821e9e87.jpg" alt="Lights" width="400" height="300"/></a></li>


    

<li>If you like penguins and animals, then the <strong>Biodome</strong></li>


    

<li><strong><span class="il">Montreal</span> bagels: St. Viateur</strong> (there are a number of them, so you might want to try and look for the one that you can sit down if you don&#8217;t want to just do take-out) &#8211; look for the St. Viateur Bagel and Cafe sign (<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aimeili/1547259044/in/set-72157602365174063/lightbox/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://www.flickr.com/photos/aimeili/1547259044/in/set-72157602365174063/lightbox/</a>)</li>


    

<li><strong>Schwartz&#8217; (for <span class="il">Montreal</span> smoked meat)</strong> and nearby: <strong>Juliet et Chocolat (for crepes)</strong>
<a title="IMG_9010 by b.p., on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aimeili/5777902237/"><img src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5067/5777902237_ece1f95bf7.jpg" alt="IMG_9010" width="400" height="277"/></a></li>


    

<li>Walk around <strong>Old </strong><span class="il"><strong>Montrea</strong>l</span> &#8211; if you get hungry around there and don&#8217;t want to eat in Chinatown, then eat at <strong>Chez Suzette&#8217;s for their savoury crepes</strong> (in Old <span class="il">Montreal</span>)</li>


    

<li><strong>Chinatown for egg tarts</strong> (best at the corner / last shop on the street called <strong>Patisserie Harmonie</strong>&#8211; it&#8217;s 50 cents each and so good)and HK style cafe at<strong> La Legende Patisserie</strong><a title="IMG_9156 by b.p., on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aimeili/5842916654/"><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3647/5842916654_bb069dc5ac_m.jpg" alt="IMG_9156" width="180" height="133"/></a><a title="IMG_9007 by b.p., on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aimeili/5774462402/"><img src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2229/5774462402_a92d3c96e8.jpg" alt="IMG_9007" width="180" height="133"/></a></li>


    

<li>If you want <strong>poutine</strong> (which is icky in my mind but a typical French Canadian food), try it at <strong>La Banquise</strong><a title="IMG_9476 by b.p., on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aimeili/5842382601/"><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3563/5842382601_3207e3498c.jpg" alt="IMG_9476" width="400" height="277"/></a></li>


    

<li><strong>St. Joseph&#8217;s oratory</strong> and the lookout points at <strong>Mont Royal</strong></li>


    

<li>Jeremy&#8217;s church is <strong><span class="il">Montreal</span> Chinese Alliance Church</strong></li>


    

<li>Slightly expensive but good (and huge portions, perfect for sharing) <strong>brunch place after church: Le Petite Marche</strong> &#8211; it&#8217;s in the heart of the French community so it might be better if you knew some French<a title="IMG_8997 by b.p., on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aimeili/5773920021/"><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3149/5773920021_dd6d2ba7f0.jpg" alt="IMG_8997" width="400" height="277"/></a></li>


    

<li>If open, any <strong>Premiere Moisson</strong> bakery is great for dessert and pastries</li>


</ol>


Additional food stuff for Montreal:


<ul>
    

<li>Gourmet chocolates at (I went to Atwater Market so if you&#8217;re comfortable with French then you&#8217;ll be fine&#8230;I wasn&#8217;t but was still fine)</li>


    

<li>Coffee and beer is good in <span class="il">Montreal</span> too. I just can&#8217;t remember the names of specifics.</li>


    

<li>there&#8217;s this mediterranean/lebanese seafood restaurant that we went to where we get to pick you own fish at the fish market and they fry it up for you! so freesh and the salads were great.<a title="IMG_2873 by b.p., on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aimeili/2823678520/"><img src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2250/2823678520_5c2eb6fc68.jpg" alt="IMG_2873" width="400" height="277"/></a>
but it&#8217;s a TAD on the pricy side. too bad I can&#8217;t remember what it was called. it may been: <a href="http://www.yelp.ca/biz/restaurant-la-sirene-de-la-mer-montreal" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://www.yelp.ca/biz/restaurant-la-sirene-de-la-mer-<span class="il">montreal</span></a></li>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				<![CDATA[

<p>I had wanted to go to Niagara-on-the-Lake for a quiet weekend getaway, without knowing that all reasonable accommodations were fully booked. Tobermory was another choice, but they too were full. So what do I do? Look in our <i>Where to Eat in Canada</i> book for some inspiration, hoping that we might be able to find a place that would at least have some good food!</p>




<p>Enter Port Stanley: an hour and a half drive from Waterloo. Half an hour from London, and on the north side of Lake Erie. A town with only one traffic light, and a lift bridge (that didn&#8217;t lift when we were there). Calm, serene, and peaceful. And, it offers two sand beaches: Little Beach (one more suitable for quiet lounging) and the Main Beach &#8211; long stretch of beach, big waves, and lifeguards on duty. Plus, everything is within walking distance.</p>


<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aimeili/4962513628/" title="IMG_7073 by b.p., on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4092/4962513628_728272efcf.jpg" width="400" height="266" alt="IMG_7073" /></a>


<p>We started the weekend with cool weather, on the tourist train, much like the St. Jacob&#8217;s train, but with open windows. Unfortunately, the engine broke down halfway through our trip and we ended up being stranded for awhile &#8211; until they could bring another engine to push the train. We ended the night with a play <i>Wrong for Each Other</i> at the local festival theatre, and it was especially comical, because we actually do &#8220;fight&#8221; like that sometimes.</p>


<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aimeili/4962425790/" title="IMG_6868 by b.p., on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4127/4962425790_e403fded9e.jpg" width="400" height="266" alt="IMG_6868" /></a>


<p>On the first day, we visited the two restaurants that were mentioned in <i>Where to Eat in Canada</i>: M.E. and Suzie&#8217;s for a late lunch and Windjammer Inn for dinner before the show. We quickly found out that Lake Erie Yellow Perch is the local specialty &#8211; fresh tasting too: light and not fishy. We loved the way Windjammer made the perch (served with seasonal veggies) and their flourless dark chocolate cake was amazing: warm and not too sweet or rich! M.E. and Suzie&#8217;s own brew seemed good, and their ale and white cheddar soup was certainly unique (and not too salty surprisingly). Both places had hot bread: crispy on the outside, moist and soft on the inside. One even had lime or lemon zest in/taste to it.</p>


<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aimeili/4962493022/" title="IMG_7007 by b.p., on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4085/4962493022_bf94ed505d_m.jpg" width="200" height="133" alt="IMG_7007" /></a><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aimeili/4962442440/" title="IMG_6890 by b.p., on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4084/4962442440_a671fa88de_m.jpg" width="200" height="133" alt="IMG_6890" /></a>


<p>It wasn&#8217;t only at the restaurants where we enjoyed good food. We had stumbled upon a great bed and breakfast: the <a href="http://www.telegraphhouse.com/index.php/Accommodations/Index" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Telegraph House</a>. Of the many places we tried to inquire about room availability, this one was the only one that had an opening at a fair price. So, due to limited choices, we took the last room that was available, not certain if we ended up with an okay place.</p>




<p>What we got was more than expected &#8211; loose leaf tea available for guests, a room that was spacious, had great lighting, and enough privacy and freedom that I felt like we were at an inn instead of a B&#038;B. The bed looked soft; you could put you palm on it and it would sink, but when I slept on it, it felt firm enough. I hadn&#8217;t slept on a feather bed before, but if that&#8217;s what it feels like, it was comfortable. The only down side for this room is that the bathroom is down the hall (knew before booking) and fireplace wasn&#8217;t on yet, despite the chilly first night. One bonus is that if your own private washroom was occupied, the other person could use the public one without it being too far away.</p>

<p>I was already drawn to this B&#038;B when I saw their breakfast menu online and the variety of choices. I guess one might expect good food from Jon and Vicci (the hosts), considering they owned a restaurant in London once upon a time and that the public dining room (at the time of operation) at the B&#038;B is the third top-rated place in Port Stanley on Restaurantica.com &#8211; after M.E &#038;  Suzie&#8217;s, Winjammer Inn, and then Mackie&#8217;s. When even locals recommend it, including the server at Windjammer Inn, you know that you are at the right spot.  As one who takes every opportunity to sleep-in, I wasn&#8217;t about to sleep-in and miss this breakfast!</p>

<p>Oh, and let&#8217;s not forget about the lemon meringue pie! Earlier in the day, a local from St. Thomas had raved about their deep-dish rhubarb pie, so she was surprised to find out that they closed the dining room to the public. Vicci didn&#8217;t have rhubarb (not in season is my guess), but she let us try the lemon meringue instead. What a pleasant surprise: a light, not-to-sweet summery pie and the meringue itself wasn&#8217;t stiff at all &#8211; you could almost see the lemon zest in the setting sun!</p>

<h3>Day 4 and 5: Charlottetown</h3>


The last two days were spent around Charlottetown, where Jopoo would be spending the next six weeks.
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aimeili/4538999507/" title="IMG_3150 by b.p., on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4063/4538999507_42f47c07e1.jpg" width="400" height="266" alt="IMG_3150" /></a>
<br />We moved away from the B&amp;Bs to a great low season rate at the Prince Edward Delta, which they also gave us a free upgrade, and a complimentary day of parking because our heat mysteriously stopped working. The beds look lumpy but they&#8217;re quite comfortable. At least they did something, unlike the Best Western Hampton (which curtly informed me that they turn off the heat during the spring/summer months).
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aimeili/4539634354/" title="IMG_3177 by b.p., on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4054/4539634354_d133b8f73d.jpg" width="400" height="266" alt="IMG_3177" /></a>
<br />We visited Off Broadway (also recommended by <i>Where to Eat in Canada</i>), for a late supper one night, and the seafood chowder was just amazing &#8211; filling enough for a meal unto its own.
<center><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aimeili/4539000137/" title="IMG_3202 by b.p., on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2781/4539000137_8415748376_m.jpg" width="133" height="200" alt="IMG_3202" /></a> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aimeili/4539001125/" title="IMG_3262 by b.p., on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4036/4539001125_a05d70b01d_m.jpg" width="133" height="200" alt="IMG_3262" /></a></center><br />
The first night&#8217;s dessert was from j.w&#8217;s $30 prix fixe menu, which was a lovely gingerbread parfait that wasn&#8217;t too sweet. The second evening, while j.w was in the game store (again) Jopoo and I settled on Starbucks after asking for recommendations from the hotel concierge and not finding any! That&#8217;s okay though, because it was my manager&#8217;s treat (gift card) :).
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aimeili/4539634802/" title="IMG_3207 by b.p., on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2782/4539634802_ef3754d18f_m.jpg" width="200" height="133" alt="IMG_3207" /></a> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aimeili/4539000327/" title="IMG_3210 by b.p., on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4011/4539000327_b69550dbbf_m.jpg" width="200" height="133" alt="IMG_3210" /></a>
<br />
<center><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aimeili/4539000413/" title="IMG_3216 by b.p., on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2765/4539000413_5a5a4bd830.jpg" width="400" height="266" alt="IMG_3216" /></a></center>
<br />After an unexpected experience at the Penny Pincher Fair on Saturday morning (which to me is a fancy term for &#8220;collective garage sale with admission&#8221;) with a security guard greeting us in Mandarin, then Korean, we decided to try Zen Sushi Bar, a Japanese restaurant downtown which advertised a 2 for 1 lunch special. Not only was it cheap ($6.50 for both the planko fish meal and a sukiyaki meal, making it $3.25 each), it was owned by true Japanese folks. And the food was good! This was easily the best value and better tasting lunches we had. The volcano roll, though a bit pricey averaged our meal was so good that one didn&#8217;t need any extra wasabi or soya sauce.
Sunday service at <a href="http://charlottetowncommunitychurch.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Charlottetown Community Church</a> was an eye-opening experience. People were friendly, the keyboardist even came up to us afterwards to greet us. They seemed to reflect their name: community. People were open and transparent, even in communion. I can count how many times a church told its congregation (in a non-members meeting) how much each of its staff makes: 1. This church. One conversation had me chuckling though: one lady asked Jopoo, who is younger, if I was her daughter <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f61b.png" alt="😛" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
Charlottetown is also home to a culinary institute, which I found wasn&#8217;t as good as our local Conestoga College&#8217;s Conestoga Dining Room. The dishes were pricier, and the fish in my seafood bouillabaisse seemed a bit overcooked. But, the view is much nicer!
A few randoms:
<br />At the Confederation Bridge, it suggests that you donate to a parking meter if you enjoyed the view. And, for our last meal together, the siblings enjoyed a lobster meal at Seatreat for lunch.

<h3>Day 2: Continued</h3>




<p><a title="IMG_2962 by b.p., on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aimeili/4539140939/"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2708/4539140939_3bcfe57d1e.jpg" alt="IMG_2962" width="400" height="250" /></a><br /> We made it to Antigonish for dinner and to settle for the night at Rose &amp; Thistle B&amp;B after getting around the east side of the Cabot Trail (and this time, knew better than to take the unpaved roads to Meat Cove).</p>




<p><a title="IMG_3049 by b.p., on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aimeili/4539632146/"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4052/4539632146_06b8961f69.jpg" alt="IMG_3049" width="200" height="133" /></a> <a title="IMG_3057 by b.p., on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aimeili/4538997955/"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2719/4538997955_e21362e7fb_m.jpg" alt="IMG_3057" width="200" height="133" /></a> <br />Another choice from <em>Where to Eat in Canada</em> &#8211; the green Thai curry styled mussels at The Alcove Bistro, which was a very flavourful dish. The chicken wrap worked really well in a phyllo pastry instead of a tortilla wrap.</p>




<h3>Day 3: Onward to PEI</h3>




<p>Friday was spent touring around PEI after a healthy breakfast at the B&amp;B, including visiting some gift shops and the north coastal drive.</p>


<center><a title="IMG_3062 by b.p., on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aimeili/4539632474/"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4046/4539632474_3e76bc3a72_m.jpg" alt="IMG_3062" width="160" height="240" /></a> <a title="IMG_3123 by b.p., on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aimeili/4539633364/"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4032/4539633364_65bbe0f7a9_m.jpg" alt="IMG_3123" width="160" height="240" /></a></center>


<p>Despite not seeing any coyote (yay!) or moose on our trip, Jopoo spotted a fox crossing the road, and when we turned around to stop and take some photos, not only did we see one but two (a male and female) &#8211; they didn&#8217;t even seem very afraid of the humans at all and tried to approach the vehicle a few times, until the mechanical sounds of a window or door would momentarily frighten them. We also visited the grounds of Anne of Green Gables and because neither of them had read the books and since I&#8217;ve been before, we opted not to pay to visit the house (was free of charge to tour the grounds).</p>




<p><a title="IMG_3146 by b.p., on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aimeili/4539633918/"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2780/4539633918_6ccac9dc42.jpg" alt="IMG_3146" width="400" height="266" /></a><br />Here&#8217;s the soap drying room at <a href="http://www.greatcanadiansoap.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Great Canadian Soap</a>, which is made from their own goats&#8217; milk! Jopoo and I spent so much time in there smelling all the fragrant soap, collecting some samples, and deciding which ones to buy while j.w got bored and waited in the car with a book. In the end, everyone got some soap, including a chocolate muffin (soap).</p>




<p>The last few days of our trip were spent in Charlottetown just relaxing.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>


When Canada won (an Olympic medal), Air Canada had a great <a href="http://forums.redflagdeals.com/air-canada-buy-one-get-one-free-within-canada-through-april-30-feb-22-only-857787/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">buy one get one free</a> offer. We jumped on the opportunity and bought 2 tickets, taking the risk that <a href="http://jopoo.blogspot.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">jopoo</a> was actually going to PEI. At that time, we didn&#8217;t know that many places would be closed during low season. However, despite not being able to try famous lobster suppers, go whale watching, or hike the Skyline Trail, we were able to get great accommodation rates, eat *incredibly* well, and spend time with each other! I&#8217;m always amazed how God answers my little pleas for adequate weather and holds off the snow and rain until we are inside (minus the Saturday, which I didn&#8217;t pray for anyway :P).


<h3>Day 1: Arrival into Charlottetown</h3>


The flight from Toronto was surprisingly smooth. I had always thought smaller planes were more turbulent but it didn&#8217;t even shake when the drinks were served (which always seem to happen at that exact moment). On our flight of 16 rows (2&#215;2), we had at least 3 families who were Mandarin speaking Chinese; I almost expected to see more of them on our trip after j.w drove through an A&amp;W and a Chinese girl gave him his order. But, I think they were only limited in Charlottetown.
After landing, we picked up our rental and set off to Cheticamp, Nova Scotia (locals seem to pronounce it She-tee-camp). We drove halfway across the province before realizing that the GPS was taking us to the ferry (which is closed until May) so we turned around and went the other way. Thankfully we had unlimited mileage on our rental <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
<a title="IMG_3083 by b.p., on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aimeili/4538998305/"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2788/4538998305_f9c75d0f32.jpg" alt="IMG_3083" width="400" height="266" /></a> <br />We crossed the Confederation Bridge to get to Nova Scotia, driving through New Brunswick along the way.
<a title="IMG_2928 by b.p., on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aimeili/4539630472/"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4002/4539630472_03e64cd8f9_m.jpg" alt="IMG_2928" width="160" height="240" align="right" /></a>


<p style="padding-right: 5px;">We stopped in Antigonish at <a href="http://twitter.com/Gabrieaus" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gabrieau&#8217;s Bistro</a> for dinner, which had one of the most awesome seafood chowders that we had on this trip &#8211; this one <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aimeili/4539630308/in/set-72157623775595257/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">came with a puff!</a> The butter for the bread was cold and hard, but the actual food itself was simply satisfying.</p>


We arrived at Cheticamp, after a dark, snowy drive (and relied on the GPS to anticipate the curves in the road), just as the lady was about to turn in (and give up on us &#8211; we had no reception). Her breakfast was quite filling! J.w <a href="http://twitter.com/bptweets/status/12257825764" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">loved her homemade pancakes</a>, but I enjoyed the blueberry muffins so much that I forgot to take a photo of it (crunchy on the outside, but soft on the inside)!
&nbsp;


<h3>Day 2: Cabot Trail, Nova Scotia</h3>


Our hostess, Veronica at <a href="http://cheticampns.com/2015/08/05/cheticamp-outfitters-bb/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cheticamp Outfitters B&amp;B</a> kept us engaged with her stories (including scary ones like how the coyotes got one of her guests). Actually, the only times I have stayed in a bed and breakfast is in the Maritimes (incl. Newfoundland), and my first one was on the Maritime trip in 2003. With our stomachs full, we headed off to Cape Breton National Park and begin the drive around the Cabot Trail.
<a title="IMG_2944 by b.p., on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aimeili/4539630964/"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4017/4539630964_fd17698673.jpg" alt="IMG_2944" width="400" height="266" /></a> <br />With scenery like this all the way, and lookout points every five minutes, how can one not stop along the way to appreciate God&#8217;s creation and the beautiful country that we live in?
And while the park staff recommended us not to go on the Skyline trail and other hikes that were higher up (due to unmaintained snow covered trails and coyotes), they were still able to circle a few that we could try. Through her kindness, we also received a free park permit for the day. Despite the short walks, the view didn&#8217;t disappoint.
<a title="IMG_3032 by b.p., on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aimeili/4538997697/"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4032/4538997697_9ddd6dea4e.jpg" alt="IMG_3032" width="400" height="266" /></a><br />And thankfully, no coyotes even though I half expected to see a pack of them jump out (from the recent news coverage of them). No moose either, even though we saw moose droppings.

Recommendations? One disadvantage of going off-season is that many places are closed, including lobster suppers, whale watching tours, and some bed &#038; breakfasts

<p>After talking to Dr. Wu (someone I met last time), I was reminded that I haven&#8217;t been back for 5 years already! I still remember it as if it was only a few years ago.</p>

Halifax highlights:


<ul>


<li>Friday evening: Josh picked us up from airport and dropped us at <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/aimeili/2572218130/in/set-72157605568882639/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fenwick Hall</a></li>




<li>Saturday: <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/aimeili/2572215844/in/set-72157605568882639/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Peggy&#8217;s cove</a>, <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/aimeili/2571392411/in/set-72157605568882639/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lunenburg</a> (home of the bluenose) for fish &#038; chips lunch, stop at <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/aimeili/2571392899/in/set-72157605568882639/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mahone Bay</a>, romantic dinner at <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/aimeili/2571393293/in/set-72157605568882639/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cut</a> (<a href="http://www.eng.uwaterloo.ca/~sm2wong/IGuessSo.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">with &#8220;paparazzi&#8221;</a>) &#8211; a story may follow another day &#8211; followed by a harbour cruise in a <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/aimeili/2572217900/in/set-72157605568882639/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tall ship</a>.</li>




<li>Sunday: Service at HCCC &#8211; it&#8217;s smaller than I remembered and the only people left that I remembered were Dr. Wu, Josh and Calvin. Josh also hung out with us that day and we spent most of it along the harbour  with <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/aimeili/2571394023/in/set-72157605568882639/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lunch at the Harbourside market</a> then over to Fisherman&#8217;s Cove and <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/aimeili/2572220088/in/set-72157605568882639/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dartmouth</a> for the evening. I haven&#8217;t been to Fisherman&#8217;s Cove before so it was a nice stop. Mich and j.w had <a <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/aimeili/2572219938/in/set-72157605568882639/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lobster</a>. The <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/aimeili/2571397075/in/set-72157605568882639/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Old Burial Grounds</a> were closed (disappointingly since last time, my friends thought it was creepy if I took photos)</li>




<li>Monday: brunch at <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/aimeili/2571396221/in/set-72157605568882639/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Your Father&#8217;s Moustache</a> (pub grub) and after <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/aimeili/2572220520/in/set-72157605568882639/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">around the Citadel</a> and <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/aimeili/2572221492/in/set-72157605568882639/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Public Gardens</a></li>




<li>Halifax weather is unpredictable. The forecast says it&#8217;s hot but it turns out to be quite cool/cold so the next day, I figured it would be the same but it was hot today (thankfully much less humid and sticky than Ontario) and now we&#8217;re as red as a lobster (speaking of which, this time McLobsters weren&#8217;t available until Canada Day &#8211; j.w was sooo disappointed)</li>




<li>The people at the Tim Horton&#8217;s (in the Halifax airport) asked Mich and I if we were Filipinos!</li>




<li>The security guy at YYZ asked us if the sheets where we printed our boarding pass on were math questions &#8211; we told him it was Japanese.</li>




<li>Great WestJet jokes!</li>


</ul>

<p>Perhaps more about these another day <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
