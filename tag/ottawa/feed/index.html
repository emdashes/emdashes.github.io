								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Jesus once said:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
&#8220;Watch out that no one deceives you. For many will come in my name, claiming, &#8216;I am the Christ,&#8217; and will deceive many. You will hear of wars and rumors of wars, but see to it that you are not alarmed. Such things must happen, but the end is still to come. Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be famines and earthquakes in various places. All these are the beginning of birth pains.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you will be handed over to be persecuted and put to death, and you will be hated by all nations because of me. At that time many will turn away from the faith and will betray and hate each other, and many false prophets will appear and deceive many people. Because of the increase of wickedness, the love of most will grow cold, but he who stands firm to the end will be saved. And this gospel of the kingdom will be preached in the whole world as a testimony to all nations, and then the end will come.&#8221; &#8211; <a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?book_id=47&#038;chapter=24&#038;version=31&#038;context=chapter" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Matthew 24:4-14</a></p></blockquote>
<p>
As we walked around downtown Ottawa this past long weekend, I was amazed at the number of people who proclaimed that the world was going to end. One &#8220;busker&#8221; even had a crowd listening to him as he drew diagrams, another &#8220;preached&#8221; via what sounded like rap, and yet another had a sign saying that the end of the world was on July 24th, and the only way to repentance was through Jesus. I haven&#8217;t seen so many of these in awhile, and it reminded me of the man who was trying to give away free Gideon Bibles at the intersection of Eaton Centre. To balance that out, if I was in Ottawta for the very first time, I would say that racism also thrives there. As the four of us were walking back on Sparks Street from watching, <a href="http://www.wkw-inthemoodforlove.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">In the Mood for Love</a> at Bytowne Cinema, we heard remarks like &#8220;China!&#8221; or &#8220;Ni hao!&#8221; from people walking by and laughing, or even from across the street &#8211; not like all of us were Chinese. What really bothered me was that one of them had a kid sitting on top of his shoulders; what a role model.
</p>
<p>
Speaking of which, that film (by Wong Kar Wai) was the first Chinese that I have seen in a very long time that was artistically abstract (vague) and ended up to be quite good (much better than Hero) &#8211; quite suiting for Cannes. The cinematography was done exceptionally well and the symbols and themes (songs, scenes, shots, etc.) were perfect for classroom (or discussion) analysis. I am interested in seeing the sequel &#8211; 2046. My only complaint was that the story was a little slow, the characters&#8217; facial expressions were somewhat lacking, and certain scenes didn&#8217;t make too much sense.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				Aiya, I&#8217;ve been falling asleep all day! Even at work, and in EVERY one of my classes&#8211;the teacher even called on me when I was sleeping :(, but thankfully, I was able to answer the question correctly because I was drifting in and out. I think the lack of a good night&#8217;s rest from the weekend and from last week has really caught up with me. I even fell asleep while in a conversation with the driver yesterday (*sheepish look*).</p>
<p>
The weekend was awesome! Melody and I got a ride from my supervisor from work to Ottawa in a  Hyundai Accent. Ironic that the driver rarely signals, even though he was once a driving instructor. But, he was kind enough to only charge us for gas (total $20) and drove Mel to and from &#8216;Sauga :)! The ride there took about 6 hours (excluding 1 hr for lunch (Swiss Chalet) in Belleville), but because there was traffic from Kingston to Toronto, the ride back was an exceedingly long 8 hours w/o a long stop.
</p>
<p>
When we finally arrived, we headed out to Chinatown to eat dinner at&#8230;Man&#8217;s Kitchen. heh. Marc had to do prestudy, so J, Mel, and I had the usual stuff there. &#8216;cept Mel and I weren&#8217;t too hungry b/c we had lunch late (14h30). After loitering at the church, waiting for Marcy, we dropped Derrick&#8217;s cell off in Centrepointe, and the went to Poon&#8217;s to play some &#8220;board games&#8221; (which ended up to be video console games for some after awhile)&#8211;BoGGLE and Dutch Blitz. I haven&#8217;t played Blitz in sooo long :). Tho&#8217; Mel and I weren&#8217;t &#8220;hungry&#8221;, Dom, J, Mel, and I went to Elgin Street Diner to have some food/dessert. I had a yummy piece of Triple Chocolate Cheesecake. I love cheesecake (yes, even tho i am lactose intolerant). Dom treated us all! Thanks Dom :).
</p>
<p>
By then, I was about to collapse b/c I was so tired (only mustered 3 hrs of sleep the night before because of an assignment that I wanted to finish before going away for the weekend). However, Mel and I stayed up talking til about 5:00 am, and although I had 3 hours of sleep again, she didn&#8217;t get a wink at all (new environment, etc.)! She said that it was one of the longest 3 hrs of her life :(.
</p>
<p>
Gettin up early to take a shower in a very ghetto bathroom was a very hard thing to do, especially when the toilet doesn&#8217;t flush properly. But, we got outta the house by 9 AM (in which I woke up J, but I left him be after the agonizing pain of tiredness he seemed to be in), and headed toward Parliament Hill. Interestingly enough, the place wasn&#8217;t packed and we didn&#8217;t haveta wait for the next tour. Additionally, this time, they didn&#8217;t find my swiss army knife in my bag, which is very odd. For my 2nd English tour, and my 3rd tour overall, I still learned something new: the stones on the walls are fossilized and are from Manitoba! if one looks carefully, one can see some fossil imprints remaining in the outer surfaces of the walls. And, you know how I thought that one of the portraits was stolen in a fire or something? Well, in reality, one of the paintings were cut out and saved when the Parliament burnt down&#8211;must be my poor understanding of French.. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
</p>
<p>
After the tour, we headed over to the Canadian Mint to book a reservation for 3:30 PM (b/c it was then quite full). As Mel and I were quite hungry, after showing her some of the neat stores that were along Sussex, we had lunch at my fav restaurant in the Market area, The Blue Cactus&#8211;yes, I like their food (quantity and quality) for their price and the atmosphere. Soon before we finished, Dom dropped by and waited for us to clear out before taking us to the Fall Rhapsody in Gatineau Park. The trees were really nice (tho&#8217; I don&#8217;t get why it&#8217;s such an &#8220;in&#8221; thing here as it&#8217;s almost like Spring or Fall at Burnaby Mountain).
</p>

<i>Oct 22, 2002</i>
</p>
<p>
I finally get to finish my update! We bumped into Ma-chew and S&#8217;ree as they headed to seek out Nate and Viv. Apparently, they bumped into them 1/4 into the trails since they went counter-direction-wise to them. But, we couldn&#8217;t stay b/c of the Cdn Mint tour. They apparently spelled Singapore wrong in one of their displays, and since it&#8217;s really getting to me that they&#8217;d have such a blatant spelling mistake, I e-mailed them just now. HA :).  Apparently, I hum a lot. I notice that too now that Mel has pted it out over the weekend :). Ah wells. Music is everything, as DD once pted out: w/o music, one would not be as easily moved to do anything. Shortly after the tour (in which a 50-cent coin wasn&#8217;t actually face value, but twice of what it is), Dom suggested that we go to Piccolo Grande! Yum!, I totally forgot about gelato in Ottawa :). As we waited for Josh to show, we eached enjoyed a cup full (Papaya and Mango for me! :þ). As appetites go, dessert came before dinner. We ended up at  Canal Ritz, which is this lil restaurant on Rideau Canal. The portions are not too bad. For a small size (they have large too), the food is sure filling! Thankfully, we made it on time for Elijah (even though they started characteristically late). There was some lack of organisation, but when things finally started going, they progressed into a Bible Study on &#8220;Knowing God&#8221;. Quite interesting. Unfortunately, we had &#8220;dessert&#8221; at Chu-Shing b/c apparently MK was really humid. I say unfortunately b/c there&#8217;s never anything good to eat there. Mel and I had a really hard time getting up the next morning for church. Thankfully, Mel had some sleep that night (as opposed to the first), but I think both of us had a hard time being attentive to PDjr. I do remember that the sermon had to do with Thanksgiving tho :P.
</p>
<p>
Shao (i have never met him before), Matt&#8217;s friend from UW, treated Mel and I for lunch as the 4 of us ate pho at Tu Du (or something like that). Unfortunately, it was raining that day, so we kinda got wet. Fortunately for us, Marc&#8217;s dad drove us to South Keys so that we didn&#8217;t have to take the bus and get wet. Ma-Chew and S&#8217;ree (hmm, I make it sound like they&#8217;re a couple in this entry) joined us at Cineplex before Jonah:A Veggie Tales Movie began. For those that have yet to see it, STAY for the credits and pay attention :). I think that was the second movie that I actually closed my eyes in&#8211;Marc and Mel too I think. We were all so tired. However, my ears were still wide open so I didn&#8217;t miss anything :). The whole theatre comprised of kids and their parents. We were the only ones that didn&#8217;t have kids or our parents there :P. Thx to Marc for the movie :).
</p>
<p>
Took Mel on the OCTranspo because we had to bus to Orlèans as we had an invitation to the Thanksgiving dinner that Marc&#8217;s family provided. Yum. I was really full afterwards and the three of us were falling asleep. By the time we got home, that&#8217;s what we did :). Woke up early, went to the Market for postcards and a <a href="http://www.beavertailsinc.com/" target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer">BeaverTail</a> <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Had a REALLY quick lunch at Medieo Bistro (i thk that&#8217;s what its called). They serve Greek-ish food at somewhat of a high price but the food is really good. I ordered a 1/2 rack of lamb on greens and I rushed the order. Well, it came out in 10 mins! A lil on the rare side for me, but still edible :). I think if we weren&#8217;t pressed for time, we would&#8217;ve thoroughly enjoyed the atmosphere, food, service :).
</p>
<p>
And here, is where I begun my entry. :).
</p>
<p>
I forgot to mention that on the drive back, Todd took us down Sussex Drive, to places where ambassadors and embassys were, and also to the home of the ex-president of Corel. His house is soooo cold. It&#8217;s all gold/copper, very &#8220;square-ish&#8221;, and has a feel of an institution. Too bad that it didn&#8217;t occur to me to take a picture. I guess it&#8217;s very modern and contemporary, if you can call it that&#8211;reflective of some of the company&#8217;s products/logos (as in graphix not logic), or even ethos perhaps?</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				What a weekend! i spent the weekend playin&#8217; &#8220;tourist&#8221; with two of my high school friends and was it ever fun and we took SOOO many pics (Ann ended up using at least 3 rolls of film)! :). That was fer sure one of my highlights this summer because I was so tired out by the end of the two days that they were here (that was just an abstract of what I&#8217;m going to be detailing :P).<br />
This weekend my cousins went away to Toronto so they opened their house for my friends to stay. Ann went on a &#8220;train&#8221; trip from Vancouver to Montréal and she dropped by Kingston to visit Sue and they both came up to Ottawa to visit the city (and I hope, me!) since Ann&#8217;s ne&#8217;r been here before. Marc kindly picked them up from the bus station at 9h55 and we went back to drop off our bags before taking the bus downtown.<br />
I was already tired from waking up at 7h15 to walk the dog and falling back asleep til 9h00. But, it got me ready for my long day ahead. We went to Byward Market first to show Ann the l&#8217;il stands in the streets and ate lunch at Blue Cactus (yum!) (Oh, COWS is going OOB (out of business) soon so their Ottawa T&#8217;s are 1/2 price). Marc joined us after lunch at the Museum of Civilization in Hull. Just like myself, Ann enjoyed the Children&#8217;s Museum thoroughly; I think Susanne secretly enjoyed it too :). I still like the Historic Town setting in the Museum as well. We spent about 4 hrs in there before walking back to Ottawa (b/c the bus stopped running) and taking the bus home to walk and feed the dog and make dinner. Jon ended up joining us for dinner as well before heading out to downtown again. Susie wanted to stay at home to chill so after many attempts to invite her to join us, we left her to spend time with the dog :).<br />
Although we missed the firewrks (visible from Ottawa side tho from casino du Hull), we ended up going to Parliament Hill to see if we could get a glimpse of the Sound and Light Show on Parliament Hill. The English showing just ended so we ended up just taking pictures of the area and just as we were about to leave, the French version began so we stayed 1/2 hr to see the lights and music; it was really neat  and some of my pictures turned out better than I expected. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Dom, J, and Ange joined us midway and we bumped into Ben Cheung and his family and Jasmine/Jo/Heidi and their families as well&#8211;totally unexpected since they don&#8217;t even live in Ottawa. I can&#8217;t believe that Marc/Jon/etc. d/n tell me about it last year as it apparently is an annual event.<br />
Since Ann wanted to go to Zoe&#8217;s for some jazz and drinks, we all went there and ordered some drinks. The jazz there isn&#8217;t as good as the ones on Thurs and Fris but we saw ppl dancing there anyhow. By the time we were done, the last buses had already left, so Dom kindly drove us home. By the time we got back, it was close to 1h30 and we all went to zzz so that we could get up for church the next day (and for me to walk the dog).<br />
Did you know that <a href="http://www.octranspo.com" target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer">OCTranspo</a> day passes are 2 adults for 1 for &#8220;family&#8221; on Sundays and Holidays?! I hpe the srvice didn&#8217;t scare off Ann or Sue on Sunday as I noticed that a lot of ppl around me were nappin&#8217; during the sermon, tho Connie&#8217;s and Joe&#8217;s sharing were quite interesting :). For a quickie lunch, I took them to&#8230;.MK! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> hahah. Alan served us and gave us the usual discount :). I think Ann was full b/c she ended finishing an entire yeung-chow chow fan! Off to Parliament we went and once again, we had to sign up for the French tour b/c the English one was once again filled up :|. Luckily, Ann sweet-talked our way into the English one once we were inside. I think I must&#8217;ve imagined things but for some reason, I thot one of the portraits on the wall was stolen or damaged before but when I asked if all the portaits were original, the tour-guide said yes. The library was closed for renovations but we were able to go up to the Peace Tower (missed it somehow last time) to see a good view of Ottawa-Hull. Apparently, there&#8217;s a time capsule on the cornerstore of the building that was laid there in 1919.<br />
Before the tour, there was time to kill, so we headed towards the <a href="http://www.mint.ca/en/index_home1.htm" target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer">Canadian Royal Mint</a> for a tour but apparently, the groups were full til past 16h00 so we settled for the <a href="http://www.warmuseum.ca/" target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer">War Museum</a> instead, which apparently is 1/2 price on Sundays AND if you have a group of 4 or less, one can have the family rate as well :). The museum isn&#8217;t too too interesting; not enuff objects and props&#8230;I think the US does a better job with their war/navy/etc. museums and memorials. Ann made a very interest&#8217;g observation dat a lot of the historic info seemed a l&#8217;il one-sided.<br />
That was all the time we had for the day before we headed home to pack and to send them off on their way to Kingston again. We caught up on each others&#8217; lives this weekend and reminiscenced the good ol&#8217; high school years.<br />
News flash: My cos just bought a PS2 (along w GT3) thanks to Jon =). WOOHOO~ Shame that I&#8217;m moving out this week to house-sit for my aunt/uncle in Orléans.		</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				Ah, I can&#8217;t believe how late it is&#8211;both timewise and datewise; the stress and pressure of gettin&#8217; everything done b/4 i head to TO for 2 days (conference) is quite time consuming. Work is piling up both at MOL and w my job in TO&#8230;and the summer is just about over! =(.<br />
PTL!~In 1996, Zeke re-introduced me to a friend of his through a telephone conversation, who soon after became a really good friend of mine.  I remember thinking that when Zeke brought him to church for the very first time before that, Marie and I felt sorry for him b/c he ended up sitting in front of the garbage can in the church library (while we had sunday school). To think that after so many years, he <i>finally</i> <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f61b.png" alt="😛" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> takes the last step and commits his life to Christ =). God sure taught me a lesson there since I almost gave up on prayer and hope completely&#8230;so it&#8217;s been 9 years&#8230;feels like eternity, but it&#8217;s been worth it to see his journey from then to now :). So, everyone who knows Ronald Chan, you&#8217;re cordially invited to his baptism on December 15th at ECC in Seattle, WA. Mark your calendars! =)<br />
The weekend was filled with many events. I wanted to further elaborate on them but because I know if I don&#8217;t sleep soon, I won&#8217;t function properly tomolo, so here&#8217;s the highlights:<br />
<i>Friday evenin&#8217;</i>: Praise and Prayer at Chau Wing and Roger&#8217;s place. Tho&#8217; I likely missed the prayer portion of the night because we left early, I think it was a good size for sharing/etc. Cyn, How, SilQ, Marcy, Roge, Chau Wing, and myself begun the evening w&#8217; sheree, adrian, alice, and nathan joinin&#8217; later. However, the P&amp;P weren&#8217;t as good as I wanted it b/c I found it very chaotic and didn&#8217;t really flow for parts of the night&#8230;but I&#8217;m certain that this group had good fellowship and hang time b/c they ended up stayin&#8217; til 4:30 AM b/c they watched FF and Emperor&#8217;s New Groove.<br />
<i>Saturday</i>: Exploring! I love exploring :). The next morning, I woke up early to get ready to go caving/spelunking at Lusk Caves. On the particular morning, Marc decided to bail out on me b/c of a sore back, but I guess it all worked out anyhow b/c Danny drove 6 of us there in his van (Me, Ange, Adrian, Alice, Dawn, and J) . The driving and walking distance is further than I expected but it was all worth it :). The hike up seemed to take forever, but because we followed the road instead of the trails down, it saved a lot of time. But, I think next time, we should plan to spend at least 6 hours, if not more, for the entire trip.<br />
I&#8217;d like to say something about their maps tho&#8217;&#8211;they&#8217;re not very good; especially the ones that lead to the entrance of the caves. We first stumbled upon the exit of the caves and if I had not seen the hidden sign explaining that the entrance was 100 metres away, we&#8217;d wouldn&#8217;t have known to venture further. Along the way, there was another sign and &#8220;mini entrance&#8221; to the caves but upon investigation, the &#8220;you are here&#8221; marked the latter part of the caves. However, as Dawn led the way, it seemed that we lost the trail and did not find the entrance afterall but instead, entered midway (which we thought was the entrance b/c nobody really read the sign thoroughly enuff). The stangest thing is that the entrance that we entered in, there really wasn&#8217;t any exit on the left of us.  I think that if we had read this article from the Ottawa Citizen, we&#8217;d been better prepared on what to expect and what to look out for&#8230;speaking of looking out, we saw a deer in the bushes w/in walking distance on the way up as well&#8230;<br />
Our journey w.in took approximately 25-35 mins with time for pics (ange&#8217;s camera, which thankfully didn&#8217;t get wet :P). Ange&#8217;s advice to bring flashlights and wear swimwear neath clothing really helped b/c although the water at mouth of the open caves were only ankle deep and natural light let through, eventually the caves were pitch black and water went to the knees, past the waist, and at the very last stretch (exit), the water was chin high. I almost freaked out when the &#8220;ceiling&#8221;/overhang ended up to be very low and the water very high b&#8217;c adrian or j went ahead and warned everyone that they might haveta submerge under water to pass the crevice (as I cannot swim). With the help of &#8220;finger holds&#8221; (rocks sticking out), moving through the caves was a lot easier. As I waded slowly through the water, I was fortunate that I was short b/c my head fit under the overhang perfectly w/o me having to duck or anything :). However, at one pt, I was so certain that I wasn&#8217;t gonna make it b/c the water was just sooo cold against my upper body. Felt like I was gonna get hypothermia, but we all survived &#8216;tho I hit my head really hard against the marble stone (yeah, it&#8217;s marble!) upon exiting <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f610.png" alt="😐" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> . Thankfully, it was just at the exit of the cave (tho I&#8217;m certain that there were also deep areas of water in the part that we failed to xplore). Another thing to thank God for: the sunshine that day really helped us to dry off and keep warm as we treked back towards the car all in one piece, arriving at OCAC in time for dinner and JAM. I wanna go again! =).<br />
<i>Sunday</i>: As the guys and the other girls played volleyball (J and ange swam too) on the beach (mooney&#8217;s bay), Elaina and I opted to sit out and just talk. I didn&#8217;t realise how much in common we have until yesterday. I actually didn&#8217;t really get to know her til this year, even tho I&#8217;ve seen her last year at OCAC and occasionally ICQed her over the year about VCBC ppl. I really enjoyed our time laughing and sharing our opinions about certain things :). It&#8217;s no wonder that ppl think that she looks like my sister. =P As a bystander, I ended up taking some <a href="http://community.webshots.com/album/37405550MsDxQw" target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer">pix</a> of the game they had and i really like some of the shots&#8230;I haven&#8217;t had a chance to edit the videos but I&#8217;ll do that and upload them eventually :).		</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				I think that my field visits to the <a href="http://www.byward-market.com/" target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer">Market</a> is something I look forward to b/c of the crowds of ppl and the many things to look at..however, it tends to tempt me into buying. oddly, not clothes, but FOOD =). The smells of bread baking and the sounds of preparing various foods and drinks just makes me wanna eat. Tha&#8217;s kinda how I ended up munchin&#8217; down a gelato (piccolo grande: was there for a fv), a homemade ice cream (see previous entry), and purchased some interesting mustard (Wasabi lime) for Marcy. I have yet to enjoy a <a href="http://www.beavertailsinc.com/" target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer">beavertail</a> <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>
Aiya, my cheapest textbook for next school term is $50. The most xpensive one is $121.95 =(. I hope to find some at Chapter&#8217;s so maybe then I can take advantage and purchase the 10% off card <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Speaking of textbooks, I ended up in Place D&#8217;Orlèans yesterday to purchase some essentials from Wal-mart and ended up shopping around. Gap seems to be having an incredible sale (25% off of already sale items), and Coles has a final clearance on &#8220;As is&#8221; books. I ended up purchasing a txtbook called <i>Writing Software Documentation</i> by the same publishers as my previous textbook <i>Designing Visual Language</i> that I bought new at UW for $70.95. The funniest thing is that the Software Documentation one is a literal bounded photocopy of the real book; I brought it to the counter and asked the girl, &#8220;Is this a real/legit book?&#8221; She said it prolly is but couldn&#8217;t really tell me. But anyhow, I bought it anyway b/c I found better condition one for $9.99 (and asked for the $7.99 price b/c there was another one which was in a &#8220;worser&#8221; shape) ;). Hope this book would be a good reference for my course next term as well as for my future career :).
</p>
<p>
In the process, I also ended up at Grand and Toy to look through their clearance items as well and found myself buying another Pentel (tho Sanford/Uniball is betta) gel hybrid pen for my note-taking classes next term for $0.50. And an accessory keychain for my bag (retails for $7.99; got it for $1.99); I think it&#8217;s cute :D.
</p>
<p>
Oh! I almost forgot to mention how my work day ended at the Market today. I remembered that <a href="http://bassman_4f.blogspot.com" target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer">Jon</a> has this nasty lookin&#8217; rash from gettin&#8217; henna the other day, so I asked one of the booths (George Street and ByWard Market Sq.) what was in their ingredients. The henna guy was very informative and told me about the risks of chemicals in so-called henna, which produce side-effects including rashes (from chemical burns) and to the extremes, liver infection. If any stand advertise that it would stay for more than 10 days, it&#8217;s likely to contain PPD, a chemical that&#8217;s used in hair dyes (clue: &#8220;black henna&#8221;). Here&#8217;s an excerpt from an e-mail I sent out to my fellowship which refers one to the <a href="http://www.hennapage.com/henna/ppd/index.html" target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer">henna website</a>.
</p>
<p>
I have pulled the following off a similar website:
</p>
<p>
If you have received &#8220;black henna&#8221; and experience oozing sores, itching, blistering or rashes anytime up to 4 weeks after application, you probably have a PPD chemical burn! Do not try to treat it yourself. This is a serious chemical burn from a toxin, not an allergic reaction, and must be attended to professionally.
</p>
<p>
If a person has a reaction to traditional henna (just mild itching, not raised oozing blisters and scars), it is usually because of a sensitivity to the clove oil, mehlabiya oil, henna oil, or eucalyptus oil which were added to the mix. A person with sensitive skin should ask for traditional henna with only lemon juice added.
</p>
<p>
PS. As per Howie&#8217;s request, I have posted his <a href="http://integrityandhonor.blogspot.com" target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer">new blog</a> in my blog list. Welcome to the community Howard! :).<br />
Oh! and to follow up on the Chinese article that I posted the other day on Willis&#8217; death, here&#8217;s the <a href="http://www.thestar.com/NASApp/cs/ContentServer?pagename=thestar/Layout/Article_Type1&#038;c=Article&#038;cid=1026143376582&#038;call_page=TS_GTA&#038;call_pageid=968350130169&#038;call_pagepath=GTA/News&#038;col=969483202845" target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer">English version</a> as found in the Toronto Star. Please continue to pray for his family and the ones affected.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				<a href="http://www.bulletin.uwaterloo.ca/2002/jun/28fr.html" target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer">UW Bulletin</a> (Friday, June 29, 2002): <i>Willis Au, a second-year civil engineering student, died Sunday evening in Toronto, his home city. Visitation is this Saturday at 10 a.m., followed by the funeral at 11 a.m., at the Toronto Chinese Mennonite Church, 1038 Woodbine Avenue (corner of Danforth).</i> I feel that God&#8217;s name was indeed lifted up and proclaimed that day after reading Pork&#8217;s Sunday, June 30th entry. And from the sounds of it, the funeral and burial service went as well as it could&#8217;ve for such an occasion.<br />
Saturday: Spent afternoon at the Mud Oven w Marcy. I d/n realise that figuring out a design an then painting it would be harder than I thought it is&#8230;evenin&#8217; w Josh and Marc for Starbucks Fraps and dinner (tho J d/n eat) at Shawarma King on Bank St. City-wide P&amp;W @ the Met (better this time b/c corporate prayer instead of groups), and more food w Hilman and Jon at Shawarma King yet again.<br />
Sunday: helped Jon move into his new AC place and had dinner there. So tiring.<br />
Monday: Canada Day. No wonder my feet really really hurt today at work. I was walking all day and was up at 7:32 AM. Marc called to wake me up and I ended up spending half of my day w Marc and his family downtown. I realised that it was my first time w his family doing smthing outside of the house. Actually, we ended up eating at 2 of the places that Marc told me to try, one of which was Eggspectation (eggstravagent, eggpensive, and eggcellent food =P). Walked to Parliament Hill to see horse dung everywhere and ppl stepping IN them. Actually, that was more of a result from the RCMP parade/musical ride thingy. Poor Simon, he was stuck in 43C (w humidex) weather as a guard for the changing of the guard ceremony. Saw some red &#8216;chuters jump from planes.<br />
Afterwards, we decided to venture into the <a href="http://www.nac-cna.ca/" target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer">NAC</a> to cool off from the heat and watched this <em>yawn</em> dance performance by the NAC School of Dance. Normally, I enjoy watching ballets and contemporary dances (drimes, hip hop, etc.), but I donno whether this collection was supposed to show off the talent of its students or not? In btwn, we caught a glimpse of the snowbirds flying in formation.<br />
Subway for lunch. I&#8217;m starting to get sick of these subs, but at least they still have enuff hot subs and bread/toppings/dressings to choose from and they sure taste betta than McD&#8217;s :). Headed twd Major Hill&#8217;s park in hopes for me to get the new Cdn quarter, which is in circulation til September 2002, but the line was insanely long and it was insanely hot, so we ended up at the National Arts Gallery to cool down. We ventured into the Garden Court area and bumped into  J and Ange. So, we just vegged there for hrs upon end while we waited for ppl to show: napping, talking, goofin&#8217; off, and playin&#8217; cards. Frankly, I&#8217;m surprised that security didn&#8217;t kick us out.<br />
Adrian and Chris, Cyn, Ben chan finally decided to arrive so we headed to Imperial Palace (that&#8217;s the second place to eat as recommended by Marcy&#8211;aside from Eggspectation). The Chinese food there is pretty good =). Unsurprisingly, the Chinese menu has a lot more &#8220;good&#8221; choices than the English one. Thankfully, I was able to read some of the dishes and some of us ended up trying &#8220;Toong Choy&#8221; (aka oong choy). Yay! Oong choy is in season =)&#8211;I&#8217;ll remember that next time I go to MK :P.<br />
Firewrks started at 10:05 pm and we all crwded on Major Hill&#8217;s Park. The rest of the other guys (Dom, J, Ange, Tim Poon, Deb, Scott Yee, Andy, Matt, Hilman, Dawn, etc.) were at Parliment Hill. While waiting, Adrian and I walked around and we ended up seeing these 3 guys making music (imitiation all types of sound) all w their vocal chords. Neat eh? :). Ange later told me that they missed 25% of it b&#8217;c of the buildings, so I&#8217;m rather glad that we (Chris, Ben Chan, Marc, Jon, Bert, Adrian, Cyn, and later Elaina and Ben Hu, didn&#8217;t take Dawn&#8217;s advice to join them at the Hill. Took advantage of my slower shutter speed on my dig cam and took some pix. Unfortunately, my hands naturally shake, so mine didn&#8217;t turn out too well, but the couple that Marcy took on my cam were okay :). All in all, the fireworks were definitely worth it! Yaay! Tho&#8217; I missed them last year, I got to see them this year. My cos claims that they heard the resonance of the big ones even in Gloucester-Ottawa area! One observation tho: July 1 seems to be a very odd day: Yesterday was super hot (43C w humidex: hottest of entire summer thus far aside from today), and last year was the coldest (6C).<br />
I neglected to mention the three brats that kicked my bag around and got it dirty. Basically, we were in an area of space and our bags were on the floor (decorated w sidewalk chalk in front of us by the fence so basically our bodies surrounded the bags). As the fireworks were about to start, 3 kids (7-11 year olds?) pushed their way in and stood in front of us. Elaina and I gave each other looks and kinda said, &#8220;what the heck?!&#8221; in Chinese. I was gonna shrug it off but then they started to kick our bags around. Cyn askd them to be careful of our stuff, but they still walked all over our stuff. I wasn&#8217;t too pleased and started talking behind their backs in Chinese. Elaina, tho, bascially said everything in English, asking to watch where they stepped. The oldest daughter proceeded to talk back and say, &#8220;well, your bags shouldn&#8217;t be on the floor to begin with. You should watch where you put your things&#8221;.  If I&#8217;d known who their parents were, I would&#8217;ve gave the parents a piece of my mind. First, discipline your kids. Secondly, teach them some manners. They talk back, are rude, and very inconsiderate. Not only did they not say, &#8220;Excuse me&#8221; (cept when they tried to go out and we didn&#8217;t really let them) or apologise, as the boys left their spots, the girl tried to hog her body across the &#8220;empty&#8221; space. Anyhow, I felt that last year&#8217;s Veggie Tales keeners were a lot more tolerable than these kids. Elaina ended up saying that she was tempted to not have kids because of these people. heheh. I persuaded her to teach her kids well if she ever ends up having them ;P.		</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				Only 3 days has passed since the week has started and I have<br />
        already begun to develop a mild case of amnesia. I shall try to recollect<br />
        every significant event. However, I&#8217;m in no way saying that the others<br />
        are not highlights of my days either.</p>
<p> Sunday: Started the season/month with an afternoon of blading @ Riverside<br />
          w Matt/Marcy/J (bike). I almost forgot how to blade but I&#8217;m glad there<br />
          were no accidents. My wheels are terribly slow. They ended up giving<br />
          me a &#8220;5 min&#8221; head start on our return trip and it seemed like they took<br />
          no time in catching up! Well, i still can&#8217;t stop very well&#8230;but next<br />
          to tackle: Rideau River/Canal Pathway.
        </p>
<p> Strolled to Loblaws to buy some food for BBQ at Howiez, but they didn&#8217;t<br />
          end up eating any of the bread. Ah wellz, it was &#8220;see-lai&#8221;ish cheap<br />
          anyhow: 12 for $1.99 and Matt ended up taking a blueberry cheesecake<br />
          home :). Hilman graciously spent most of his time warming in front of<br />
          the BBQ grill&#8230;and in the process, cooked our food ;P. Many of the<br />
          ppl at Howiez already spent the afternoon playing football and so all<br />
          they ended up doing was veg on the couch to watch the b-ball game on<br />
          TV (sigh, where&#8217;s the fellowship? tho this thought must be from a girlz<br />
          pt of view..). I was extremely bored and was about to leave when luckily,<br />
          a group of people were interested in playing Taboo :). &#8216;Twas fun and<br />
          Lil tied the game by getting beeped last.
        </p>
<p> Monday: er, met up w Marc at Carleton&#8211;walked around d/t and into<br />
          the Contemporary Museum of Photography (no wonder it&#8217;s free admission),<br />
          and ate at Coaster&#8217;s (on top of Fish Market in Byward Market) for all-you-can-eat<br />
          mussels at $8.99 (everyday). There&#8217;s also all-you-can-eat lobster @<br />
          $24.95, but through the course of my meal, I heard 2 complaints from<br />
          2 diff tables that the lobster was overcooked. However, the mussels<br />
          are only seasoned one way, instead of at Crèpes de France, which is<br />
          now $12.95 (Tues) for choice of 3 different seasonings. &#8216;Twas very filling.<br />
          I had close to 4 plates of mussels&#8230;I think I&#8217;m getting fat or will<br />
          soon&#8230; =|
        </p>
<p> Tuesday: Woken up by a phone call at 9:00 am. The Ministry of Labour<br />
          was calling to offer me a position. I had mixed feelings so I ended<br />
          up asking if I could think it over b/c I was still waiting on news from<br />
          TO (tho that one I can stay in Ottawa ;P). They only gave me til the<br />
          end of the work day to reply, so bascially, I couldn&#8217;t reach the person<br />
          in TO in time, so I&#8217;m praying that the other one will wrk out as well<br />
          w flex hrs (in TO) so that I can expand in my experience with HTML/CSS.<br />
          Although this Ottawa job will be the most humbling experience in my<br />
          entire career history and my high school years (b/c of the salary: minimum<br />
          wage at $6.85! Even B.C.&#8217;s min wage is $7.50 now!), I think the experience<br />
          in the government will really be valuable and this sounds like a fun<br />
          job b/c we&#8217;ll be able to interact with many people in the workforce<br />
          (public sector) and we get to drive the Ministry car :P. Pray that we&#8217;ll<br />
          all be safe when the team members are driving :). I guess this job is<br />
          an answer from God. I didn&#8217;t really pray that I&#8217;d get this job, but<br />
          rather I left it up to God (b/c secretly, I didn&#8217;t really know what<br />
          to think of it&#8211;the min wage factor is really discouragin&#8217;). Now that<br />
          I have it, I think it&#8217;s neat that this job works out perfectly with<br />
          my vacation schedule. I&#8217;m scheduled to fly home in about 10 weeks and<br />
          my job ends around then as well :).
        </p>
<p> What I don&#8217;t understand is WHY I have so many potentially &#8220;better&#8221;<br />
          job offers (salary wise, and related-to-field-wise) lined up now that<br />
          I have a job? The one in TO I&#8217;m really praying to get, and today before<br />
          I called to accept the job offer w the gov&#8217;t (after applying to another<br />
          online application yesterday), I suddenly receive a call for an interview<br />
          for a database job (IT: $12/hr), which I did not expect to receive a<br />
          call from at all. However, the guy told me today that it is 10 wks in<br />
          length&#8211;but it&#8217;s starting earliest on Jun 17th, which is 1 wk too late<br />
          for me (b/c of my flight plans). At that time, I was in a mall (ended<br />
          up there for 6 hrs :{ and left empty-handed but I didn&#8217;t intend to shop<br />
          in the first place; ended up at Sunglass Hut chattin&#8217; w Jon and tryin&#8217;<br />
          out a billion shades) so I didn&#8217;t really think about my schedule&#8211;I<br />
          gotta remember to call tomolo to cancel my interview fer next week.
        </p>
<p> Because Marc bought 2 DVD&#8217;s at HMV, we went home to watch <i>The Corrupter</i>.<br />
          Tho&#8217; I didn&#8217;t get who the corrupter was&#8230;Chow Yun Fat? At least the<br />
          Chinese in this one is way better than <i>The Art of War</i>&#8230;This<br />
          is my last week of having all the free time in the world to do anything<br />
          before wrk begins. I hope I don&#8217;t waste it <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f61b.png" alt="😛" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				Last post of the month&#8230;another May has drawn to a close&#8230;another<br />
        month of being unemployed&#8230;and to top off the week of movies, JJ and<br />
        M virtually dragged me by my feet to see Star Wars Eps II yesterday. After<br />
        sitting in the theatre and looking at my watch for X num of times (2hr<br />
        30 min), I got outta my seat and shrugged the over-hyped movie off my<br />
        shoulders. I didn&#8217;t get most of the plot and well, there wasn&#8217;t really<br />
        much plot to tell you the truth; it felt like an over-extended TV show.<br />
        I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m up for seeing the rest of the Star Wars eps&#8230;(yes,<br />
        this was the first one I had to endure through from start to finish).<br />
        The changing from scene to scene (til about the end) slide-transition<br />
        technique was so &#8220;Jetsons/Flinstones&#8221; or 80&#8217;s like&#8230;and the cheeese&#8230;I<br />
        didn&#8217;t think that the actors were very well chosen..and Natalie Portman,<br />
        she&#8217;s not as &#8220;cute&#8221; as most people make her out to be&#8230;&#8217;course, I may<br />
        be wrong&#8230;</p>
<p> We enjoyed lunch earlier that day at Blue Cactus. I&#8217;ve never been<br />
          there before but the prices are about downtown/Byward Market-ish. The<br />
          atmosphere is quite nice and the food, aside from the small portions,<br />
          is quite presentable&#8211;tho the chicken was a bit dry, but the salad was<br />
          yummy. While the two fellows droned on and on about cars, I just sat<br />
          in silence and ate my lunch and finished before the two of them. That<br />
          was a first. =9 We walked halfway acroos Rideau Centre before J realises<br />
          that he forgot his phone and shades at the restaurant, so we saunter<br />
          back to retrieve them <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f61b.png" alt="😛" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

<p>
Finished reading 4th book of H.P.; kinda gets foreboding after awhile&#8230;unlike Nancy Drew/Hardy Boys mysteries. What kind of youth/juvenile fiction is H.P. categorised under? Horror? Mystery? Also finished <i>A Hundred Secret Senses</i> by Amy Tan. Working on <i>Sophie&#8217;s World</i> soon.
</p>

Yesterday, Marcy and I went to the Aviation Museum. The planes were pretty cool. There was this one big plane (Lancaster says Marcy) where one gunner sits at the tail of the plane. Boy, do I ever feel sorry for the guy who hadta sit there. One can&#8217;t really defend himself in a flyin&#8217; battle. He&#8217;s pretty much good as dead if any bullets are aimed at the tail of the plane.
</p>

Today, I ended up tutoring my cos in Chinese again, and took my other cos to her first soccer game for the season. We were able to bike there, so it was fun :). I haven&#8217;t biked in awhile; ever since I returnd the bike to my friend last year. They won 1-0, but it was funny b/c she didn&#8217;t even know they had even scored (she was subbing off for that goal). Meanwhile, I froze my butt off b/c I was only wearing a T, and a light jacket and sat there for 1 hr. Tho&#8217; she went home only in shorts and jersey. I didn&#8217;t realise it was gonna be that cold, else I would&#8217;ve brought a jacket fer her too (her mom might&#8217;ve been disappointed in me in that regard). :{  I think twas as cold as last year&#8217;s Canada Day. Currently, w windchill, it&#8217;s -4C! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f641.png" alt="🙁" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

				<description><![CDATA[Wow, @ this time last year, I was rock climbing and enjoying the lovely WARM and SUNNY weather of Ottawa. What happened?! I&#8217;m still freezing my butt off and strangely enuff, as I was reading back at what I was doing during the same week/end, I noticed that I caught a similar cold on the exact day(s). The symptoms were similar and everything! First itchy throat, then cough, then sniffles and runny nose (and urges to sneeze now). Some have suggested that it&#8217;s allergies. Ah non! I can&#8217;t possibly be developing allergies at this age and with such progessive symptoms?!…]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				Wow, @ this time last year, I was rock climbing and enjoying the lovely WARM and SUNNY weather of Ottawa. What happened?! I&#8217;m still freezing my butt off and strangely enuff, as I was reading back at what I was doing during the same week/end, I noticed that I caught a similar cold on the <i>exact</i> day(s). The symptoms were similar and everything! First itchy throat, then cough, then sniffles and runny nose (and urges to sneeze now). Some have suggested that it&#8217;s allergies. Ah non! I can&#8217;t possibly be developing allergies at this age and with such progessive symptoms?!</p>
<p>
Went to the library again today. All the books I wanted were <i>still</i> signed out so I borrowed two books from Francine Rivers that I haven&#8217;t read yet. I hope they&#8217;re good, but she usually writes well (Christian fiction for mostly women readers).
</p>
<p>
Spent evening @ Marc&#8217;s playing Chinese Checkers (the &#8220;true&#8221; way), and Scrabble to which I ended up frustrating him with my combination and placement of letters to form words.
</p>
<p>
The sermons today were both really good. Rev. Joseph Lee came to speak to the English side and surprisingly, I can&#8217;t remember what he talked about&#8230;cept for the vague retellings of testimonies of the church in Guatemala. The one I remembered most was Auntie Helen&#8217;s (Lee&#8217;s wife) sermon. She preached on reconciliation and living a Christian testimony w/o words (ie. lifestyle evangelism) to the Chinese congregation. One reason I remembered it was because many of her anecdotes I could identify with, and she impressed upon me that her family is really tight, respects, and loves each other. Another reason why I was so eager to hear Auntie Helen speak is because I know that my mom knows her and because she&#8217;s my youth pastor&#8217;s (from BAC) real auntie (she kinda looks like Auntie Helen in some ways). Actually, my mom just told me that they useta be in the same choir together back before my mom was married at VCAC (&#8217;70s?). The last reason is because I know she&#8217;s a very dynamic speaker. If at least 3 or more people at KW blogged about what Auntie Helen&#8217;s sermon was about last week at KWCAC, I knew that she was worth hearing, even if it was IN Cantonese. I somewhat expected a sermon on reconciliation since she talked about it at JMC as well this year, and at KW last week, but it never REALLY occured to me until I read the English translation of 2 Corinthians 5:17-20. I had no idea what &#8220;wor ho&#8221; was until past mid-way of the sermon&#8230;when all of a sudden it dawned on me that it meant &#8220;reconcile&#8221;!
</p>
<p>
Tho&#8217; I would&#8217;ve prolly never checked out the Chinese side of OCAC if it wasn&#8217;t for Auntie Helen. I kinda felt that I stood out, kept lookin&#8217; around to see if I stuck out like a sore thumb or not and if ppl noticed that I wasn&#8217;t quite as Chinese as they were. Not only does an organ bug me in a non-Cathedral/wedding setting, the hymns they sang I didn&#8217;t know. Both BAC and KWCAC have slowly transitioned towards singing the newer Chinese contemporary praise and worship songs now, which I prefer a lot more. :). So, if anyone really paid much attention, for all the words that were new (tho not too too many which I&#8217;m thankful of :P), I just kinda stopped singing :D. The really really odd thing was that this lady (OCAC member I believe) beside me (her name escapes me), thought that my name was Grace and said that she hasn&#8217;t seen me in service for a very long time now. I told her my name and that I&#8217;ve only arrived for a month. I guess it&#8217;s encouraging that some people notice who&#8217;s new and all..:P Tho&#8217; I wonder who Grace is&#8230;
</p>
<p>
Note: <i>Whipped</i> is not worth watching. Can&#8217;t see the humour. Perhaps I&#8217;m not a guy, but hey, after watching this, I&#8217;m glad I&#8217;m not. Sadly enough, this movie reminds me of some people I know. Slot it in same category as AP (<i>Austin Powers, American Pie</i>) and <i>There&#8217;s Something About Mary</i>.</p>
