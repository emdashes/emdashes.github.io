								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				<![CDATA[When I <a href="http://her.happyhippos.ca/2017/07/first-solo-trip-with-two/">went to Vancouver last year with two little ones</a>, I wanted to minimize the amount of gear I needed to carry. Thankfully my sister&#8217;s kids are the same size, so I was able to limit my luggage to just a carry-on suitcase, a backpack (with snacks and activities), one car seat, and a diaper bag. I didn&#8217;t have to take a car seat with me, but I decided that having one on board would be safer and better overall, so I had to find a way to lug it without needing to carry it.


<h2>The suitcase stroller</h2>


I looked online for ideas, and saw a couple of products to help mitigate this problem &#8211; one was a foldable trolley where you put the car seat (and child in) and the other was a strap that looked like a T where it attached the car seat to a carry-on suitcase. Well, I didn&#8217;t want to buy anything that was only useful in this situation or bring along anything extra (like the trolley), so I tried to use what I had to mimic the T-strap. A mom in a local mom&#8217;s Facebook group asked me to post some screens of my setup when she saw a photo of what I did, and j.w wanted to record a video of it, so he did a wonderful job of capturing my explanation, Bean and all:

For those who don&#8217;t want to watch the unedited video, read on for some written instructions.


<h3>Materials</h3>


[caption id="attachment_6504" align="alignright" width="225"]<img class="wp-image-6504 size-medium" src="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/DSC_0154-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300" srcset="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/DSC_0154-225x300.jpg 225w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/DSC_0154-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/DSC_0154-1568x2091.jpg 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" /> What you need before connecting everything together[/caption]
This is what I used &#8211; and what you might need:


<ul>
    

<li><b>An adjustable luggage strap</b>. You might be able to get away without this if the LATCH straps on your car seat are long enough to wrap around to the back of the suitcase; mine cannot. It seems that Asian families back in the day were known to wrap their suitcases with luggage straps (to keep it together and to see it easier on the carousel, maybe?), so it was quite easy for me to find one lying around. I like this particular one because there is a loop in it that the carabiner clips in so it&#8217;s snug and it doesn&#8217;t move. I&#8217;ve also used a bungee cord in a pinch, when I left my luggage strap behind &#8211; but I didn&#8217;t feel it was safe to put a child in it then.</li>


    

<li><b>One carabiner</b>. If it&#8217;s weight supported (such as ones meant for climbing), it&#8217;s probably safer; mine&#8217;s not.</li>


    

<li><b>A key ring</b>, O-ring, or D-ring. You might be able to get away without this if the top tether can clip to the carabiner, but I find it much easier with it. Probably safer if it&#8217;s weight-tested as well. If you get rid of your luggage strap, you would need this so that the LATCH clips can clip/hook onto the ring.</li>


</ul>




<h3>The setup</h3>


[caption id="attachment_6503" align="alignright" width="225"]<img class="wp-image-6503 size-medium" src="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/DSC_0159-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300" srcset="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/DSC_0159-225x300.jpg 225w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/DSC_0159-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/DSC_0159-1568x2091.jpg 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" /> A closer look at what it looks like after everything is connected together[/caption]
A three-step summary:


<ol>
    

<li>Match the back of the car seat against the front of the carry-on suitcase when vertically standing</li>


    

<li>Thread the luggage strap through the car seat where the seat belt would go for a forward-facing set up, and adjust so that car seat is snug against the suitcase. If there are handles on your suitcase, put the luggage strap through them (the video shows the straps are twisted &#8211; try to make sure they&#8217;re flat before continuing).</li>


    

<li>Take the top tether of the car seat and thread it through the handles on top of the suitcase and the handle bar (I pull up the handlebar to make it easier), and hook and clip the tether to the ring, or the carabiner, if you don&#8217;t use a ring. Tighten, tilt, and test it out.</li>


</ol>


With the car seat strapped to the carry-on suitcase, I could either put all my stuff into the seat while Bean helped roll it, or she sat in it and helped hold some stuff, while I wore my 18 month old in a carrier. People looked our way, but I&#8217;m not sure if it&#8217;s because people haven&#8217;t seen others do this, and/or they were thinking what kind of crazy parent would do that. On Air Canada (Dreamliner specifically), I can roll this contraption down the aisle and get to my seat without undoing anything, but it does not fit down the aisle on WestJet or Air Canada Rouge planes &#8211; some will fit down business class but once you get to economy, you will quickly find out it doesn&#8217;t fit so it&#8217;s better just to undo it in the area where parents gate check their strollers and car seats. You will also need to buffer a little more time to take it apart and put it together again as you go through security screening.
Happy travelling!]]&gt;		</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				<![CDATA[I was once a Bath&amp;Body Works fan: I stocked up on their antibacterial foaming hand soap anytime they had a sale (anything for $3 or less for a bottle was considered a deal) because they smelled nice and looked fancy; I also didn't have to pump a lot of soap to get a nice clean feeling on my hands. And yet, each bottle became recycled waste every time it emptied because one soap pump on sale was cheaper than a bottle of soap refill.
Then, I became a parent.
I read about how triclosan, an ingredient in these antibacterial soaps aren't the best choice for little hands, because they kill everything along with other questionable things that are associated with it. It seems like <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2016/09/02/492394717/fda-bans-19-chemicals-used-in-antibacterial-soaps">they&#8217;ve banned this ingredient now, at least in US</a>, which is a good start, and that Bath &amp; Body Works has &#8220;gentle foaming hand soap&#8221; now in its place. And, I started to shift towards more natural products, preferring unscented or <a href="http://her.happyhippos.ca/2017/01/essential-oils-when-less-is-more/">scented with essential oils</a> over added (synthetic) fragrance or parfums.
Eventually, I quit buying from Bath &amp; Body Works and saved the last few bottles once they were empties and have used my own foaming soap since, which is probably a more frugal and more environmentally-friendly alternative. [ref] Glass or stainless steel dispensers is probably best, but I&#8217;ve used plastic without any problems so far (I did toss one when something looked off).[/ref] Interested in making your own?


<h3>Easy as 1-2-3:</h3>


You can follow the many recipes on Google but here&#8217;s my version:


<ol>
    

<li><b>Get some liquid castile soap</b> (<a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/14-uses-for-dr-bronners-soaps-2013-11">like Dr. Bronner&#8217;s</a>) &#8211; the just-under 1L bottles of castile concentrate go on sale sometimes for under $15. If you want, you can buy unscented or scented and skip adding fragrance in later. [ref] just be careful that you don&#8217;t get any of it undiluted in your eye or your face, especially the peppermint one, as it is super concentrated and your eyes will burn and your skin will tingle for a long while &#8211; trust me on this one, I know from experience[/ref]</li>


    

<li><b>Add some soap</b> into an empty foaming dispenser</li>


    

<li><b>Add water</b> &#8211;  I do 1/4 or less of soap and the rest with water. You can experiment with a ratio you like by washing your hands and feeling how clean it is after.</li>


</ol>


<b>Pro tip:</b> I don&#8217;t actually fill up the entire bottle; I rather make the foaming soap solution more frequently to lower chances of having any bacterial growth / residue in a bottle that sits unused. Note that if it sits in a cool area, it may cloud over, which is fine.


<h4>Optional:</h4>




<ul>
    

<li>Use distilled water instead of tap, as I&#8217;ve read that it may keep bacteria and floaties (precipitate as my friend calls it) at bay. I&#8217;ve just used filtered and haven&#8217;t run into any trouble since I switched from tap.</li>


    

<li>For your own custom blend or to add a nice scent, add only <a href="http://her.happyhippos.ca/2017/01/essential-oils-when-less-is-more/">a </a><b><a href="http://her.happyhippos.ca/2017/01/essential-oils-when-less-is-more/">few</a></b><a href="http://her.happyhippos.ca/2017/01/essential-oils-when-less-is-more/"> drops of essential oils</a> (do you research and avoid the ones that may have a risk if you have little ones in your household: rosemary, peppermint, eucalyptus are at the top of my mind to avoid); sweet orange (be careful as acid may react with plastic in the bottles; I haven&#8217;t had that problem) and lavender may be good choices to start.</li>


    

<li>Add a few drops of Vitamin E for moisturizing and to possibly help with extending its shelf life, but Dr. Bronner&#8217;s has tocopherol as an ingredient which some labels will also say Vitamin E as a preservative.</li>


</ul>

On the featured image: Since I don&#8217;t have time to make my bottles fancy with custom labels to show off, perhaps a DIY faucet extender hack will go well with DIY foaming soap? :P]]&gt;		</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				<![CDATA[When we were expecting our first, we were graciously lent a BabyBjörn&nbsp;carrier, where the baby could be carried facing out or in. We didn't know much about babywearing, and Bean didn't really take to the BabyBjörn; I did eventually come across a <a href="https://skeptoid.com/blog/2013/01/25/will-the-babybjorn-endanger-your-infants-health/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">controversial warning</a> to watch out for &#8220;crotch-danglers&#8221; (ie. instead of dangling by their legs, that they&#8217;re supported by a seat or their legs are in a M / froggy style so that they&#8217;re not contributing to <a href="http://www.ikea.com/ca/en/catalog/products/20327709/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hip dysplasia)</a>, so we returned it, since she didn&#8217;t seem to take to it anyway and because I didn&#8217;t want to risk making her <a href="http://hipdysplasia.org/developmental-dysplasia-of-the-hip/infant-signs-and-symptoms/hip-click/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hip-clicks</a> any worse.
Thankfully, that wasn&#8217;t the end of babywearing: a $21 <a href="http://www.mamankangourou.com/en/product/asiatik--mei-tai-type" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hybrid mei dai / stretchy wrap by MamanKangourou</a>&nbsp;seemed to be a good find which ended up working really well for us when she was smaller[ref]minor complaint are the long straps[/ref] &#8211; at that point, I had no idea what the carries were (mei dai / stretchy wrap?) and had never heard of the company, but I enjoyed its coziness / snugglies, the extra neck support, and she enjoyed napping in it especially during Sunday church service, and when she was big enough to fit in a suspected fake[ref]which the company refused to confirm because it wasn&#8217;t purchased from the retailer vs. Sophie the Giraffe&#8217;s company who confirmed that a hand-me-down one was old, but authentic[/ref] ergo hand-me-down without the infant insert, she liked to be carried in that as well &#8211; even into toddlerhood. A friend allow loaned us a linen Sakura Bloom ring sling, but I didn&#8217;t have the heart to use it all that much because of its cost!
Baby #2 might have been neglected in some things for better or worse (#secondbaby), but this time around, I looked into getting a ring sling that wasn&#8217;t crazy expensive and found one on Etsy for $40 after not being able to source any local handmade ones. When it came, it wasn&#8217;t as soft as I expected so it was harder to adjust, but with the help of my chiropractor, she showed me how to use it so that it&#8217;s comfortable for baby or toddler and me; maybe it wasn&#8217;t broken in yet, but now I know that the sling is probably made of duck cloth (one-sided print).
Enter the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/DIYBabywearing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DIY Babywearing</a> Facebook group. I don&#8217;t know how I ended up on there, but I&#8217;ve learned a lot from this community, with one successfully completed project: an Ikea <a href="http://www.ikea.com/ca/en/catalog/products/20327709/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stilfull</a> tablecloth converted to two soft no-sew (but hemmed) ring slings! Had I known about how easy and inexpensive it is to make your own wrap/carrier, I would have done it from the start, and used $15 instead of paying $40 for one. I&#8217;m likely at a <a href="http://wiki.babywearingdiy.com/do/view/Main/WrapCarries" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">base size 5</a> so I can use the Stilfull tablecloth length for size 2 carries and under when I don&#8217;t want to use the rings, including the following front/hip carries:

By the way, I got my weight-tested rings from <a href="http://babywearings.ca" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">babywearings.ca</a>, a partnered Canadian reseller of <a href="http://slingrings.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">slingrings.com</a>, which is pretty much the go-to place to get babywearing rings. They&#8217;re good because of their weight and because they aren&#8217;t welded together so they won&#8217;t risk tearing the fabric or irritating the baby &#8211; my baby used to like gnawing at the rings or sleeping against them. <strong>Currently, they have a 40% off sale too (Code: NovaScotia)</strong>, so it could be anywhere from $4.2 &#8211; $6 for a pair! I found the large rings made the Stilfull fabric easier to adjust, but also less grippy, so a pair of medium rings would probably work better once you&#8217;re used to how it feels.]]&gt;		</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				<![CDATA[Think daiso, dollar store, aliexpress, plus any facebook mama co-ops, all mixed into one site; one that actually has a better mobile experience than a desktop one - that's <a href="http://wish.com">Wish</a> for you.
I came across the Wish site and app through a Facebook advertisement, and was intrigued because the products were similar to what the co-op groups were selling (often from China) and at much lower prices.  So, I googled. Reviews were mixed, with many poor ratings from consumers, but <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/ryanmac/2016/12/07/wish-ceo-compares-shopping-apps-success-to-donald-trumps-victory-confirms-500-million-investment/#4546098793b3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">write-ups on tech</a> and <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/ryanmac/2016/12/07/wish-ceo-compares-shopping-apps-success-to-donald-trumps-victory-confirms-500-million-investment/#4546098793b3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">business sites</a> and <a href="https://www.therecord.com/news-story/7108343-six-uw-grads-have-founded-firms-worth-more-than-1-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mentions in local sites</a> / <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/stories/waterloo-math-alumnus-named-forbes-top-40-under-40" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">UW</a> seemed to be positive in terms of its success and business model. I gave it a chance though because I ended up finding out that the cofounder and co-CEO was a former colleague/MSN Messenger friend from my UW language lab days, with whom I eventually lost touch with after he moved to Toronto[ref]&#8230;because how many &#8220;Danny Zhang&#8221;s are there in the world, and what are the chances? turns out it was the one I knew[/ref] &#8211; I attribute my impulse buy of Yahoo! stocks to his indirect influence (which ended up tanking and then only finally evened out a couple years ago, at which point we promptly sold it) ← this is to say that I trust-ed him. He&#8217;s a super smart/hardworking guy, so I was super excited to learn about this (ad)venture!

[caption id="attachment_5812" align="alignright" width="230"]<img class="wp-image-5812 size-medium" src="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/WhatsApp-Image-2017-06-12-at-1.01.17-PM-e1497404811742-230x300.jpeg" alt="" width="230" height="300" srcset="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/WhatsApp-Image-2017-06-12-at-1.01.17-PM-e1497404811742-230x300.jpeg 230w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/WhatsApp-Image-2017-06-12-at-1.01.17-PM-e1497404811742.jpeg 704w" sizes="(max-width: 230px) 100vw, 230px" /> As seen from a Facebook post in a co-op group based out of Nova Scotia[/caption]


<ol>
    

<li>Refund policy on goods that do not arrive by the promised date. I just learned that <a href="http://bc.ctvnews.ca/delivery-delays-online-customers-waiting-months-for-orders-from-china-1.3441778" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">packages tend to take forever to clear customs in Canada</a> in general and not necessarily because of Wish itself, so it often doesn&#8217;t get delivered until past the expected date &#8211; one of my first packages was delivered within a month to Kitchener, but it stayed in some facility for two months, and then only came after I got my refund. You do need to stay on top of it and open a support ticket to request a refund though. I have received 6 out of 18 items so far before the expected arrival date; the rest have been refunded &#8211; some of which have since arrived while the rest are still missing or in limbo / la-la-land somewhere. My theory is that their algorithm will self-adjust based on when you tell them that you&#8217;ve received an item (after the expected arrival time has passed, it will ask you if you have received it and if so, when), so that eventually, they will estimate a more accurate (and likely more lengthy) shipping time so you don&#8217;t keep getting free goods.</li>


    

<li>Additional discounts  &#8211; it uses the psychology of limited time offers (and limited quantity offers) to persuade you to buy something. For example:


<ul>
    

<li>Group buy pricing &#8211; cheaper if you buy with someone, or if someone buys with you, you get a rebate to be used on your next purchase (by a certain time)</li>


    

<li>Instant offers &#8211; cheaper by a very small amount if you buy it within a set time</li>


    

<li>Promotional pricing &#8211; the more you buy and the more you review, the more points you get towards leveling up. Every time you level up, you get a discount &#8211; which expires after a certain time</li>


    

<li>Cart savings. <strong>Pro-tip:</strong> if you do not need to buy something right away and there is no timed discount offered, leave it in your cart and keep going to your cart and leaving your cart. Some time later, you will be offered an extra 5% off if you buy it right away</li>


    

<li>Spinning the daily discount wheel &#8211; it seems to be based on items you have viewed or have in your cart, discounted for 10 minutes</li>


</ul>


</li>


</ol>


What do you need to watch for?


<ol>
    

<li>Don&#8217;t buy anything you need if you need it by a certain time; if history is a good predictor, it can and will take months &#8211; see first point in the section above.</li>


    

<li>Look at the price &#8211; many times, it advertises &#8220;up to&#8221; a certain % off (either 50% if a referral, or 20%), but I haven&#8217;t actually gotten anything more than 5% off, and I&#8217;m not even sure how to get it up to the advertised discount. Don&#8217;t trust the regular prices &#8211; they&#8217;re over-inflated, and research your prices before buying even with the discounts; sometimes, you can get it locally or elsewhere for about the same price or even lower. And click on the Related section/tab to see if other stores with similar ratings sell it for a lower price. Remember, Wish is not a single store, so if you&#8217;re reading negative comments about products from the Wish site, you need to remember that it&#8217;s likely dependent on the reseller / shop and not Wish itself (similar to Aliexpress, eBay, Amazon).</li>


    

<li>Reviews. My own rule is to read each product&#8217;s reviews and only buy something that is 4 stars or more with the more ratings the better (ie. 100+), unless you are willing to take the risk and throw that money away should it not meet your expectations. You need to pay for shipping if you send back an item, so most often than not, it&#8217;s not worth it, so I don&#8217;t buy big-ticket items.</li>


    

<li>It&#8217;s hard to track down a specific item, unless you know how to search for it; if you are just browsing, it&#8217;s a better shopping experience</li>


    

<li>Clothing sizing is often in Asian sizing. I&#8217;m Asian, so next time I might just go with that because <a href="https://www.wish.com/c/557a85dc8b8cb34ac6ebd5c0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a L dress ended up too big</a> in the bust area despite reviews saying it&#8217;s really small (I&#8217;m a US XS, so I&#8217;m probably 2 sizes up as opposed to 3). I&#8217;ve been trying to avoid buying adult clothing just because you can&#8217;t try it on first, but I find children&#8217;s clothing to be easier to buy as I can always buy larger and hope they will grow into &#8211; that and the price point for children&#8217;s clothing is generally lower.</li>


    

<li>Know that most products are made in China; they may not be the best quality, and you may be getting a product that is like its brand-name counterpart (or counterfeit &#8211; some product rating comments will say that despite the advertised brand, it&#8217;s not the quality they expect from that brand).</li>


    

<li>Support, other than on shipping, seems to be miserable &#8211; you get a different rep at each interaction and the reps sound like they follow a script so response is slow and frustrating. Case in point: I tried to get technical support because the app said I had a discount that would be automatically applied before a certain date, but I tried adding items to my cart and the discount wasn&#8217;t being applied. I did get an email reminder saying that the promo would expire in a few days (before the posted date) so I asked them to send my feedback to the technical team; the Zendesk Help thread is still ongoing.</li>


    

<li>Wish is not just one app / site &#8211; they have a few others focusing on different offerings: geek, home, mama are a few of the segmented branches. However, the user experience is a very disconnected, lacking SSO (single sign on) which means you need to create a separate account for each one and your point and level history starts at 0, despite it selling the same items at the same prices &#8211; for the most part. I have noticed that the separate apps tend to be more experimental first (A/B testing?) &#8211; for example, all items used to have a base cost, with shipping to Canada about $2-$3 for a small package. However, in the separate apps one day, I noticed the same item had $0 cost but the shipping went up by $1-$2; the final total was either the same, or cheaper by $1, so I ordered through the separate app. A few days later, this model was applied on the main site / app (for marketing effectiveness, it does seem that the &#8220;you just need to pay shipping&#8221; model is more enticing than a product that costs money with a lower shipping cost). So my<strong> pro-tip</strong> advice, is that you can look on the other more focused apps / sites if you&#8217;d like, but use the main Wish app / site to buy so you can keep your points in one place (for faster discounts), and you can keep a track of your purchases all in one place.</li>


</ol>


If by now you are as curious as I was about this Wish site, and you haven&#8217;t signed up, download the Wish app (on phone, don&#8217;t sign up via desktop browser), use promo code <em>dpvwsfd</em> to save <em>up to </em>50% off your first purchase &#8211; do let me know if you actually save 50% , because I&#8217;m thinking you&#8217;ll save at most 5%.]]&gt;		</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				<![CDATA[Don't be mistaken: it's not BLIND without the "I" (get it?); it's pronounced "BLEND". I don't remember what it stands for, but it's the intersection of business and design.

I had the opportunity to attend <a href="http://www.blnd.ca/#schedule" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BLND</a>, this one-day, full-day UX event (conference) that was entirely <em>free</em> (even the food was free, and the optional bus from/to UW)! By the end of it, I went home impressed at the quality of the talks, the workshops, and the flow of how they managed to jam-pack a day&#8217;s worth of material. This was also the first event where I felt that there was a good mix of community professionals and students, and  got to hear from various people on how they got onto the UX path. I&#8217;ve come to conclude that no one journey is the same, and reflecting back, mine seems just as accidental[ref]but we all know that nothing in life is accidental, and I don&#8217;t believe in coincidences[/ref] as the many who shared their stories[ref]My story? Two English courses in my program piqued my interest, then interactions with those at work, options to either go UX or PM route, and then to research or design route[/ref]. Though, the path can be so much more directed as a student these days, as there are a multitude of programs in this field!
The workshop I chose to attend covered many tips that would have been quite useful in the large corporate environment where I spent a number of years at as a UX person[ref]at a time where UX roles were relatively new and where job titles weren&#8217;t standard across the company or industry convention, so getting HR to recognize that what I did was on par with other peers in the org was only possible with a supportive manager[/ref], and it was a great complement to the keynote talk which reminded us to embrace &#8220;the villains&#8221; (the naysayers or skeptics). I&#8217;m jotting down the condensed / key notes here as I promised to exchange notes with those who went to the others.


<h2>The Art of Stakeholdering</h2>


Workshop by Chelsea Omel (TELUS), Patrick Bach (TD), Markus Grupp (Indigo) &#8211; all formerly at TELUS&#8217; design team focusing on consumer products
Google found me <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/SDNCanada/a-crash-course-in-the-art-of-stakeholdering-patrick-bach-chelsea-omel-markus-grupp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the slides</a>! [ref]it would also appear that 3 of these talks at the other event were given here as well; here is <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/SDNCanada/scaling-service-design-christine-zoltok" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the third</a>. Guess it&#8217;s no surprise that one of the planners of the SDNCanada event was the event organizer for BLND[/ref]
<strong>Stakeholder:</strong> one who has a stake in the enterprise, and involved in or affected by a course of action, who is going to be impacted by what you&#8217;re putting out. The majority of people will not be the perfect stakeholder.
Always remember: it&#8217;s a two-way relationship.


<h3>Steps</h3>

<h3>Know your actor(s)</h3>

their level of influence &#8211; keeping in mind that driving change or adoption from top-down is much easier than from bottom-up</li>


 	

<li>could fall into one of four quadrants / types:


<ol>
 	

<li><strong>prospect</strong> &#8211; low belief, low in understanding of design</li>


 	

<li><strong>skeptic</strong> &#8211; low belief, high in understanding; may become an obstacle or distraction, being a disruption in meetings, and might even rub off on others and lower the energy</li>


 	

<li><strong>eager beaver</strong> &#8211;  low in understanding but high in belief</li>


 	

<li><strong>champion</strong> &#8211; high in understanding and in belief in design</li>


</ol>


</li>


 	

<li>understand their background or need</li>


 	

<li>building empathy with stakeholders is vital</li>

</ul>


</li>


 	

<li>


<h3>Write the script</h3>




<ul>
 	

<li>language is important: adopt the language of the people / of the organization</li>


 	

<li>Find out what the words mean; define your context</li>


 	

<li>understand your stakeholders;<strong> understand their</strong> <strong>mental models</strong>:
[caption id="attachment_5613" align="alignright" width="300"]<img class="wp-image-5613 size-medium" src="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/wp-1489207063805-e1489210708695-300x65.jpg" alt="notebook notes" width="300" height="65" srcset="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/wp-1489207063805-e1489210708695-300x65.jpg 300w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/wp-1489207063805-e1489210708695-768x167.jpg 768w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/wp-1489207063805-e1489210708695-1024x223.jpg 1024w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/wp-1489207063805-e1489210708695.jpg 1538w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /> Another example above: these are equally valid concepts for the idea of a &#8220;merger&#8221;[/caption]
e.g. the word &#8220;research&#8221; could have different meanings for many people (&#8220;market research&#8221;, &#8220;academically&#8221;, qualitative vs quantitative);
there is a risk of miscommunication when one person has a different mental model than another;
physical mental models (e.g. a house) are easier to illustrate than service experience mental models (e.g. getting your morning coffee/tea)</li>


 	

<li><strong>Group icebreaker idea:</strong> sketch the steps on how each of them would make a cake; how much detail will one insert into a sketch? this helps you to gain insight on what they value and surface assumptions &#8211; where people are at, what they are thinking</li>


 	

<li>Reminder: you might get buy-in into the process, not necessarily into the product / idea, and that could still be considered a &#8220;win&#8221;</li>


</ul>


</li>


 	

<li>


<h3>Set the stage</h3>




<ul>
 	

<li>adapt activities to <em>who</em> is in the room,</li>


 	

<li>workshops: to get people on the same page
types:


<ol>
 	

<li><strong>showing:</strong> for skeptics, prospects; high-production in quality, simple</li>


 	

<li><strong>learning:</strong> for prospect, eager beavers; e.g. Design 101; case-studies, templates, examples to work through together, coaching opportunities such as journey maps, empathy maps</li>


 	

<li><strong>working: </strong>for champions, eager beavers; have clear objectives, advanced tools, and less prep work is usually necessary; the dream state</li>


</ol>


</li>


</ul>


</li>


</ol>


Remember: [embrace failures] sometimes failures can lead to success!


<blockquote>Mastering the art of stakeholdering is what sets you apart</blockquote>


Me: In other words, if I was to assign &#8220;competency&#8221; categories to it (according to HR report cards when it comes to self-assessments and performance reviews), this would be key under influence and persuasion.]]&gt;		</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				<![CDATA[Taken from the archives of my UX blog, started some years ago. Originally posted: October 22, 2010 | Revisited today, as we're using mobile more than ever before.
<a href="http://www.uxwaterloo.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">uxWaterloo</a> is a local group that meets regularly with folks interested in the user experience of products and services. This month, James Wu, a UI Architect, spoke at the meeting about design considerations for mobile experiences. This event particularly interested me, not only because of the topic, but particularly also because the guest speaker is from Kobo, a Canadian (at the time) e-book company (that integrates with Pocket, so you can download and read everything you&#8217;ve saved online offline and without the ads!).
Like many, I have traditionally focused more on web desktop experiences, but I have on occasion needed to design for a mobile experience as well. James eloquently summed up the challenges I have often come across when transitioning to the mobile space, and reminded me of others that aren&#8217;t always thought of, such as:


<h2>Screen Real Estate</h2>




<ul>
    

<li><strong>Screen size</strong> (diagonal space)
For example, a 29&#8243; desktop monitor could be 300-500% bigger than a mobile phone</li>


    

<li><strong>Orientation</strong> &#8211; the changes from portrait and landscape (and vice versa)
What&#8217;s interesting is that during their user research with 1024&#215;600 tablets (such as the Samsung tablet), they observed that users prefered using this size of tablets in landscape format</li>


    

<li><strong>Screen resolution</strong>
Using the same 1024&#215;600 example, you would either have your screen in &#8220;short and wide&#8221; format, or &#8220;narrow and long&#8221;</li>


    

<li><strong>On screen keyboard</strong>
On many touch devices, more than 1/2 the screen is taken up by the keyboard, which would cover anything underneath it</li>


    

<li><strong>Platform variations</strong> (or device / hardware variations)
The takeaway? Design for different experiences/products; don&#8217;t cram everything into one screen if it&#8217;s not necessary. Why? &#8220;Don&#8217;t necessarily think people use their phones the same way as tablets [desktops, etc.].&#8221; James said that at Kobo, they must design knowing that people will have multiple devices; the experience should be consistent across them, but not [necessarily] identical.</li>


</ul>




<h2>Hardware</h2>


Like desktop computers, hardware varies across different models. For the mobile devices, things like processor and memory are important to consider as it could affect battery life, performance, and even result in side effects like heat. Others include:


<ul>
    

<li><strong>Removable storage:</strong> the ability to &#8220;hot swap&#8221; a media card while the application is running in either the background or the foreground could cause undesired effects if designed improperly</li>


    

<li><strong>Interaction mechanisms:</strong> these may effect how a user interacts with an application such as trackballs, trackpads, keyboards, gesture strips (like the Palm Pre)</li>


</ul>


<strong>Gestures</strong>
For touch devices, we get into the a realm that is still pretty new. There is not yet official standards for touch gestures and there is limited documentation to illustrate them (James suggested that Apple may currently have the leading edge).


<ul>
    

<li><strong>Core/standard gestures</strong> like tap, swipe, pinch, expand, drag
For example, a more common gesture is the Pinch-Zoom to adjust the font size of Apple devices</li>


    

<li><strong>Peripheral gestures</strong> may include less familiar gestures such as long press, rotate, shake, sequences
Using Apple again for this example, a less common might be shaking the iPhone to perform the undo action</li>


</ul>


When designing for touch, one must consider gestures could be used in different directions and even with multiple fingers. It isn&#8217;t surprising that some devices even recognize simultaneous touches (imagine designing a piano keyboard app so that multiple keys could be played at once to create a chord).
It&#8217;s also important to provide users with affordances that let them know that features are there, and that they will use. Kobo uses instructional overlays for first-time use, as well as ghosted elements. I tried to imagine what a &#8220;ghosted element&#8221; was based on James&#8217; description and thought of the many mobile games where they use these visual cues to indicate the controls (where to tap on the screen) as a part of the onboarding experience.
Kobo may also add advanced gestures for more advanced users (like a keyboard shortcut on the desktop), such as adding an element of fun by adding a gestural easter egg in the Kobo app.


<h2>User Context</h2>


We must remember that users are likely in different environments and may have more constraints than if they&#8217;re sitting in front of a desktop. Considerations include:


<ul>
    

<li><strong>Mobility:</strong> device may not be plugged in (may impact battery life for example)</li>


    

<li><strong>Divided attention:</strong> users could be multi-tasking or looking at the device on the go
[e.g. using their devices while walking from the train platform to catch the connecting train]</li>


    

<li><strong>Unpredictable surroundings:</strong> things like flakey connections [e.g. online then loses reception while train goes under the tunnel] could impact a download or chat experience</li>


    

<li><strong>Cost:</strong> How much would it cost by running your application? Unfortunately, not everyone has unlimited data. Some customers pay per byte, and that might mean customizing for wifi vs. data</li>


    

<li><strong>Others:</strong> the amount of light (dark environment) or even the number of free hands could impact how they interact with the device.</li>


</ul>


I&#8217;ve observed commuters carrying a briefcase in one hand, newspapers in another, and managed to hold a cup a coffee, along with their device. In that case, could they still perform a multi-touch gesture, and would they still be able to navigate even if they couldn&#8217;t?
Knowing what users are doing while they&#8217;re using your product is a good advantage. Lesson from Kobo: James told us of a time when they hid the notification bar, including the time, to minimize distractions while the user was reading. Yet, it didn&#8217;t occur to them that if a customer didn&#8217;t have a watch or an easy way to check for time, they had to exit out of the application. Now, the notification bar can be brought back with a gesture.


<h2>Standards and Expectations</h2>


Customers might expect applications to be specific to their product. When Kobo designed an app that looked like it was for Apple device, Android customers weren&#8217;t happy. But once they took away the &#8220;Apple&#8221; button and changed the color, they noticed a decrease in complaints about the look of their application.
So when designing for a mobile experience&#8230;
&#8230;these are just some considerations and potential challenges that may come up while designing for a mobile product. Others are shared across the desktop too. We can&#8217;t forget who we&#8217;re designing for, the primary user for your product. For Kobo [at the time], it&#8217;s for women in the mid 30-40s, simply because they found that they spent the most money. Who knows, you might even need to take accessibility concerns as a requirement, simply because it&#8217;s the law.]]&gt;		</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				<![CDATA[Taken from the archives of my UX blog from awhile back.
Originally posted: November 16, 2010 | Revisited today as it's still a good reminder since we're using mobile more so than ever.
I came across a <a href="http://www.lukew.com/presos/preso.asp?26">presentation on mobile design by Luke Wroblewski</a> on the web. I often reference his book <a href="http://rosenfeldmedia.com/books/webforms/info/table_of_contents/"><em>Web Form Design</em></a><em> </em>in my library when designing and reviewing web forms in many of our web applications.
In the presentation, he covered many mobile design considerations, some of which are will be covered in a future post. Here are some specifics:


<h2><strong>Touch Targets</strong></h2>


This is the area where your thumbs or fingers may overlap beyond the target button or control. Some recommendations:


<ul>
    

<li><strong>minimum target size:</strong> 29px wide/44px tall (Apple)</li>


    

<li><strong>recommended touch target size:</strong> 9mm/34px (Windows Phone)</li>


    

<li><strong>minimum touch target size:</strong> 7mm/26px (Windows Phone)</li>


</ul>




<h2><strong>Touch Gestures</strong></h2>


After going through some phone platforms that support multi-touch such as iPhone, Android, Windows, and BlackBerry 6, he groups these as being the common core basic gestures among them:


<ul>
    

<li><strong>Tap:</strong> briefly touch surface with fingertip(s)</li>


    

<li><strong>Double tap:</strong> rapidly touch surface twice with fingertip</li>


    

<li><strong>Drag:</strong> move fingertip(s) over surface without losing contact</li>


    

<li><strong>Flick:</strong> quickly brush surface with fingertip</li>


    

<li><strong>Pinch:</strong> touch surface with two fingers and bring them close together</li>


    

<li><strong>Spread:</strong> touch surface with two (or all) fingers and move them apart</li>


    

<li><strong>Press:</strong> touch surface for an extended period of time</li>


    

<li><strong>Press &amp; tap:</strong> touch surface with one finger and briefly touch surface with a second finger</li>


    

<li><strong>Press &amp; drag:</strong> touch surface with one finger and move second finger over surface without losing contact (using one or both hands)</li>


    

<li><strong>Rotate:</strong> touch surface with two fingers (using one or both hands) and move them in a clockwise or counterclockwise direction</li>


</ul>




<h2><strong>Common system actions</strong></h2>




<ul>
    

<li><strong>Change mode:</strong> press</li>


    

<li><strong>Open:</strong> double tap</li>


    

<li><strong>Select:</strong> tap</li>


    

<li><strong>Delete:</strong> drag (across item or off-screen)</li>


    

<li><strong>Duplicate:</strong> tap (source and destination) &#8211; touch object, then touch elsewhere on surface</li>


    

<li><strong>Move:</strong> drag (and drop) or multi-finger drag &#8211; move one or two to five fingertips over surface without losing contact</li>


    

<li><strong>Pan:</strong> drag hand &#8211;  move fingers and palm of one hand over surface without losing contact</li>


    

<li><strong>Scroll:</strong> drag (one or two fingers): move fingertip over scrollbar without losing contact, move two fingers up/down across surface, or touch scrollbar for extended period of time</li>


    

<li><strong>Scroll fast:</strong> flick &#8211; quickly brush surface with fingertip in the direction you want to scroll</li>


</ul>


LukeW refers to the more complex gestures, that may be unique to specific platforms, as compound or specialized touch gestures.


<h2><strong>Hover</strong></h2>


In this new touch world, you can&#8217;t rely on the &#8220;hover&#8221; action anymore (&#8220;at least not yet,&#8221; he says), and it&#8217;s left up to the designers to find something appropriate in its place &#8211; which I agree with him, hover isn&#8217;t an intentional action; people find information in the hover bubbles accidentally. And yes, there does seem to be a fine line between hover and tooltips.
LukeW&#8217;s advice? Design for mobile first. If you design for a desktop web browser, you may not think of things like the orientation, location input that could impact the UI. From another angle, one could argue that  it&#8217;s probably easier to build it a more complex system (mobile) and remove the unnecessary features (desktop) than vice versa.

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				<![CDATA[The local libraries here aren't your typical traditional ones; sure you can borrow books, but they offer so much more. In addition to having resources like a media centre with a 3D printer and VR games, library patrons can borrow video games, toys, museum passes, and even internet hotspots; they also offer some really interesting programs for different age groups. I'm no stranger to circle time with wee ones, crafting terrariums, breaking out from a mini-escape-room, <a href="http://her.happyhippos.ca/2015/05/coffee-notes/">learning about </a>coffee, or watching new DVD releases in the library&#8217;s little theatre; everything is at and hosted by the library, and the best part is that they are all free! I sometimes wish I had more time or the waitlist to some of these weren&#8217;t so long (like the upcoming social paint nite and refreshments) [ref] this one filled up within 10 mins of open-registration[/ref])!
<span style="font-size: 16px;"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-5592" src="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_20170123_194337-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="739" height="554" srcset="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_20170123_194337-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_20170123_194337-300x225.jpg 300w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_20170123_194337-768x576.jpg 768w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_20170123_194337.jpg 1447w" sizes="(max-width: 739px) 100vw, 739px" />The other night, Ryan Horne from </span><a style="font-size: 16px;" href="https://www.facebook.com/foragergreens/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@ForagerGreens</a><span style="font-size: 16px;"> graciously gave a workshop at the library on how to make kombucha, offered samples of some of his kombucha, and brought everyone a container of starter brew + SCOBY (ready to be added to freshly brewed sweet tea). At the workshop, we found that he sells the starter kit for $20, so we just saved ourselves $20 &#8211; though it&#8217;s really the SCOBY that we&#8217;re after, as everything else we can easily source! Like </span><a style="font-size: 16px;" href="http://her.happyhippos.ca/2014/01/kefir-and-breast-milk/">the kefir</a><span style="font-size: 16px;"> that j.w now makes and drinks (whereby Bean happily drinks plain and gulps down the whey as if it was juice), all one needs is the active ingredient (Kefir &#8211; grains; Kombucha &#8211; SCOBY), and you&#8217;re good to go for awhile.</span>
I don&#8217;t know how my first batch will turn out; it&#8217;s sitting on another counter away from the kefir. If it&#8217;s doing what it&#8217;s supposed to be doing, the tea <del>will turn</del> is turning lighter, almost to a golden hue, as the week progresses, and a new layer of SCOBY <del>will be formed</del> is forming on top. Unlike kefir where you see a distinct separation of the &#8220;curds&#8221; and whey, there seems to be no obvious visual indicator, other than the color and that the SCOBY has formed a layer across / seal &#8211; and only if you&#8217;re paying attention. However, the final indication of both is the taste-test; if you like it, it&#8217;s ready.
Before my notes get all wrinkled and smudged, here&#8217;s what to know about kombucha:


<ul>
    

<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kombucha" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">kombucha</a>, Japanese in origin to mean &#8220;kelp tea&#8221; [ref]makes sense to me, since the stringy yeast on the SCOBY reminds me of kelp / seaweed at times[/ref], now it means fermented (sweet) tea. If you buy a commercial bottle in stores, you could spend anywhere from 3$ to 6$! Essentially, it&#8217;s made up of starter brew+SCOBY+brewed sweet tea.</li>


</ul>




<h2>Starter Brew</h2>


Fully brewed kombucha should smell like vinegar (or a faint smell if it&#8217;s not too strong), and a formula for starter brew comprises of: 1-2 cups of full brewed kombucha (the starter liquid) + SCOBY that is at least 1/8 inch thick (5oz) and should cover at least 1/2 of the surface area / opening of the jar/container/vessel, which is added to 1 gallon brewed tea; the more SCOBY you have, the more likely you will succeed. If you don&#8217;t have starter liquid, you can substitute it for a 1/4 cup of distilled vinegar.


<h2>SCOBY</h2>


What&#8217;s a SCOBY? It stands for Symbiotic Culture of Bacteria and Yeast.


<ul>
    

<li>A healthy one can look like a thin puck and it&#8217;s not unusual to see spits, holes, strands, floaties and strings of yeast[ref]edible, but most people filter it out[/ref]. When you pick it up, it should stay together and shouldn&#8217;t tear easily. A new SCOBY is beige, creamy in colour; the underside will likely look more weird than the top side, and colours of blue or purple aren&#8217;t unusual; it might sink, and that&#8217;s okay. If your container is too small for the SCOBY, it is safe to cut it up.</li>


    

<li>An older SCOBY can turn brown, work slower or stop working, but you can just keep it there in the batch. However, if you see mold on it, just scrap it and start new.   Signs of mold include powdery, dry splotches, specks in black, blue, or white; people have compared it to mold on an orange or a piece of bread.</li>


</ul>




<h2>Brew Environment and Equipment</h2>




<ul>
    

<li>Making an ideal brew: it thrives in 73-85F temperature, out of direct sunlight and avoid an exterior wall if possible. Don&#8217;t fill the container too full: leave some breathing space at the top of the container for the ecosystem to work; it also needs a &#8220;lid&#8221; that breathes such as a paper coffee filter, dish towel, or a piece of paper towel.</li>


    

<li>Food-grade plastic, glass, or stainless steel is okay, despite what online research may say</li>


</ul>




<h2>Brewing Sweet Tea</h2>




<ol>
    

<li>


<h3>Water</h3>




<ul>
    

<li>Must be chlorine-free, clean, potable</li>


    

<li>Avoid minerals &#8211; hard water can slow it down or kill it so if you&#8217;re using tap, boil it first and then let it sit overnight; then reboil it for tea</li>


</ul>


</li>


    

<li>


<h3>Sugar</h3>




<ul>
    

<li>1 cup sugar per 4L / 1 gallon of tea / kombucha. Don&#8217;t worry, 50-80% of the sugar gets converted</li>


    

<li>White is good; evaporated cane juice crystals is the best choice. A bag of Kirkland organic cane sugar is supposedly only $4!</li>


    

<li>If you decided to use honey, he recommends that you get the pasteurized kind because the raw, unpasteurized kind contains anti-bacterial properties, thus may kill it[ref]Jun, is a honey-based kombucha, and <a href="http://www.kombuchabrooklyn.com/blog/jun-honey-based-kombucha/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">using raw honey</a> seems to yield success[/ref]. Honey will result in a faster brew; same with maple syrup, so use less if you use either kind.</li>


    

<li>Do not use artificial or plant sugar (e.g. stevia, agave), as it won&#8217;t work</li>


</ul>


</li>


    

<li>


<h3>Tea</h3>




<ul>
    

<li>Black tea is the best; use bagged or loose</li>


    

<li>Avoid flavoured or herbal teas; any natural oils in them can kill the SCOBY (makes sense since some <a href="http://her.happyhippos.ca/2017/01/essential-oils-when-less-is-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">essential oils</a> have anti-fungal, anti-bacterial properties)</li>


    

<li>Should just stay &#8220;tea&#8221; in the ingredients; decaf is okay</li>


    

<li>Boil 4-5 bags of tea in a 2 gallon pot of water for 15+ minutes; cool it down to lower than body temperature before adding it to the starter brew</li>


</ul>


</li>


</ol>




<h2>Ready State</h2>




<ul>
    

<li>Is the kombucha ready to drink? You can use a straw (and a finger to suck up some tea) for the taste test, or more scientifically, you can also use PH strips to check for the ideal 3.5 PH; a PH of 4.0 is indicative of a new batch, &lt;3.0 is more potent. For a 2 gallon batch, it will start stating like apple cider vinegar around Day 5, and generally, a batch would be ready in about 7-10 days. If you want to slow the process down, you can put the whole thing in the fridge. You can pour it out in a batch and leave some starter brew (batch brew), or add a new batch of freshly brewed tea to the container (continuous brew)</li>


    

<li>When it&#8217;s ready, you can do a secondary fermentation, where you add 10-20% of fruit or other flavours in a bottle of ready kombucha, such as ginger or pear, with or without pulp. Leave it in room temperature for 1-5 days. Sealed will make more carbonation (be careful when opening)</li>


    

<li>You can put it in the fridge to cool it before drinking, or you can drink it straight up.</li>


</ul>




<h2>Clean up</h2>


When washing the jars and other equipment for kombucha, don&#8217;t use antibacterial soap, including on your hand; you can easily use hot water and vinegar to wash and rinse.
ENJOY!]]&gt;		</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				<![CDATA[Because in this case, more becomes too much - for instance, one drop of peppermint essential oil is equivalent to <a href="https://www.google.ca/search?espv=2&amp;q=1+drop+of+peppermint+essential+oils+equivalent+to+28+cups+of+tea&amp;oq=1+drop+of+peppermint+essential+oils+equivalent+to+28+cups+of+tea&amp;gs_l=serp.3...2721.4179.0.4436.3.3.0.0.0.0.99.263.3.3.0....0...1c.1.64.serp..0.0.0.Zs8-hz2zL30" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>28 cups&nbsp;</em>of peppermint tea</a>![ref]though I first read that it was up to 75 bags of peppermint tea![/ref]
In my journey as a mother, it has given me the perfect excuse to move from the mainstream to the more natural (and sometimes more trendy, hip, and thus, expensive) &#8211; away from synthetic dyes, strong-chemical cleaners, parfums and fragrances;&nbsp;now, instead of getting excited for $3 anti-bacterial hand soap from the Bath&amp;Body Works, I get excited over $9 1.1L bottles of Dr. Bronner&#8217;s castile soap, which is pretty much an all-purpose cleaner (for body, face, hands, counters, floors and sinks!). And, I can use a few drops of essential oils to scent it to my fancy &#8211; plus, certain essential oils are said to contain active anti-bacterial, anti-fungal properties, which, if true, then bonus!


<h2>Beginning with Essential Oils</h2>

So where does one start? Had I known more about essential oils before buying my first few vials, I probably would&#8217;ve gotten a few less, or one or two different ones. But, with that being said, I ended up with lemon, citronella, sweet orange, rosemary, spearmint, lavender, ylang ylang (a later addition) and tea tree essential oils.
Now, I&#8217;d recommend one or two from each of these <a href="http://www.deancoleman.org/commonoils.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">three categories</a>, especially if you tend to enjoy experimenting&nbsp;and like to use your own blends instead of an essential oil on its own:


<ul>
    

<li>A &#8220;base&#8221; (grounding) essential oil, such as frankincense, sandalwood, cedarwood &#8211; it looks like I&#8217;m missing this from my collection; I had a broken bottle of frankincense which was lovely while it lasted (during the 1 use).</li>


    

<li>A &#8220;middle&#8221; essential oil, such as lavender or rosemary &#8211; personally, I find lavender to be more versatile than rosemary[ref]especially since rosemary is not recommended for use around younger children from various sources online.[/ref]</li>


    

<li>A &#8220;top&#8221; essential oil, such as sweet orange, lemon, grapefruit, peppermint/spearmint, eucalyptus &#8211; the citrus ones are great in cleaning agents, soaps, but use caution in diffusers as they can erode plastic and as they can affect your skin in sunlight / cause a photosensitive reaction when applied topically [ref]Note that various sources online also recommend against using peppermint and eucalyptus essential oils around younger children.[/ref]</li>


</ul>




<h3>! Precautions and safety, especially around children and pregnant women</h3>


I&#8217;m still learning about essential oils so I&#8217;m far from being an&nbsp;expert in this, but as essential oils are&nbsp;known to actively affect our bodies (it&#8217;s not just nice-smelling), I would follow these precautions, especially around children and pregnant/nursing women:


<ul>
    

<li><strong>Don&#8217;t eat, don&#8217;t apply</strong>: Essential oils are the most potent when ingested&nbsp;and when applied directly on the body especially without any dilution&nbsp;(e.g. with a carrier oil), aka &#8220;neat&#8221;. I would avoid unless under direction and care from a health practitioner</li>


    

<li><strong>Rosemary, Eucalyptus, Peppermint</strong>: based on what I&#8217;ve read online, I would lean towards avoiding these three essential oils around younger children (sources explain that&nbsp;it might affect their breathing), and if you do use it, let it dissipate for 2 hours prior to exposing children in the same area. Though, I&#8217;m still wondering about the commercial products that are advertised as being baby safe that contain these ingredients in them, especially eucalyptus in chest and cold rubs, and germ blends for diffusion (maybe their effectiveness is counteracted by all the other ingredients??)!&nbsp;</li>


    

<li><strong>Pregnancy:</strong> Avoid the use of essential oils in your first trimester of pregnancy; <a href="https://www.westcoastaromatherapy.com/free-information/articles-archive/life-ppasssages/using-essential-oils-during-pregnancy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">research the safe ones</a> for the latter trimesters and nursing if using. Yes, I had exposure to essential oils in massage oils, foaming hand soap, and in commercially available shampoo and handmade (but not homemade) bar soap while I was pregnant and nursing.</li>


    

<li>Use the more common essential oils, unless you&#8217;ve researched the others</li>


    

<li>When in doubt, avoid or look it up&nbsp;online first</li>


    

<li><strong>use on body&nbsp;&gt; in the air&nbsp;&gt; &nbsp;in cleaning products</strong>: essential oils have a shelf life, so once it starts to degrade, instead of using it say&nbsp;as a component of your massage oil, you can add it to your&nbsp;diffuser or into a cleaning agent (e.g the mop bucket) instead</li>


    

<li><strong>Less is more:</strong>&nbsp;unless you use a lot, buying a small vial (10ml instead of 15ml) will ensure freshness. Also, one drop goes a long way even when diluted, as your nose will likely tell you. When diffusing, don&#8217;t let the diffuser go for extended periods of time as you just end up wasting its effectiveness; I&#8217;ve read recommendations of 10 minutes at a time for up to 1-2 hours.</li>


</ul>


You can find more <a href="https://naha.org/?/explore-aromatherapy/safety" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">extensive lists of safety considerations</a> online.


<h2>What can I do with essential oils?</h2>


Now that you have a few bottles of essential oils, here are some ideas on what you can do with them:


<ul>
    

<li>Make your own <a href="https://www.google.ca/search?sourceid=chrome-psyapi2&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=foaming%20hand%20soap%20diy&amp;oq=foaming%20hand%20soap%20diy&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j0l5.3240j0j7" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">foaming hand soap</a></li>


    

<li>Diffuse them with a diffuser</li>


    

<li>Add a <a href="http://her.happyhippos.ca/2014/06/diy-household-cleaners/">few drops to vinegar into a spray bottle for a natural household cleaner</a>, or a few drops of (lemon) essential oil directly to a damp sponge</li>


    

<li>Other ideas include making your own massage oil, <a href="https://www.evernote.com/shard/s313/sh/4a0be947-34b7-4d55-832e-8f2f30665d33/673ad1f143a5f1f17a99539ab46c0859" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">facial cleanser</a>, moisturizer, hair shampoo, sugar or epsom salt hand/body scrub, bubble bath, bum/baby wipes, laundry dryer balls, mosquito repellent &#8211; the possibilities are endless</li>


</ul>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				<![CDATA[When we go on family vacations, I often end up finding myself being our family's "travel agent", so here's a handy list of what I consult when doing travel research or trying to get the best travel deal for my future reference, and for yours, if you end up being your family's travel guy/guide:


<h2>In general</h2>


These are two places I check first for flights and accommodations:


<ul>
    

<li>Google Flights &#8211; use them to get a sense of what the prices are, and where you might be able to find the lowest price if you&#8217;re more flexible with dates
[caption id="attachment_5515" align="alignnone" width="294"]<a href="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/flights.png"><img class="wp-image-5515 size-medium" src="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/flights-294x300.png" alt="Google Flights Flexible Date Chart to find the best price" width="294" height="300" srcset="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/flights-294x300.png 294w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/flights.png 699w" sizes="(max-width: 294px) 100vw, 294px" /></a> To find the price graph or chart, you need to click on the calendar icon in either date field.[/caption]</li>


    

<li>AirBnb</li>


</ul>


If you&#8217;re flexible on time and destination, you can find some pretty great flight deals on <a href="http://forums.redflagdeals.com/hot-deals-f9/?c=5159" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RedFlagDeals</a> or&nbsp;<a href="http://www.yyzdeals.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YYZ Deals</a>&nbsp;/ <a href="http://www.yvrdeals.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YVR Deals</a> (or other Canadian destinations via the parent company,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ydeals.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YDeals</a>)
For ideas of what to do or eat, I like to sign out books from the library or borrow e-books from the library and jot down common suggestions or interesting ideas and go from there.


<h2>Within Canada</h2>




<h3>Flights</h3>




<ul>
    

<li>Pick smaller airports if they&#8217;re similar in distance to your destination and price (e.g. Abbotsford over Vancouver, Kitchener-Waterloo vs. Toronto) as you&#8217;ll likely find cheaper parking, shorter check-in and security lines, and friendlier people</li>


    

<li>Cheaper seats tend to occur between Tuesday and Thursday</li>


    

<li>Check for the prices of flights&nbsp;operated by smaller brands like <a href="http://gonewleaf.ca" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NewLeaf </a>or <a href="http://flyporter.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Porter</a>, and even the sub-brands of major carriers like&nbsp;Air Canada Rouge or Air Canada Jazz. There are charters too like Air Transat or Sunwing, but I generally avoid them due to size and luggage restrictions.</li>


</ul>




<h3>Car Rentals</h3>




<ul>
    

<li>Costco Travel Canada, for Costco members; free second driver if spouse is also a Costco member</li>


    

<li>Priceline &#8211; I haven&#8217;t used them, but my parents have been able to rent a car near the Toronto airport for $10 a day by bidding on a car rental once upon a time.</li>


</ul>




<h3>Accommodations</h3>




<ul>
    

<li>I find there are less listings in Canada on Airbnb.com (likely because it started in SF, CA, so you might find more choices out West vs East), but one good alternative are bed &amp; breakfasts on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bbcanada.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bbcanada.com</a></li>


    

<li>If you&#8217;re travelling to a university town, you can always check their conference center or student residences if it&#8217;s during a quiet time of the year (e.g. summer) for private suites, student apartments, etc.</li>


</ul>




<h2>Canada to/from US</h2>




<h3>Flights</h3>




<ul>
    

<li>Fly from a US city instead of Canada, if it&#8217;s within driving distance; one night&#8217;s sleep and fly package at a hotel (where parking is included when you&#8217;re away) is cheaper than cost of difference in flight</li>


    

<li>Compared to Canada, there seems to be more&nbsp;competition and options in the US:&nbsp;while there are major US-international airlines&nbsp;(United, American Airlines, Delta), we actually prefer the service and price of domestic-only&nbsp;carriers like JetBlue or Southwest; we have not flown ultra-budget airline, Spirit yet, but seat-sale prices are good, even with the price of one checked baggage ($21 per person).</li>


    

<li>Honorable/historic mention: Hipmunk.com, once a SF startup, which provides a more comprehensive view of travel duration, prices on&nbsp;discount sites like Expedia, Travelocity, etc., but to be honest,&nbsp;I don&#8217;t consult it as much&nbsp;anymore now that Google Flight is an option.</li>


</ul>




<h3>Accommodations</h3>




<ul>
    

<li><a href="http://www.airbnb.ca/c/ewong61" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Airbnb</a>&nbsp;(referral link &#8211; $40CAD for first booking)</li>


    

<li>Priceline &#8211; many people have booked via priceline, but if you&#8217;re travelling with more than 2, please note that the fine print says that the price is for two, so I&#8217;m not sure how it works if you plan to travel with more (do you pay the difference? I haven&#8217;t ever tried)</li>


    

<li><a href="https://www.vrbo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VRBO</a> and <a href="https://www.homeaway.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HomeAway</a>&nbsp;&#8211; so I&#8217;m still not clear about&nbsp;the difference between these two sites as they belong to the same company,&nbsp;and they seem to operate similarly to AirBnB but it seems less organized. My sister has booked with them before, for our places in Hawaii.</li>


</ul>




<h3>Car rental</h3>


<a href="https://www.autoslash.com/blog-and-tips/posts/all-about-additional-driver-fees" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Note that certain states cover a second driver for free</a>, and some car rental companies will have free second drivers if they&#8217;re your spouse or if you are a member, for example.


<ul>
    

<li>Costco Travel may have different prices on the US site vs. the Canadian site &#8211; and you need to have separate logins as well; free second driver if spouse is also a Costco member</li>


    

<li><a href="http://autoslash.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Autoslash</a>: we came across this site from Parents magazine &#8211; if you can&#8217;t find a good deal on their site, if you book via another site (like Costco) and send them the confirmation number, it will look for cheaper options until your trip starts. If you end up booking through them, they will automatically cancel and book the same reservation for you if the price drops before your rental starts! I couldn&#8217;t figure out&nbsp;their revenue model so it seemed too good to be true at first, but it worked out great. We found out the hard way that some companies don&#8217;t include fees in the car rental quotes, but this site breaks everything down for you so it&#8217;s WYSIWYG (or pay in this case). You don&#8217;t actually pay until you get to the car rental counter! If you are looking for a specific service, eg. a shuttle to/from the cruise port, you might need to enter a specific location code, which can be found in the car rental fine print when you search for an itinerary OR you can email them to ask which location offers it (they do seem to know!)</li>


</ul>


So, that&#8217;s what we have used in the past&nbsp;&#8211; if you have any links to add to the list / share, please leave a comment!]]&gt;		</p>
