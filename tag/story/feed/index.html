								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				A warm sunny day welcomes the youngster, with her pigtails flying behind as she sprints across the gravelled field and leaps into the seat of a plastic swing. Amongst the others &#8211; the slides, the teeter-totter, and the monkey bars – the swings are her favourite adventure on the playground. The swing takes her beyond the clouds of the earth.</p>
<p>At the top, she sees the flight of the gulls and the ravens flying free and she sees her reflection in their beaded eyes, in her memory past.  Their echoes call to her; taunts that tell her the chains on the swing keep her from being truly free. And yet, she has faith that &#8220;<i>…those who hope in the LORD will renew their strength. They will soar on wings like eagles; they will run and not grow weary, they will walk and not be faint.</i>&#8221; (Isaiah 40:31). She trusts Him; the hands of her Father keep her from falling, keeping her secure while lifting her above the white clouds of the blue sky. Her Father stands behind her, taking her to the level of the eagles, higher than the gulls and the ravens that she sees.</p>
<p>As the swing climbs higher with each pendulum motion, the young girl, my spirit, soars to endless limits. On this swing, with the push of my Father’s outstretched arms, I am able to reach unfathomable possibilities.</p>
<p><i>Written for TalkBAC, June 2004</i></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In spite of the chilly afternoon, a warmth that radiated from within tempted<br />
    me to enter the room. As I stepped beyond the doors into the room, I noticed<br />
    it right away, sitting upon the bare dresser: dead centre. Nothing else surrounded<br />
    this miniature picture frame of gold. One would expect to find a photograph<br />
    of a loved one or of some sort. Yet, to my surprise, in place of the expected,<br />
    all I saw was a black void, a darkness of . . . nothing. <br />
    My eyes diverted its attention from the frame to the marks on the wooden dresser.<br />
    As I peered closely, I noted that the imprints, which led to the edge of the<br />
    dresser, resembled tiny footprints in the sand. It was almost as if someone<br />
    had once walked across the dresser and went on to glance over the edge. I<br />
    was bewildered at the notion such a the thought. My fingers were about to<br />
    trace over the marks when my eyes caught a glint reflecting off the golden<br />
    frame. I looked around the room in puzzlement, wondering how it could have<br />
    happened without a change in angle of the frame&#8217;s position. I continued to<br />
    stare at the empty frame for my eyes were caught in a magnetic force that<br />
    riveted them toward the darkness. With my fingers, I carefully picked it up<br />
    and held it to eye-level. </p>
<p>To my utter amazement, the void of nothingness seemed to shimmer as if it<br />
    was alive. Forcing myself to blink a few times, I cautiously examined it again.<br />
    Indeed, something was truly happening. Almost unnoticeablely, a hazy, gray<br />
    silhouette slowly took form. The outline of a young girl, with sparkling eyes<br />
    of youth and a smile possessing a knowledge that I did not recognize, greeted<br />
    me. She appeared to beckon me and I felt compelled to respond to her strong<br />
    invitation despite my doubts. </p>
<p>My finger hesitantly moved toward the frame and reached out to touch the<br />
    velvet material of the once dark picture. Suddenly, I felt this sensation<br />
    of being yanked into the void beyond my control. This deceiving girl held<br />
    a strength that I lacked. Despite my efforts to take my hand away, my entire<br />
    being was soon engulfed by this darkness. I was the unsuspecting victim that<br />
    fell prey to her bait. The magnetic force pulled me into an unfamiliar realm.<br />
    As I passed from one world into the next, she became free. She flowed into<br />
    my body as I penetrated the separation and released herself from within me<br />
    at the point where my being left the accustomed world completely. I was speechless!<br />
    Unintentionally, I had taken her place. I felt the evil in her; it was so<br />
    strong that it was emitted through the black screen. I began to protest, with<br />
    my lips moving in silence, for sound did not exist any longer. </p>
<p>To my horror, the seemingly beautiful girl picked up the picture frame, and<br />
    hurled it at the window. Instantly, it shattered and I knew that it was over;<br />
    there was no more hope. I was to be forever trapped in the abyss. </p>
<p>
    (Winter 1998) </p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The saying goes, &#8220;Love is blind.&#8221; Well, I declare that beauty blinds<br />
    common sense . . . my, what great fortune! For bestowed before me, on a midsummer&#8217;s<br />
    day, was the loveliest creature that I ever laid my eyes upon-graceful in<br />
    every way, sophisticatedly draped in the reddest of reds. As she inquired<br />
    of the time, her intriguing eyes held mine captive and I could not help but<br />
    ask whither she was destined. She was to be a-ridin&#8217; to &#8220;da &#8216;hood&#8221;-the<br />
    ghettos where her ailing grandmother resided. Most certainly a dangerous place<br />
    for a dame like her to be travelling to alone. Being a gentleman, I kindly<br />
    offered my company. What came next was unexpectedly pleasurable. She seductively<br />
    gave a farewell kiss with a soft declining &#8220;thank-you&#8221; whispered<br />
    in my ear. Would I give so much as to have her! </p>
<p>Oh, the maddening desire in me would not still. Mesmerized, I hastened to<br />
    her grandmother&#8217;s; intensity came over me and I took care of the old lady.<br />
    I slipped into her bed unaware, awaiting. Shortly after, she glided in-her<br />
    face still as she lifted the covers to discover me in her grandmother&#8217;s place.<br />
    &#8220;Darling, come to bed with me!&#8221; Alas, my enticing power could not<br />
    entrance her. Instead, she looked deep into my eyes and remarked, &#8220;What<br />
    big eyes you have indeed!&#8221; Why, certainly all the more to gaze at her<br />
    with. I could control my urges no longer, and forced her . . . Thus, the unfortunate<br />
    fate of Little Red. Would you not agree that all women are trouble? </p>
<p>(Winter 2002) </p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Would you believe that a time ago, hot dogs were one dollar and coca-colas<br />
    were twenty-five cents? I was once again a child, with my hair tied into pigtails<br />
    that bounced whenever I jumped or ran. With my pink T-shirt, yellow shorts,<br />
    and plastic sandals, I ran about in the summer heat catching the rays of the<br />
    sun whilst sprinting through lawn sprinklers that watered the freshly cut<br />
    grass. </p>
<p>One sunny day, after a tiresome afternoon of pure play, my childhood friends<br />
    and I went to a nearby tree. We sat beneath the big branches that shaded us<br />
    from the scorching coming from beams of sunshine. I heard the gentle breeze,<br />
    which whispered through the leaves and through the dancing willows in the<br />
    bubbling brook beyond the woods. As I sat in the comforting shade, I saw that<br />
    the whole world was lazy, like us. The adults were on their porches gossiping<br />
    away while sipping their iced lemonades. Other children held paper fans folded<br />
    in haste by their swift fingers as they played hopscotch and sang skipping<br />
    rope rhymes. </p>
<p>A ringing of bells unexpectedly cut into the summer air, which was filled<br />
    with the warmth of joyous laughter. The faint &#8216;ding-a-ling, ding-ding&#8217; drew<br />
    distinctively nearer. To satisfy my curiosity, I squinted past the bright<br />
    sun and saw the silhouette of a boy, not much older than us, riding a bicycle<br />
    down our street. Behold! What was that he had trailing behind him? At that<br />
    instant, we all knew. Every one of us dashed from under the tree to our parents,<br />
    who were engrossed in their conversations under the porch, to plead for seventy-five<br />
    cents. Interrupting their conversations, I tugged on my father&#8217;s shirt and<br />
    looked at my mother, asking them if they would be willing to give me my allowance<br />
    a week early. I knew I would have to sacrifice whatever sweets I would be<br />
    able to buy with that money, but it would most definitely be worthwhile. </p>
<p>I knew what I wanted. Along with the rest of them, I ran to the bicycle with<br />
    my sandals chanting &#8216;flap-flop-flap-flop&#8217; as it hit the pavement with each<br />
    step. I patiently waited for my turn as five children lined up in front of<br />
    me. Finally, after standing for what seemed like eternity, I did not hesitate<br />
    to give up every penny for what would relieve and refresh me from the heat.<br />
    Of course I chose my favourite flavour, strawberry. I had always loved the<br />
    heavenly taste of sweet strawberries, in a mouthful of cool ice cream, with<br />
    a bite of the crisp waffle cone. Uh-oh, what did the boy say? There was no<br />
    more left! I hung my head with disappointment and began to walk away. With<br />
    much effort on his part however, presumably after feeling sorry for me, he<br />
    was able to gather enough for one last scoop. With my priceless treasure in<br />
    hand, I hastily licked the sides of the cone just as a hint of strawberry<br />
    ice cream began to melt. I could not allow it to drip onto the sidewalk and<br />
    watch it disappear; I needed to savour every taste! </p>
<p>As I slowly walked back into the shade, my eyes were fixed on the waffle<br />
    cone to ensure that the ice cream would not melt in front of me. The boy,<br />
    who sold us the ice cream, had now gone to another street with his &#8216;ring-a-ling&#8217;<br />
    fading into the distance. I climbed the tree trunk and sat in the lowest branch<br />
    with one hand holding onto the waffle cone, and the other, pulling myself<br />
    up and keeping myself steady. I could finally begin to fully enjoy my ice<br />
    cream cone without having to worry about the dreaded enemy, the heat of the<br />
    sun. With my feet swinging from the branches, I carefully brought the yummy<br />
    treat to the corner of my mouth. </p>
<p>To my utter disbelief, with the first lick at the centre of the strawberry<br />
    ice cream, the scoop of ice cream fell out of the cone it rested on, and dropped<br />
    from the tree onto the grass below. Instantly, the grass greedily gulped the<br />
    melted puddle. With my eyes wide, I was left staring at my hand holding a<br />
    waffle cone with a big gaping hole in the middle. Realizing what had just<br />
    happened, I sat there weeping my eyes out at the tragic loss. My heart broke<br />
    in two for my beloved sunshine had melted my cherished ice cream; it had become<br />
    my childhood foe. </p>
<p>(Winter 2000)</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				I was sitting&#8230;well, not exactly sitting. I was in the only position that my potter had moulded me into&#8211;upright. I was positioned in a place on the corner of a chipped, discoloured, and textured wooden dresser. I was constantly fascinated by the ever-so-shiny, reflective, and trusted piece of glass. It was hammered into the wall across the youthful room that brimmed over with joyful and sad memories, yet it also held the ones to come. WHen I peered into that magical glass, it made me look at myself with wonder and awe. AN oddly, yet almost attractive figure with a body full of vibrant colours and designs, was reflected back. Each part of me had be carefully crafted by my creator&#8217;s hand. His handiwork reflected the perfection of his artistry. I was given the opportunity and the privilege by the crator to light up the world with the true colour of brightness. It gave me so much excitement when I realiszed that I had the power to control darkness and to choke it with my presence. What joy I had flooding the room with light!</p>
<p>Yet as time passed, many changes took place within that room. That once so beautiful piece of glass did not glimmer with brightness anymore and a spider crack had been made from a previous accident. The distortions and the reflections made by the scarred corner gradually made me see myself as useless and dull. I had been in the same position for over two years and nobody acknowledged my presence or that I gave the room its brightness anymore. The once encouraging comments fromt he world were replaced by remarks that clearly stated their dislike for my presence. I especially remember the time when they said it right in front of me!</p>
<p>&#8220;That really looks so ugly&#8230;why don&#8217;t you get rid of it?&#8221; asked a friend to the teenager who lived here, while he jerked his head toward me.</p>
<p>
&#8220;Man, I want to, but I can&#8217;t because of my mom,&#8221; the teenager shrugged. He went on to mimic his mother, &#8220;Jesse, don&#8217;t you dare throw that thing away; your aunt gave it to you!&#8221; Curses then flew from his mouth and hit me hard like a slap across the face.&#8221;
</p>
</p>
<p>I realised that his mother didn&#8217;t like me either when she referred to me as a &#8220;thing&#8221;. She only made him keep me due to the fear of what the aunt&#8217;s reaction would be if she found out. So I was trapped in a hole of darkness within myself. How could I shine for the world with brightness when everything seemed so dim?</p>
<p>One night, when half of the world and the sun were asleep, I was staring into the darkness and pondering on why I was created. Before I had a change to really think about it, I was interrupted by a rumble and a slight tremble of the dresser. I had no idea what was happening, so I was really puzzled. It then began to wobble back and forth, which made me dizzy as I gazed around. In the dim, I squinted to watch the surrounding things begin to let gravity yank them away from where they were and they plunged to the cold, hard floor below. I teetered dangerously at the edge of the dresser and finally, had no hope of hanging on any longer. I could not suspend my weight in mid-air for that long.</p>
<p>
&#8220;Aaagh!&#8221; The muffled groans and cries for help from the youth awoke me. I too had been trapped in this mess. Yet, unrealistically, I did not feel any pain, only detachments from different parts of me. I sensed that I could not do anything for this boy any longer for I was broken into pieces. People tried to save the boy, but how could they have in pitch-darkness? They were all lost and they didn&#8217;t know which direction to turn. Darkness had won this time; it had strangled a life.
</p>
</p>
<p>Sitting here again, I reflect back and realise that no matter how I look, or how much people hate me, I have to do my job shining light into the world of darkness. I cannot simply give up and let the darkness smolder everybody. What I see reflecting</p>
<p>Sitting here again, I reflect back and realise that no matter how I look, or how much people hate me, I have to do my job&#8211;shining light into a world of darkness. I cannot simply give up and let the darkness smolder everybody. What I see reflecting back from another mirror are scars, mended cracks that remind me that I have been given another chance to shine for the whole world to see. Mistakes and bad experience have a purpose: you learn from them, growing in wisdom, and you allow them to mold you to who you really are. I am here for only one reason&#8211;to be a light, providing a path of brightness so the world can find its way out of the darkness.</p>

I wouldn&#8217;t have done this if my parents didn&#8217;t get a divorce. Well, let me start at the very beginning.</p>
<p>I am Kristi Zzzyzyton. I live on the coast of Oregon. I am fourteen and I have long, wavy, auburn hair and brown eyes. I wish I had straight, silky hair instead of my wavy, knotted hair. I hate my last name. Who would name someone Zzzyzyton? A lot of people can&#8217;t even pronounce my last name. I&#8217;m not kidding either. Just get a phone book and turn to the last page of the Z&#8217;s. The one before it is even funnier. Their last name is Zzyzzy. Weird huh?</p>
<p>Anyway, that day was a beautiful, sunny day. I was at the beach enjoying the beautiful weather. I tossed my hair and let out a sigh. There was only a week left before school started. I didn&#8217;t want the summer to end so quickly. I enjoyed coming here. I came here today because my parents were at it again; they were arguing once again. &#8220;They just might kill each other,&#8221; I thought as I was sitting on the sand.</p>
<p><b>Chapter 2</b><br />
It was early October. The weather was gray and gloomy. It was a Friday so I got plenty of H.W. That&#8217;s short for homework. School was okay although some of the teachers were difficult but I had made some friends. After school, my friends chatted for awhile and then parted. As I was walking home, I was happy that tomorrow was a Saturday because I could go to the beach again. When I got through the door, I sensed that my parents were up to something.</p>
<p>During dinner, my parents told me that they were going to get a divorce soon. I thought I was hearing things but my mother calmly told me how she and my father just couldn&#8217;t get along anymore. Duh, like I never knew. But I never thought they would get a divorce.</p>
<p>I got up without excusing myself, went into my room and slammed the door. I knew it! It was all my fault. I shouldn&#8217;t have butted in when my parents were busy. I knew I should&#8217;ve listened to my parents and did what they told me to do. If only none of that had happened. If only I could change the past. Now, I was going to the land of &#8220;If Only&#8221; that my friend told me about. I tried to hold back the tears but one escaped and trickled down my cheek. Another argument had started. I could hear my parents through the closed door. They were at it again. I hated them when they were arguing. It had made me angry just thinking about it. &#8220;Adults don&#8217;t fight, only kids do,&#8221; I angrily muttered to no one in particular.</p>
<p><b>Chapter 3</b><br />
The next morning was also a gray and gloomy day. It suited my mood. During breakfast, my parents started to argue about whom I was going to live with after the divorce. I finished my breakfast quickly and went to my room since I didn&#8217;t want to hear another quarrel. I didn&#8217;t feel like going to the beach today. Instead, I watched T.V. and talked on the phone mostly in my room.</p>
<p>That night I decided that I would get out of my parents&#8217; way. &#8220;Then it would probably be more peaceful,&#8221; I thought as I pictured my parents laughing again. I packed some clothes and some other things I needed. I even packed a toothbrush, some toothpaste, and my face cloth. I took all my money that I saved, which was sixty-five dollars, out of my paper-maché pig. I picked up Pooh, my favourite stuffed bear, and put him on top of my knapsack. Pooh was my best friend since I was five. I know that sounds dumb but he is the best listener I know.</p>
<p><b>Chapter 4</b><br />
At 5:30 the next morning, I was awaken by the alarm clock. I didn&#8217;t remember why I had set the alarm until I saw my knapsack by the door with Pooh sitting there. I quickly got up and dressed. I ate breakfast and wrote a note saying that I was sorry for getting in their way and that they didn&#8217;t need to worry anymore. I took my knapsack and headed out the door with Pooh in my arms.</p>
<p>I walked for a few hours not knowing where I was headed for. My stomach started to make funny noises. I glanced at my watch; it was close to lunchtime. I took out a five dollar bill and went to McDonald&#8217;s for lunch. After eating, I headed for the beach because it was a nice and warm day, unlike yesterday.</p>
<p>I walked around the beach and I saw people surfing and swimming. I also saw a cliff and once in a while, a diver would dive off. I asked myself, &#8220;Should I have some fun and jump? Or should I just go up and watch others jump instead?&#8221; I decided to climb to the top of the cliff. I climbed up, stood on the edge and looked down. I was pretty high up. The height made me dizzy so I backed up and sat down for awhile. I knew I couldn&#8217;t swim, but something in my mind kept telling me, &#8220;You are going to die sooner or later. Why not get it over with? Or else you might have to go back someday, back to your home and live with only one of your parents.&#8221; I put down my bag, and made up my mind.</p>
<p><b>Chapter 5</b><br />
I held Pooh in my arms, closed my eyes, took a deep breath, and jumped. &#8220;If I am lucky and I survive, it would be an experience to tell,&#8221; I thought as I was falling towards the water.</p>
<p>SPLASH! I plunged into the cold water. I tried to figure out how to swim, but it didn&#8217;t work. A few more minutes later, my body felt heavier and heavier. I was grasping for air, trying to get to the surface, and trying to hand onto Pooh hoping that he could help me from sinking. I was pushed out far from the beach by the water currents. I was still holding onto Pooh when my body started to go limp.</p>
<p><b>Epilogue</b><br />
Two days later, Kristi&#8217;s body was washed up onto the beach. Police found the body after finding the knapsack on the cliff. Kristi&#8217;s body laid in her mother&#8217;s arms as her mother quietly thanked the police. Kristi was now at peace, but her family will never be the same. 		</p>
