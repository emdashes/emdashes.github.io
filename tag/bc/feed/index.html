								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				A friend asked me what to do in Vancouver with only a day, while staying near the Waterfront in June without a vehicle. I don&#8217;t spend too much time downtown when I&#8217;m home, but here are some ideas (of course, many of them involving food) &#8211; those in bold are my favourites:<br />
<strong>Food &amp; Drink</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a title="Food truck hours" href="http://streetfoodapp.com/vancouver" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Food trucks/stands</a>, like Tacofino (have not been) or Japadog (been to the store)</li>
<li><strong>Gelato at <a title="Gelato" href="http://www.bellagelateria.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bella Gelateria</a></strong></li>
<li>Lunch time? I hear that <a href="http://meatandbread.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Meat+Bread</a> is good too, especially for the porchetta sandwiches!</li>
<li>Want a local drink? Stop by <a title="Beer" href="http://steamworks.com/brew-pub" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steamworks</a> in Gastown (close by &#8211; their home brew root beer is used to be a nice alternative to alcohol if you&#8217;re not really a drinker) or <a title="More beer" href="http://gib.ca/about/tours-tastings/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Granville Island Brewery</a>, maybe?</li>
<li>Seafood: Joe Forte&#8217;s, if you&#8217;re not on a budget ($$$) &#8211; per J.w&#8217;s recommendation. Especially the miso black cod he would say; fresh catch of the day features at <a title="Dinner menu" href="http://www.vancouverdine.com/sandbar/menus/dinner" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sandbar</a> at Granville Island (or happy hour mussel+fries+beer $12 special), ramen at either Kintaro (get the medium to fatty broth <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f609.png" alt="😉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> ), Santouku (though that&#8217;s available inToronto now too), izayaka at Guu (also in Toronto) or Kingyo (also in Toronto &#8211; haven&#8217;t been to either location), and here&#8217;s a tweet dedicated to sushi:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>@<a href="https://twitter.com/tableformaple">tableformaple</a> DT:Miku ($$$: <a title="http://flic.kr/p/5ZikAS" href="http://t.co/OybP3ljSpG">flic.kr/p/5ZikAS</a>), notbeen: Minami/Tojos, Kits:Hitoe ($$/Jp), Bby:SushiTown ($/Kor), Coq:SushiCali ($/Ko)<br />
— Emily (@bptweets) <a href="https://twitter.com/bptweets/status/329579523421126658">May 1, 2013</a></p></blockquote>
<p><strong>By foot or Skytrain<br />
</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rent a bicycle on Denman and take it for a ride around the Stanley Park seawall</strong> (if pressed for time, this is what I would do first)</li>
<li>Take the seabus over to North Vancouver&#8217;s Lonsdale Quay and browse the market</li>
<li><strong>Take the Rainbow (Aquabus?) ferry to Granville Island from False Creek, and walk around Granville Island</strong> (shopping &#8211; see below, or touring around the Emily Carr Art Gallery), have a bite or a drink or two (like Sandbar  &#8211; see above), or even catch a comedy show at the theatre</li>
<li>Visit the Science Center or Vancouver Aquarium if you like to see fishies and science exhibits (more family friendly)</li>
<li>Shopping (boutiques or shops): Robson and Granville Streets, take the skytrain to Richmond and shop at the Asian malls (like Aberdeen &#8211; get a 8juice there as well from the food court, or a &#8220;snowflake ice&#8221; dessert), Granville Island (and its market)</li>
<li>Walk along the beach at English Bay</li>
<li>Visit the Vancouver Art Gallery or <a title="1/2 price tickets" href="http://www.ticketstonight.ca/half-price-tickets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">catch a show at half price</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>By Bus</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Queen Elizabeth Park</li>
<li>Kits Beach / Jericho Beach / Kitslano</li>
<li>UBC campus (if you like academia settings with mountains and water in the background)</li>
<li>Grouse Mountain (and the Grouse Grind if you like walking up steps up a mountain &#8211; it&#8217;s much more scenic than the CN Tower climb I&#8217;d imagine, but I actually find it quite mundane). Lynn Canyon in North Vancouver (with a free suspension bridge &#8211; skip Capilano if you&#8217;re on a money-saving trip)</li>
<li>Kitslano / Kerrisdale (if you do, then get some Japanese food at Hitoe and french pastries and coffee at <strong>La Foubourg</strong>, and high tea /scones at the Secret Garden Tea Company, visit Rocky Mountain Soap for all natural soap / body products from the West Coast)</li>
</ul>
<p>You may wish to avoid East Hastings near Gastown if you&#8217;re walking, especially at night; it&#8217;s generally safe but if you&#8217;re unfamiliar with the area, it can be an eye-opener.<br />
<em>If you had a car, I&#8217;d definitely suggest a hike up the Chief in Squamish, but I guess that&#8217;s for another day <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></em><br />
Any other suggestions for someone without a car?		</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				2400 kms later, we completed a full circle: from Surrey to Seattle, resting at Coeur D&#8217;Arlene, Idaho, to Calgary, to Banff, resting at Golden, through Kelowna, and back to Surrey in 7 days.<br />
The title of this post should have been &#8220;EJ&#8217;s Trans-America Trip&#8221;, because we were intending to purchase and drive a family car from Vancouver back with stops through Seattle, Portland, Yellowstone National Park, Mount Rushmore, Chicago, but due to a change in plans, the car stayed, but we took it to &#8220;EJ&#8217;s Non-Trans-America Trip&#8221; anyway.<br />
In the 7 days, we encountered pretty much all four (3?) seasons: warm sunshine, rain and cloudy skies, and hail and snow. But, God answered my prayers, and for the days we were outside, the skies were clear, and we stayed dry! We were blessed to be able to borrow my dad&#8217;s bright yellow Matrix (a car I enjoy driving), so that we wouldn&#8217;t have to face hefty rental fees for cross border traveling. There was never a day that we didn&#8217;t spend time with a familiar face (apart from us two, of course), and we hit pretty much everything that was planned on our spreadsheet despite a tight schedule, sometimes with only a few minutes to spare:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Tulip Festival</strong><br />
<a title="IMG_0636 by b.p., on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aimeili/7144038113/"><img alt="IMG_0636" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7182/7144038113_a84b008232.jpg" width="400" height="277" /></a><br />
After less than a 10 minute wait at the Peach Arch border (which is unusual compared to the Truck Crossing), we made our way to Skagit for the tulips! The lady at the information center, told us about <strong>Lopez Island Creamery Ice Cream</strong>, which was well hidden at the back of a side-of-the-road &#8220;produce stand&#8221; at Snowgoose Produce. The gourmet prices for the <a href="http://lopezislandcreamery.com/#our-flavors" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">specialty flavours</a> (Country Raspberry for me, and Clearly Coconut for j.w) were well-worth it, and it was satisfying enough for our lunch without me having to stop at Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory for a frozen chocolate-nut dipped banana<br />
<img alt="" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-qnQKofGzbA4/T-PORbUiq8I/AAAAAAAAF9Y/tapU7f9__7g/s400/IMG-20120425-00033.jpg" width="400" height="267" /></li>
<li>We decided that we would skip Tuliptown (after visiting Roseengarde), so we had time to do a quick zip through Premium Outlets and didn&#8217;t come out empty handed, before heading to a previously booked <strong>Boeing Factory</strong> / Future of Flight Aviation Center tour in Everett, WA. The tour itself was pretty impressive &#8211; you could see people working on the assembly line, and the latest <a href="http://www.boeing.com/commercial/787family/787-8prod.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Boeing Dreamliner</a>. The factory was HUGE; I think they said that they could fit 70 something footballs fields or a couple of Disneyland theme parks in it. And at that size, they had their own personal medical and paramedical services, cafes, dry cleaners, and buses! The $18 fee was definitely worth it (though we cut it close and had maybe 5 minutes to spare by the time we got there)</li>
<li><strong>A Visit with Friends</strong><br />
Surprisingly, traffic from Everett to Bellevue wasn&#8217;t as bad as expected, so we arrived a bit earlier than expected, and just chilled in time for dinner with Virtualawrence, DTse, SH, and EHo at East West, a <a href="http://www.shermansfoodadventures.com/2011/08/facing-east-taiwanese.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Taiwanese restaurant</a> that Virtualawrence mentioned he&#8217;d bring me the next time we visited, which had some interesting dishes and flavours (like the pork burger and 3 cup chicken). with dessert at Yogurtland (though I&#8217;m still not convinced that self serve froyo is better in texture than Yogen Fruz) finished with a drive to Card Kingdom (a purposeful trip, just to find out that the online portion of the store closed for the day earlier that evening), and game or two of Dominion.</li>
<li><img alt="" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-TvRAzwf1s-I/T-POPpD1n2I/AAAAAAAAF9Q/pebtLuLA7oc/s400/IMG_0814.JPG" width="400" height="267" /><br />
After breakfast at a Parisian-style cafe with Virtualawrence (to which Fausbourg, Vancouver wins if compared), we headed out to Woodinville to spend the day with the Chens at their new place. The day passed quickly, but it was a fun time for everyone, even though we were all very sad to leave.<br />
<img alt="" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-7VXHNQPeX3I/T-PKwJn3f-I/AAAAAAAAF8w/Gcwf_N3G66M/s400/IMG-20120427-00037.jpg" width="400" height="300" /></li>
<li><strong>Snoqualmie</strong><br />
<a title="IMG_0854 by b.p., on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aimeili/7146796293/"><img alt="IMG_0854" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5276/7146796293_fc4b69259f.jpg" width="400" height="277" /></a><br />
After a good breakfast the next morning, we opted to spend more time before heading out, so we skipped Leavenworth, a town famous that&#8217;s decked out to be all German. Because of that, we took a different/shorter route, which allowed us to see Snoqualmie Falls and some old, abandoned trains. We also spotted a random helicopter along the I-90E that was carrying wood/logs.</li>
<li><strong>Iron Horses</strong><br />
<a title="IMG_0913 by b.p., on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aimeili/7146802867/"><img alt="IMG_0913" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8012/7146802867_190b70b5c2.jpg" width="400" height="277" /></a><br />
And because we skipped Leavenworth, we took the shorter route and were able to see the iron horses that Waiki told us about, off the I-90. We took a short climb and was rewarded with a lovely view from the top, despite a short bit of snow on the road early on.</li>
<li><strong>Coeur D&#8217;Arlene</strong><br />
<a title="IMG_0941 by b.p., on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aimeili/7146810907/"><img alt="IMG_0941" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7061/7146810907_bd197baaa7.jpg" width="400" height="277" /></a><br />
We finally made it to Coeur D&#8217;Arlene and enjoyed some wine and cheese at the bed &amp; breakfast pre-supper, and a great dinner meal by the host&#8217;s recommendation at a local restaurant called &#8220;<strong>Scratch</strong>&#8221; &#8211; where reportedly, everything is made from scratch on-site. Breakfast was scrumptious as well at McFarland Inn (our B&amp;B) &#8211; they even have their own custom coffee blend from a semi-local roaster</li>
<li><strong>Drive to Calgary</strong><br />
<a title="IMG_1036 by b.p., on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aimeili/7000743194/"><img alt="IMG_1036" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7136/7000743194_127f58e8d8.jpg" width="400" height="250" /></a><br />
Our host at the B&amp;B had told us to watch out for <strong>Frank&#8217;s Slide</strong> and the <strong>Okotoks</strong> along the way to Calgary. We had a beautiful drive: passed by a &#8220;Game crossing sign&#8221;  (immediate thought was board games), random cardboard cows on the top of a hill, two whitetail deers, a town by the name of <strong>Elmira</strong> and <strong>Yahk</strong>, BC  &#8211; the city that was made famous by the Red Paperclip quest, the<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terex_33-19_%22Titan%22" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> world&#8217;s largest truck</a> in <strong>Sparwood</strong>, BC (I didn&#8217;t realize it was once a running truck), and rocky mountain sheep roaming at Crowsnest Pass. The duty-free shop at the US-BC Border looked like a cabin, with sparse goods for sale inside. Unsurprisingly, we didn&#8217;t have to wait much at this border though I am sure the custom officer and the fellows at the duty-free shop wondered what we Asians were doing in that part of the country.</li>
<li><strong>With the Laus</strong><br />
Sunday was spent mostly in Calgary: attended a large, local church for Sunday service and had the opportunity to hear <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erwin_McManus" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Erwin McManus</a> speak, who shared with us some life stories. I don&#8217;t know why I recognize his name, but one lesson that stuck out was avoiding jargon, which is a principle that can be applied to business as well. Some trekkie comiccon was in town as well, but by the time we got there (before 11AM), all the tickets were sold out, so we ended up heading to Banff a bit earlier to explore.</li>
<li><strong>Banff</strong><br />
<a title="IMG_1082 by b.p., on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aimeili/7000750214/"><img alt="IMG_1082" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7059/7000750214_9e77fc9f7d.jpg" width="400" height="250" /></a><br />
This time we stayed at <strong>Banff Aspen Lodge</strong>, at the beginning of the main strip. It looks like a motel on the outside, but you can tell that they spent some money to do some rework to make the rooms nice and modern (and clean) &#8211; the rates were lower than some of the lodging around them, and it even included continental breakfast, with homemade granola.<img alt="" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-0wQdbL7FCi4/T-POMk78uCI/AAAAAAAAF9A/klqitQVcIpE/s400/IMG-20120430-00077.jpg" width="400" height="300" /><br />
Two of the local coffee shops that I would recommend in Banff is <strong>Evelyn&#8217;s</strong> and <strong>Wild Flour</strong> (also mentioned in Where to Eat in Canada), though I think I might like the environment of the latter a little bit more. We also found handmade natural soap at a place called Rocky Mountain Soap &#8211; the lady was very generous in that she even gave us some samples (on the second day, we went back, but the lady wasn&#8217;t there and this other lady didn&#8217;t seem as inviting)!<br />
It&#8217;s interesting to be in Banff, Lake Louise, and Johnston Canyon at this time of the year; snow still lingers on the trails, the lake, and the normally shimmery, reflective turquoise of Lake Louise is covered with white and ice instead. Lake Louise felt the most like winter than spring.<br />
<a title="IMG_1147 by b.p., on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aimeili/7146846127/"><img alt="IMG_1147" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7279/7146846127_86be2e7484.jpg" width="400" height="277" /></a></li>
<li><strong>River to Peaks</strong><br />
<a title="IMG_1199 by b.p., on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aimeili/7000775506/"><img alt="IMG_1199" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5034/7000775506_b99a69c259.jpg" width="400" height="277" /></a><br />
After dinner with the Laus at a burger joint, we went our separate ways, with us headed to Golden, BC to rest our heads. The story of how we even found this accomodation still puzzles me to this day, to which I can only attribute to God&#8217;s provision! I can only surmise that I had sent out an inquiry to a chalet that offered longer-term accomodations, and they had directed us to <a href="http://www.rivertopeaks.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">River to Peaks Inn</a>. Turns out, even though we had booked a King suite, we had the whole place to ourselves (likely because it was still low season, and a relatively new place as an Inn), and our host, Dan was great to deal with and told us a little about how the Inn came to be (was once resort staff residence; he lives next door &#8211; the Inn is in residential area and it looks like a converted duplex) and the simple continental breakfast made the stay seem like an even better deal. Actually, we felt that this was the most comfortable bed in terms of paid accomodations on our trip (did I detect Sheraton hotel bed sheets?). I felt a bit sad that we didn&#8217;t have time to explore Golden, or walk around, because the scenery was just so relaxing, with the view of the mountain and the fresh air around you. And yes, this region is where Kicking Horse coffee comes from!</li>
<li><strong>Sicamous, BC</strong><br />
<a title="IMG_1253 by b.p., on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aimeili/7146874551/"><img alt="IMG_1253" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5348/7146874551_df3775b68d.jpg" width="400" height="277" /></a><br />
We were homeward bound the next morning, but with our first stop in <strong>Sicamous, BC at D. Dutchmen Diary</strong> for <span class="spell">purportedly</span> BC&#8217;s best ice cream (for breakfast?). Maybe I was comparing it to Lopez Island Creamery, but I found this ice cream to be too creamy and pretty standard; I had a good time looking at the llamas and the cows though, though one tried to lick my ice cream! j.w spotted a white and brown speckled eagle along the way as well. Though, in our notes, he also wrote, &#8220;falcon carrying a nest, almost hit [our] car&#8221;<br />
<a title="IMG_1210 by b.p., on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aimeili/7000782466/"><img alt="IMG_1210" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8146/7000782466_45d55697ee.jpg" width="400" height="277" /></a></li>
<li><strong>Kelowna, BC</strong><br />
<a title="IMG_1300 by b.p., on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aimeili/7146945763/"><img alt="IMG_1300" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7268/7146945763_282b4afea6.jpg" width="400" height="277" /></a><br />
And a slight detour to winery country, which brought back memories of my childhood, although we didn&#8217;t see the Ogopogo and only saw what was once the floating bridge in the distance. Instead, we spent time at the <strong>Summerhill Pyramid Winery</strong> for some bubbly wine, and needed time to &#8220;burn&#8221; it off, so we stayed a bit later to share a very lovely three-beet risotto, where the ingredients are sourced organically and locally. This winery is a bit mystical/New Age as it uses a pyramid to age the wine (and all organic), but the acoustics in that thing is pretty crazy. Again, we only had minutes to spare before the winery tour began, but we were not at all impressed at how our tour started: this fellow comes out and starts speaking in Mandarin to two other guys. J.w notices and thinks that he might be the tour guide??? Anyway, he leads them back into the shop, at which point we follow, but then try to flag down someone to explain that we don&#8217;t speak Mandarin (and why would people assume that we do just because we look Chinese?!). And Kelowna of all places? Nevertheless, we refused to follow him, and thankfully, another employee took us for a private tour.</li>
<li><strong>airport Pie</strong><br />
And this was it, the final leg of our trip. One last stop at Chilliwack&#8217;s Airport for some pie. Yes, it&#8217;s weird that airport food would be well-known, and that people go to this tiny, local.small planes airport just to eat. And their pies are popular; in fact, if you go the day of, there is a limit of how many slices of one kind of pie you can buy. If you order in advance, you get a discount too (which we didn&#8217;t know about!)</li>
<li><strong>TWU</strong><br />
okay, so we also stopped at TWU after passing by a flipped tractor trailer on its side &#8211; thankfully we didn&#8217;t need to take that exit to pick up my dad from work, since he was without a car (in our possession). And, we drove home, right in time for dinner at that place with the giant, sweet slushes..can&#8217;t remember the name right now&#8230;was kind of disappointed in the quality; I think I would have preferred the Taiwanese food at Surrey Central more.</li>
<li><strong>Home Sweet Home</strong><br />
then we flew home the very next day. <strong>The end</strong></li>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I remember the last time I flew back for four days to attend a wedding, I told myself not to do that again. Well, I did it again (do I not learn?).</p>
<p>And within a span of 5 months, Vancouver has changed so much: the Canada Line has finished, Shiro on Cambie has closed, they changed the traffic patterns, and there is just so much traffic everywhere (and at all times of the day)! I find that I can&#8217;t follow landmarks anymore such as knowing when to turn on Pinetree Way (onto David) because of the giant 4-way stop, but now it&#8217;s a traffic light. Road work is ongoing as well: I feel like I&#8217;m on a narrower bridge because Port Mann now has medians and other tall fences due to the construction of a second bridge. Everything feels so far away as well &#8211;  20km takes 40 mins to drive!</p>
<p>Alas, this trip has made me realize that I don&#8217;t think I would want to move back despite my love for my family, friends, the mild climate, the water and the mountains. Sadly, I wouldn&#8217;t be able to afford living in greater Vancouver, even if I did get over the traffic issue (*shudders* to think that it reminds me more of Toronto now); the cost of living is just too steep.  The housing market and gas prices are much higher than what I see over here, and yet, BC&#8217;s minimum wage is only $8.00/hour ($6 if you&#8217;re entry level) &#8211; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_minimum_wages_in_Canada">this is the lowest in Canada</a> (Ontario has the highest at $10.25/hr). Annual salaries can&#8217;t be that much higher in BC than what we have over here! In comparison, I feel very rich where I am now. Even if I did live in Surrey or Langley, I&#8217;d quickly lose money if they do implement the $3 one-way toll to travel across the Port Mann Bridge once it is twinned (now here&#8217;s an idea: HOV lane users should be free &#8211; that would encourage carpooling!).</p>
<p>I miss the ocean, mountains and tall evergreens, but we do have a few things like the annual fall leaves that colour the horizons. Despite all these changes, the one thing that hasn&#8217;t changed: my friends are still my friends, and as kind as I remember them! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> (e.g. waking up earlier and meeting for breakfast. Chewie even crossed the Fraser River, picked me up, and drove me to meet up with Boy+family!)</p>
<p>By the way, congratulations <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aimeili/sets/72157624020849607/detail">Miche+Tunger</a>!</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				When folks ask me how my Christmas was, the first thing I can think of is how much I ate! All I remember doing is eating &#8211; multiple times during the day, and one meal after the next. Let&#8217;s review:</p>
<ul>
<h3>HK-style cafe</h3>
<li>Christmas Day &#8211; immediately after landing, we hit a local HK style cafe for a late dinner in Richmond, which was tasty and filling!</li>
<h3>Family meals</h3>
<li>Boxing Day &#8211; our traditional Christmas brunch followed by an extended family dinner</li>
<h3>Sushi and seafood</h3>
<li>Sunday &#8211; lunch at <a href="http://dinehere.ca/coquitlam/sushi-california" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sushi California</a> followed by dinner at my aunt&#8217;s place where my uncle served us delicious home-baked cinnamon rolls for dessert</li>
<p></p>
<caption>All that fish for $41</caption>
<li>Monday &#8211; Our first time snowshoeing with a light packed sandwich for lunch (loved snowshoeing by the way), followed by  dinner with the Oh&#8217;s at a Chinese seafood restaurant. First time j.w&#8217; s tried sea cucumber and was a first time for him to have lobster and crab combined in a dish. Before lunch we stuffed ourselves with Zoo sticks from White Spot (had to share with j.w the only thing I wasn&#8217;t sick of at White Spot when my father worked there for what felt like forever) and their Original sliders.</li>
<h3>Pad Thai and sushi</h3>
<li>Tuesday &#8211; we enjoyed a walk in White Rock and <a href="http://dinehere.ca/white-rock/moni-thai-resturant" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">had pad thai</a> with a friend (nicely done al dente noodles), despite White Rock having a great sushi place. Why? We needed to save our sushi appetite for the evening for all-you-can-eat at Toyama, which by the way, I would recommend paying the extra $5 for their deluxe menu (which includes BBQ black cod, BBQ lamb, and wild pacific salmon sashimi mmmm.  Their oysters were delicious too! Discovered that I&#8217;m not a fan of sea urchin or geoduck sushi though &#8211; really strange textures.</li>
<div style="text-align:center">
</div>
<h3>American portions</h3>
<li>Wednesday &#8211; went down to the States and had frozen yogurt for &#8220;breakfast&#8221;, McDonald&#8217;s chicken nuggets for a &#8220;filler&#8221;, jalapeno pretzel for &#8220;lunch&#8221;, Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory chocolate-dipped frozen banana for &#8220;snack&#8221;, and happy hour appetizers at Applebee&#8217;s for &#8220;dinner&#8221;, and a Starbucks Mocha ice cream mini tub for &#8220;dessert&#8221; (we had to eat it otherwise it would melt on our drive back). My goodness &#8211; that dinner is likely one of the most unhealthiest I have eaten &#8211; between the 4 of us, we shared 2 pounds of wings, 1 basket of deep-fried onion wings, 5 slices of quesadillas (though we took that home), 1 order of potato skins, 2 orders of sliders and fries.</li>
<h3>Dim sum, seafood, and peking duck</h3>
<li>Thursday &#8211; New Year&#8217;s Eve lunch with grandparents at <a href="http://dinehere.ca/coquitlam/kirin-seafood-restaurant-coquitlam" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kirin in Coquitlam</a> for dim sum (no longer recommended as a place to go for dim sum). Dinner feasting at home over steamed giant scallops, huge oysters, and ginger and green onion crab! All home-made by mom. The house smelled like fish and soya sauce but it was all worth it. And, new year&#8217;s count-down at Miche&#8217;s with Earl Grey tea cake for dessert.</li>
<li>Friday &#8211; New Year&#8217;s Day &#8211; we had lunch with the girls at the military woman&#8217;s <a href="http://dinehere.ca/burnaby/po-king-seafood-restaurant#node-66010" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dim sum place on Kingsway</a> (near MacPherson) and dinner at a Chinese restaurant with peking duck!</li>
<h3>More seafood and #1 house special drink</h3>
<li>Saturday &#8211; a brunch/late lunch at <a href=http://dinehere.ca/new-westminster/boathouse-restaurant-the-quayside" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">New Westminster&#8217;s Boathouse</a> (not recommended) to celebrate a friend&#8217;s wedding! And, because of reservation limits, we had an early dinner at the Cannery (before it closed down forever). Now we can say we&#8217;ve been to the Cannery! It&#8217;s too bad that I was left with a negative impression when I alerted the hostess that the ladies washroom was out of soap. Her reply? &#8220;We don&#8217;t have any at all.&#8221; What does that mean? Is it because they&#8217;re closing in 3 months and they don&#8217;t want to be bothered to provide soap for their customers and instead to force them to use bottles of hand sanitizer instead? What do their employees use to wash their hands? *shudder* A filling dinner was followed by a great tasting #1 House Special drink at 8 Juice in Aberdeen (Miche and Tunger&#8217;s recommendation). It&#8217;s a sago pomelo mango and coconut juice mix and they only had a Medium left ($4.50) when they overheard me telling my sister that they were closed. I&#8217;ll be back next time!</li>

</div>
<h3>Chinese food and dessert</h3>
<li>Sunday &#8211; very filling lunch with my aunts at a New Lake Restaurant (Chinese) nearby the church, and then a early dinner (which I could barely eat) at another HK style cafe restaurant in Coquitlam (which was decent), followed by Chinese mango sago dessert at <a href="http://dinehere.ca/vancouver/honey-dessert-house" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Honey Dessert House</a> on Kingsway near Boundary. That was good! They also had great service &#8211; they kept refilling our lemon water and let us sit there for a good two hours (we left when all the young&#8217;uns started coming in which was also an indication that it was getting late).</li>
<h3>Meats</h3>
<li>Monday &#8211; lunch at a new Japanese restaurant in Surrey called <a href="http://dinehere.ca/surrey/sushi-tengoku" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tengoku</a>, which are actually owned by Koreans. The portions aren&#8217;t bad but it&#8217;s nothing outstanding. For dinner, the whole family came over once they heard Ron was bringing steak!</li>
<div style="text-align:center">
</div>
<h3>Taiwanese noodles and shaved ice</h3>
<div style="text-align:center">
</div>
<li>Tuesday &#8211; lunch at Aberdeen in Richmond at the new Taiwanese noodle place (great taste but way too pricey for what you get), followed by dessert at <a href="http://www.frappebliss.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Frappe Bliss</a> in the Food Court upstairs. The shaved ice place is absolutely worth whatever lactose intolerance reaction I encountered. In fact, it&#8217;s more like flavoured shaved milk with fruit and other toppings for $6 a bowl. I was so full that I could barely touch dinner, which was at home with leftover crab and veggies.</li>
</ul>
<p>And, that was my holiday in a nutshell :).		</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Wrong boarding pass, delayed flight, no potable water, and misdirected luggage.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aimeili/4256100708/" title="IMG_1561 by b.p., on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2701/4256100708_a047b25e32.jpg" width="400" height="266" alt="IMG_1561" /></a></p>
<p>Because of the great experience with WestJet last year with holiday travel, I decided that I didn&#8217;t want to risk it with Air Canada and convinced my husband to fly WestJet. I told him that WestJet had the 24-hour no-penalty refund policy, plus that they would take care of you should anything happen with our holiday travels (unlike their major competitor who stranded their passengers last year). Had I known what ended up unfolding, I might have kept my mouth shut, as he now prefers AC.</p>
<h3>Wrong boarding pass</h3>
<p>Upon checking in on Christmas Day, we were warmly greeted by the WestJet agent at the counter, who was still in good spirits despite having to work on Christmas day (something was said about being a WestJet owner!). Perhaps it was Christmas day or our general chit chat that may have distracted him, but after he printed our boarding passes (I guess because only I had mine on my BlackBerry but j.w didn&#8217;t), j.w happened to look down and noticed we weren&#8217;t sitting together. I pointed it out to the agent, who gave a diplomatic response that essentially meant &#8220;don&#8217;t look at me &#8211; that&#8217;s what the system gave me&#8221;. I was certain that we booked our seats together when we had checked in online, but as I was about to say something, j.w looked at his ticket again and asked, &#8220;Who is Allison Wong?&#8221;</p>
<p>For some reason, the WestJet had printed out the wrong boarding pass; it&#8217;s likely that Allison&#8217;s name was the first name that showed under Wong. Funny thing is that j.w turned around and lo, and behold, the next in line was Allison and we knew her! (yes, the agent was surprised too). By the time we waved her over, he had already ripped up her boarding pass. She wasn&#8217;t even going to Vancouver; she was bound for Calgary! At least they caught it &#8211; I mean, what would happen if it was only noticed during security&#8230;or worse, at the gate or on the plane?
</p>
<h3>Delayed flight</h3>
<p>With that out of the way, we went through security without incident and waited at the gate for (to me) the standard holiday delays &#8211; this time for 2 hours. The plane had been caught in Edmonton for deicing, from Kelowna. When it finally arrived, we were moved to a different gate, and Allison had long departed. Because of the rush to move people off and on the plane as they were behind schedule, I have a feeling that&#8217;s why they forgot to refill the potable water.</p>
<h3>No potable water</h3>
<p>Yes, in mid-flight, the WestJet attendant announces over the speakers that a strange occurance had happened: they had seemed to run out of potable water; they must have forgotten to refill it in Toronto. What that meant? No more water in the lavatories to wash dirty hands, and no more coffee or tea. Instead they would provide you with hand wipes or bottled water to rinse your hands. I opted for the bottled option, followed by my own hand sanitizer. Still, it felt very unhygenic (especially if you had to come out of the lavatory to get the bottled water).</p>
<h3>Misdirected luggage</h3>
<p>Once we landed, the luggage came very quickly. Well, one of them did. When one suitcase didn&#8217;t show up and I asked someone if all the luggage was out, I was directed to the baggage counter. Thankfully, I had kept my luggage tags/claim stickers but it was too late when we realized that no, I was not Allison Wong (due to the check-in mistake!). And yes, my suitcase was waiting at YYC (in Calgary). With promises to deliver it to us first thing the next day, I was happy that at least they were able to locate it.</p>
<p>In the morning, a call came asking if we were willing to pick it up for a $100 WJ credit in exchange, which was a very nice gesture on WestJet&#8217;s part. What they failed to tell us was that we had to book a flight within 90 days for a trip within the year. As I didn&#8217;t have plans at the time to travel anytime soon, I was a little annoyed that they didn&#8217;t tell us the catch when we picked up the phone since it takes us almost an hour to get the luggage and come back. Thankfully, I remembered that I could try and apply the credit to my return flight &#8211; which they accepted! Yaay!
</p>
<h3>Epilogue</h3>
<p>J.w says that he&#8217;s not about to choose WestJet again if Air Canada is an option. Me? I just booked with WestJet again to attend a friend&#8217;s wedding in May :). I must say that I&#8217;m not very thrilled at their new reservation system (Sabre). I like their online reservation (and refund) system, but their phone wait times are RIDICULOUSLY long (1.5-2 hours) even after midnight EST, and when you do finally connect to an agent, and they transfer you, it disconnects you! Otherwise, if you try to call the Wedding and Convention line to try and book a seat using a wedding discount code (which by the way, is great when it works), all you get is &#8220;all circuits are in use; please try again later&#8221; instead of being put in the queue. However, I have learned that WestJet <i>gets</i> social media: if their response times on the phones is as great as their responses on Twitter, I think you would have more happy customers. Now if this was my first time with WestJet, I might jump ship, but why do I still choose WestJet? Generally, it&#8217;s because of their attitude towards customers &#8211; they seem to care&#8230;and it sure beats the alternative choice.</p>

Who would&#8217;ve thought? I knew we would have a white Christmas; it fact, I knew that we&#8217;d have a white Christmas from coast to coast this year, but I didn&#8217;t actually <i>expect</i> it to last this long! Thankfully we went to Vegas for a few days to escape from the snow. Anyway, this Christmas has been very unusual: spent extended 1:1 time with parents (sister living w/ now-husband, brother in HK), didn&#8217;t spent time with many friends (apart from New Year&#8217;s Eve, tea with virtualawrence and dinner at BP), had big family Christmas gathering cancelled because of the snow and flu (twice!), dinner with sister&#8217;s in-laws cancelled (flu), hair and docotor appointments cancelled twice (snow), lunch and bubbletea plans cancelled (snow), and even church cancelled (snow). I didn&#8217;t expect to spend so much time at home with family, but it&#8217;s a blessing (like playing blokus with parents). With church being cancelled, I didn&#8217;t have chance to see my friends either (including baby Asher and his parents, a Hebrew name meaning happy&#8221;, albeit my first word-association to &#8220;ash&#8221;) but maybe this gives me a chance to visit <a href="http://www.facebook.com/home.php#/group.php?gid=2224430714" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Surrey Christian Alliance</a>, a church I attended for a few years when I was in high school and see how it&#8217;s changed and grown.<br />
Nostalgia. In speaking with a friend on the phone today, I&#8217;m reminded of our past lives (and of our ages). We spoke of unrequited affections (or conscious decisions for risking certain relationships) and made me think that some of my closest guys friends are now either engaged, married, have (or will soon have) children of their own. Our lives have all taken a different path whether I expected it or not. I&#8217;d never imagined that I would be settling down out East (and I&#8217;m still in denial at times, but a good reason to miss the 10 year reunion &#8211; who goes to those anyway?). I&#8217;m still a local girl at heart, but God seems to have other plans for now, an adventure in the making: 2009 will certainly mark a new chapter of my life &#8211; an exciting one I hope!		</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>2007 has come and gone, and thinking back, it has been quite an eventful year; it certainly ended quite unexpectedly. The oddest thing is that by the time I had to leave Vancouver this time, I actually looked forward to coming back. I&#8217;m not really sure if it was because the week passed by so fast &#8211; going from one place to another, seeing people, etc. &#8211; that I had no time to think, but this time, I didn&#8217;t mind flying back East. Perhaps, it is because of the one Sunday while I was at KWCAC that I suddenly felt at home (the same feeling crept up during an evening drive back to my house).</p>
<p>Maybe it is the familiar is what I equate as home. During my stay in Vancouver, I spent time with <strike>three</strike> four groups of friends. In <strike>two</strike> three, I felt that I was stuck in a time warp. In my mind, I expect them to be who I know them as, but of course, over the course of time, people change (including myself). They act familiar but I feel like a stranger, on the outside looking in. While I find it interesting to catch up, so much has happened that I cannot possibly connect or relate. Yet, I felt more comfortable with the last group, most of whom I just saw recently in KW.</p>
<p>By the way, WestJet has a fairly new and enviro-friendly feature. You can <a href="http://mobile.westjet.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">check-in on your mobile device</a> and then have them e-mail you an electronic boarding pass. The security officers might be thoroughly confused as it appears some have never seen them before in YVR or YYZ (and thus take longer to check your credentials), but in the end, I save paper, time in printing a boarding pass out, and I don&#8217;t have to worry about losing it. I just need to ensure that I have enough batteries to show them the electronic boarding pass.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[I flew WestJet from YKF for a short weekend trip back home to attend cs&#8217; wedding. The decision to fly from YKF was a great one: the flights weren&#8217;t full so on the way there, we had an extra seat between us (2 people), and on the way back, I was able to use all 3 seats 🙂 (which meant a choice between 2 tvs since 1 wasn&#8217;t quite working). On the way back, I chose to sit in Row 11(A), which I had hoped was the emergency exit (more leg room), but 11 was the row in front &#8211;…]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				I flew WestJet from YKF for a short weekend trip back home to attend cs&#8217; wedding. The decision to fly from YKF was a great one: the flights weren&#8217;t full so on the way there, we had an extra seat between us (2 people), and on the way back, I was able to use all 3 seats <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> (which meant a choice between 2 tvs since 1 wasn&#8217;t quite working). On the way back, I chose to sit in Row 11(A), which I had hoped was the emergency exit (more leg room), but 11 was the row in front &#8211; which seemed to work out because I had 2 full windows as opposed to the average of 1.5 (maybe because it was in front of the emergency exit so they used the extra room) and I didn&#8217;t have to worry about handling the emergency door. Only thing is that the seats don&#8217;t recline (as predicted on <a href="http://www.seatguru.com/airlines/Westjet/Westjet_Boeing_737-700.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">seatguru.com</a>). The window seat also provided more storage space (under seat in front) as it was wider than the aisle seat and the middle seat had some sort of console blocking the leg/storage room.<br />
The view from the window was gorgeous &#8211; especially on the way to BC. With the sun setting, we passed over the Rocky Mountains. I could see the tips of the mountains covered with snow, and the glacial lakes in the craters. I marvelled at the creation and as we descended, my thoughts were on how small the people, cars, and the things below were, but we have measure words like tall, to describe these people. Yet, even though we are this small, God still cares.<br />
I recently read <a href="http://www.granvilleonline.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">granville magazine</a> and I now realise that flying isn&#8217;t that great for the environment. I&#8217;ve also noticed that being green is very &#8220;in&#8221; right now &#8211; while reading the magazine, I recollected the &#8220;green&#8221; condo in TO, that was selling for close to a million dollars. The magazine mentioned another buzzword, &#8220;sustainability&#8221; which reminded me of Vonnekins, who did ES at UW and wondered how she feels about the current eco-trends.</p>

<p>The wedding was nice and small, simple and thoughtful, and a joy to attend. The choice to go with a Western wedding (as opposed to Chinese) was refreshing as well. Even though it rained (which prompted for the outdoor wedding to be moved into the solarium), the grey overcast skies probably provided even better lighting for photographs &#8211; less harsh shadows and no risk of sun flares. I think Mur and I were especially happy to see the first of among our closer friends during our high school years to be married. Oh, how we&#8217;ve grown. I only hope that we continue our friendships even after we are all married.<br />
PS. Hi Boy, I just received your postcard yesterday &#8211; I guess it took them 2 weeks to send it <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f61b.png" alt="😛" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />		</p>

				<description><![CDATA[BAC recently had a series on friendship. The term &#8220;soul friends&#8221; reminded me of Anne of Green Gable&#8217;s definition of bosom friends, or kindred spirits &#8211; friends, regardless of age, who you have a spiritual and emotional connection with &#8211; and who are of the same gender. I didn&#8217;t know how to respond to these talks as during the time of &#8220;open sharing&#8221;, I couldn&#8217;t even come up with even one name, of which I would call a current &#8220;soul&#8221; friend (though I do have girl friends who I would deem &#8220;close&#8221;).

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.burnabyalliancechurch.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BAC</a> recently had a series on friendship. The term &#8220;soul friends&#8221; reminded me of Anne of Green Gable&#8217;s definition of bosom friends, or kindred spirits &#8211; friends, regardless of age, who you have a spiritual and emotional connection with &#8211; and <i>who are of the same gender</i>.</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t know how to respond to these talks as during the time of &#8220;open sharing&#8221;, I couldn&#8217;t even come up with even one name, of which I would call a current &#8220;soul&#8221; friend (though I do have girl friends who I would deem &#8220;close&#8221;).</p>
<p>This time (without the rush of Christmas and because I had spent time with family during Christmas), I had the chance to hang out with a few of my friends in Vancouver. I really enjoyed the fellowship I had with them. From dining out in Gastown and waking up at 6AM for breakfast in Chinatown, to playing Munchkin (and making an opponent drop 6 levels!),  hanging out with another friend for one whole day (getting his errands done), and finally ending the trip with a great lunch with 20+ people, most of whom I rarely see, or have not talked with in a long time &#8211; I think it would be a great community builder if this happened more often after church (this does here in &#8216;loo, but not at home and there&#8217;s nothing like food to keep spirits up and conversations going).</p>
<p>Strangely enough, the week after,  the theme of the week in my devotionals also reminded me of these friendships&#8230;and admittedly, I have very few &#8220;soul friends&#8221; who are girls (though from what the pastor said, we should be diligent in praying for them, which I am guilty of not doing or wanting to do). For me, I&#8217;m not sure why friendships with girls seem to come harder than with guys. I guess over the years at my home church, with more guys than girls in my age group, I ended up connecting with more guys than with girls. Or, perhaps it is the risk of losing another &#8220;soul&#8221; friend &#8211; at times, I feel that I still have yet to come to terms with how much two people can change so that a great friendship just becomes a mere &#8220;aquaintanceship&#8221;.</p>
<p>I think the place where I am now, increases the difficulty in me opening up for the possibility of &#8220;soul&#8221; friends; I recently termed it as &#8220;being stuck in a time warp&#8221;; it feels like I&#8217;m stuck in a place where faces keep changing, but they are all of the same age range (and profession: student) but I&#8217;m just here, getting older. There are, of course, career people in my spiritual community (few and far between), but there&#8217;s a gap from where they are, and where I am. You know, if I ever was to leave, it would be because to escape this time warp; and that rattles me, because it means that this could be the start of wanting to leave this place as reluctant as I am.</p>

<p>A side note: does anyone know how to use Technorati for tagging or categorizing blog posts, or if they can recommend a plug-in or something to add categories/tags to a custom blog?</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Did you know that it is illegal in Ontario to fill an out-of-province prescription?</p>
<p>Never mind out of country, but what harm can out-of-province be? Though, I suppose<br />
one can get marijuana in BC for medicinal purposes but may not be accepted here. However, in Alberta, you can fill out-of-province prescriptions.</p>
<p>My options?</p>
<ul>
<li>Get it filled online and pay for shipping</li>
<li>Buy it in the States, as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naproxen">Naproxen</a> is available over the counter</li>
<li>Use an old prescription that I found as I was cleaning up my room the other day, which coincidentally had the same drug in a smaller quantity on the form*.</li>
</ul>
<p>*The pharmacist had told me that while they refuse to fill out-of-province prescriptions, they can fill old ones at their discretion</p>
<p>I felt like such a druggie  and wanted to cry when the pharmacist told me she couldn&#8217;t help me and I responded by asking, &#8220;so how can I get another prescription?&#8221; She told me I had to go to a walk-in clinic to which I said forget it, I can&#8217;t afford that (the 3 hours wait for a 30 second session). Rather frustrating seeing that I went to the doctor (which I prefer to avoid) for no reason (and that I could&#8217;ve filled it before I left but due to time and other constraints (like forgetting to bring it with me when I went to the mall), I didn&#8217;t).</p>
