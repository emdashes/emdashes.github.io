								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				<![CDATA[One day, after winning 30 CDs in a draw (completely unexpected as I didn't even know what I had entered), I decided to organize my collection and came to note the following:


<ul>


<li>I have over 100 music CDs, even after giving 1/3 to 1/4 of my winnings away</li>




<li>Of which, 90% of them are from Christian bands/music</li>




<li>1/2 of which I don&#8217;t listen to on a regular basis</li>




<li>90% of them were either given to me or bought for under $10 since late high school/early university (I have this unwritten rule that I cannot spend over $10 per CD)</li>




<li>The total networth of these CDs, if I paid retail price at 10$, would be at least $1000. Wow, that is a huge sum.</li>

</ul>


<b>Here&#8217;s your chance to win a CD</b>
Thus, to encourage photography enthusiasts to enjoy the spring season, I am giving away at least 1 of 2 CDs: 12 Stones and <a href="http://www.jump5.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jump 5: Accelerate</a>.
The details:


<ol>


<li>Submit a original photograph that best fits with either the word <i>purple</i> or <i>creator</i>. One entry per category per photographer/entrant please.</li>




<li>Photographs will only be accepted in digital format no larger than 3 MB sent via email to purplecreator [at] sheepie.net. Please write in the subject line: <i>Purple Creator Submission: Purple</i> or <i>Purple Creator Submission: Creator</i> or your email may be filtered out. If you experience difficulties sending your entry, send me a message via my other email address or IM and I will confirm receipt of your submission.</li>




<li>Please limit photo modifications to basic touch-ups/editing.</li>




<li>Submissions will be accepted until 11:59 PM EST on June 7, 2006.</li>




<li>Profane and/or offensive pictures will be deleted and will not be considered. I realise that art is subjective, but please use your discretion.</li>
