								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				One day, after winning 30 CDs in a draw (completely unexpected as I didn&#8217;t even know what I had entered), I decided to organize my collection and came to note the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>I have over 100 music CDs, even after giving 1/3 to 1/4 of my winnings away</li>
<li>Of which, 90% of them are from Christian bands/music</li>
<li>1/2 of which I don&#8217;t listen to on a regular basis</li>
<li>90% of them were either given to me or bought for under $10 since late high school/early university (I have this unwritten rule that I cannot spend over $10 per CD)</li>
<li>The total networth of these CDs, if I paid retail price at 10$, would be at least $1000. Wow, that is a huge sum.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Here&#8217;s your chance to win a CD</b><br />
Thus, to encourage photography enthusiasts to enjoy the spring season, I am giving away at least 1 of 2 CDs: 12 Stones and <a href="http://www.jump5.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jump 5: Accelerate</a>.<br />
