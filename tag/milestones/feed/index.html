								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
				<![CDATA[<p>Another year has flown by and has it been one of growing:</p> <p>We&#8217;ve had the joy to watch Little Brother be a part of the family, and influencing his sister to creatively explore boundaries (Bean&#8217;s thinking: what? the mattress can be a bouncy castle? and the couch seats can come apart and be a landing mat? Let&#8217;s do it!).</p> <p>Language literacy: from broken English at the start of the year to full-on conversations with his sister in English (almost) all the time, which is way too much &#8211; but as Bean observed, the parents speak to each other in English all the time as well. He surprised me when he verbally counted to 10 in both French and Spanish as well; I&#8217;m also surprised that he manages to get through an hour of weekly Cantonese classes!</p><p>I credit his recognition of numbers from 1-8 to the numbers of the trains, and his colour-recognition also to Thomas. We&#8217;ve</p> also seen his keen interest in music and singing (but not others singing while he&#8217;s singing), and in storytime and books. I especially cherish the times, when he says sorry and means it (he also smart about saying sorry to get out of trouble) and at meal times, particularly when he is enjoying his food, he asks who made it and thanks the person who did! <p>Motor skills: from falling down stairs to mastering riding a tricycle; from solving puzzles patiently to picking up art activities like colouring (scribbling) and playdough; from playing with his trains &#8211; Thomas, to zooming around with Lighting McQueen and his Hot Wheels cars and car wash garage station, and firetrucks; from taking off his clothes by himself to putting on his shirt, jacket (and zipping), socks, and boots by himself.</p> <p>Pretend play and following his sister: it&#8217;s really confusing when they&#8217;re addressing each other around us as he&#8217;s the baby and she&#8217;s the mommy/mama. But, it&#8217;s so endearing when they get along and act in their assigned roles &#8211; him being so forgiving without seeming to mind that she&#8217;s bossing him around for the most part. Though he&#8217;s a preschooler, he&#8217;s truly still the baby when it comes to falling asleep and sleeping independently.</p> <p>This upcoming year will our last with him before he enters school; I think he&#8217;ll be ready when September rolls along!</p>]]&gt;		]]></content:encoded>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				<![CDATA[That's our office cat in the photo. I'm one month in. And yet, it feels like a lot longer than that. I've found a rhythm that works with this new routine, and I'm thankful that both our kids have adjusted well too. Consequently, we transitioned our oldest to full day kindergarten, and after some trial and error, we dropped her afternoon nap, we eat dinner earlier, and they go to sleep earlier. Unfortunately, our youngest still wakes up at night and asks for food then, but our oldest seems to fall asleep faster and stays asleep throughout the night for the most part. This week has been one of the few germ-free weeks this year, so it's a nice relief to not have to deal with that (if it wasn't him, it was her, and if it wasn't either of them, it was us or our daycare) - I'm grateful that our workplaces are pretty flexible when it comes from work from home policies and taking time off / emergency days, so we pretty took turns staying home with one child or both children. How do working families who don't have backup plans / caregivers manage?
At the beginning, it sort of felt like I was starting at a new school in the middle of the school year; I had a lot to learn and a lot of faces and names to remember. I still have a lot to learn and faces and names to remember, but it feels like I'm making an impact. I'm also thankful that I enjoy my work, so it's easy to wake up earlier and rush out the door.
We will have to find a different routine come summer, but so far, it's been working out just perfectly. I'm glad I scaled back my hours (before signing the offer) because it turns out if you're driving a car for school pick-up, you pretty much have to arrive in the neighbourhood at least 20 minutes early in order to find available street parking around the perimeter of the school; otherwise, you're pretty much out of luck. And even though I get off at 2:30PM, by the time I get everyone home, it's 4PM. I then give them a small snack, work on unloading the dishwasher and getting another load in, and starting supper. By the time we are done dinner, it's close to 7PM, and we play a bit then bathe (if applicable), and then off to bed. After that, I clean up the kitchen (pack food away, prep lunches) and maybe wash or fold the laundry. I've been doing laundry on weekends in loads, so I can just sit and binge-watch Netflix (working through The Crown) while folding.
Surprisingly, I find myself dozing off before midnight and using the computer less after work (but still on my phone) - maybe it's because I no longer have mid-day naps or work is more tiring than staying at home (though I feel it's a break / nice change from home life). I'm on a modified work week, and I'm already wondering how full-time working parents do this every day and survive? I applaud those families!
Other than work and school, we started going to a different small group / life group, which has changed to an earlier start time, which means for the first time in a long time, we actually get to stay past dinner. We have also started going to another church, primarily because Bean is at an age where she is learning, and I simply can't go on teaching her every week - and when I don't, I hear implied comments about going to a different church anyway. I'm a little sad, but since I also miss fellowship time because I'm watching them after service is over while everyone else is chatting and because people don't tend to eat together for lunch as much anymore, I'm not really connecting with anyone either. I know Bean misses it because on occasion, she tells me she wants to go back to Simply, or that she wants me to be her teacher that day, and every time we pass by St. Paul's, she points out that it's our church. Finding a new church to call home is hard. Personally, I don't like the format of the sermons by the lead pastor at this new church so far (grossly paraphrased: partial verses are taken from different translations to fit into the sermon's points) though the supporting pastor actually goes into a passage in contrast, but the kids seem to have adjusted so well even at the first visit and a lot of effort is put into the children's spiritual wellbeing and education. So yes, 2018 is going to be a year of change and adjustment.


<hr />
Two years ago, we were celebrating <a href="http://her.happyhippos.ca/2016/02/two-month-milestones/">two month milestones</a>. Now, at 2, he&#8217;s come a long way:


<ul>
    

<li>Speaks in complete sentences. Has started to communicate (and copy) in English. Boo.</li>


    

<li>Enjoys climbing and doing crazy things and will deliberately test boundaries with people in authority (me &#8211; he&#8217;s heavy so I can&#8217;t just pick him up and grab him while grocery shopping for example, so I don&#8217;t go when I&#8217;m on my own as it&#8217;s impossible to get more than one or two things in one trip)</li>


    

<li>Loves to sing, and can sing many songs in English including the Alphabet song, Twinkle Twinkle Little Star, Away in the Manger, Roly Poly and can sing along with or recognize songs by Walk Off the Earth, Moana, and Frozen.</li>


    

<li>Loves trains, especially Thomas. And cars. And airplanes. Prefers trains though, if given a choice.</li>


    

<li>Easily sucked in by technology: photos on the phone, TV, iPad game, and YouTube videos. One time early on, the caregiver gave an older child a tablet to use while the younger ones were supposed to nap; he had a meltdown and refused to sleep. Then she figured out why (we had warned her prior so she made the connection and no more problems since).</li>


    

<li>Has not completely weaned. So, I&#8217;m still off dairy and some nuts. Nuts!</li>


    

<li>While he started off with liking meat, he doesn&#8217;t seem to like meat (fish the exception) as much anymore, unless it&#8217;s chicken nuggets/fingers/crispy. He will still eat it but when it is in chunks, he tends to pick it out. He also doesn&#8217;t like green fiber veggies, but will repeatedly down it in smoothie form. Like his sister, he loves fruit. Avocados, bananas, and cereal with alternative milk are now his favourite breakfast foods. He is a soup and rice monster. Sometimes noodles too.</li>


    

<li>Self-toilet training is hit and miss so far &#8211; and if successful, it&#8217;s still only #2 (though a few times, he wakes up with a dry diaper and will go if you put him on the toilet); progress seems to have slowed down or regressed especially now that he doesn&#8217;t tell his caregiver he needs to go (or maybe she hasn&#8217;t learned the signs yet)</li>


    

<li>He may have had a mini <a href="http://her.happyhippos.ca/2017/04/the-day-we-had-our-first-ambulance-ride/">febrile seizure</a> the other week, when he had a slight fever (while fighting off strange rashes &#8211; maybe mild symptoms of hand, foot, mouth + reaction to lactose in Tylenol) but it lasted no more than a few seconds and it was in his sleep.</li>


    

<li>He seems interested in people he knows (and babies) &#8211; often willing to share a toy, asking for someone by name, offering hugs to those he loves (except it&#8217;s sad to see hugs not reciprocated, especially when his sister comes out from dance class and he goes to hug her and she brushes him off; however, she always asks to go into timeout with him when he&#8217;s in trouble), and enjoys helping out in the kitchen (putting dishes away, watching and helping mommy cook/bake)</li>


    

<li>He must have shorter legs or something, because he fits his age in tops when it comes to sizing but his bottoms are behind a bit.</li>


</ul>


I&#8217;m amazed at how fast our children is growing up, now that we all have slightly different routines and that they are no longer babies.]]&gt;		</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				<![CDATA[It's the time of the year again: it's back to school season, and with only a few days remaining of summer, I'm starting to feel a bit anxious about school - and I'm not even the one that's starting school!


<h3>Homeschooling</h3>


I have been reflecting a bit about school for the past few months &#8211; in fact, this post started as a post about homeschooling back in May, as more and more families we knew were homeschooling or planning to homeschool. I briefly considered it, and even paid to check out the <a href="http://www.kwchea.ca/conference.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">KWCHEA</a>&#8216;s homeschool conference exhibit hall to look at resources and get a better sense of what is available for a homeschooling family.  While buying into curriculum and paying for supplementary classes to supplement a child&#8217;s education / learning can be costly (vs. free public school education), I found that there were plenty of free resources (and you could develop your own curriculum as a result) and quite a bit of local support (e.g. free gym time for homeschooled children, email lists) so that you could still have social interaction with other peers. I also found that there were a few memberships that were free to join if your oldest child is under 6 years old,  which gives you access to a support network and perks like (significant) discounts to places like Great Wolf Lodge. But, what a vendor said got to me &#8211; partly because my first feeling was &#8220;no, it&#8217;s not!&#8221; but then I know that there is some truth to what he said: he basically told me that home education was God&#8217;s calling for all Christian families because the responsibility lies with the parents to teach their children and because that was how it was done historically/biblically (ie. why leave it to other people to do that). I thought about the examples in the Bible, and how children learned their father&#8217;s trade as an apprentice (yes, that supports what he&#8217;s saying), but then didn&#8217;t the young men go off to the synagogue to learn scripture from the pharisees / teacher of the law? And if it&#8217;s God&#8217;s calling for every Christian family to homeschool their children, that must mean that most are ignoring His calling &#8211; is that possible and true? With homeschooling, I know I don&#8217;t have to be as worried about the impacts of early sex education, or the in-your-face celebration of gender rights and gay pride, but I don&#8217;t want to shelter my kids either.
At first, I didn&#8217;t want to consider homeschooling my children because my first exposure to a homeschooler wasn&#8217;t a very positive experience, when a student who had attended a public elementary school, then moved to being homeschooled (maybe due to her being teased for being a Jehovah&#8217;s Witness?), and then in high school tried to transition back, but she didn&#8217;t last very long and was pulled out. So, I&#8217;m biased to think that the transition from home education to public might be really difficult and not successful.


<h3>Public education</h3>


Among the selfish reasons why I didn&#8217;t want to homeschool is that I didn&#8217;t want to deal with the social isolation, or forcing myself and the children to interact with other homeschooled families &#8211; or trying to find ways to be socially involved, be it signing up for supplementary classes ($) or leading co-op-like initiatives. Then again, while I excelled and really enjoyed the academic parts of school, I don&#8217;t think I really felt like I truly fit in socially (oh, the insecure me, but perhaps it&#8217;s reflective of what the Bible says about being in this world, but not of it, or <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-11.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">being foreigners</a>[ref]&#8221;If you were of the world, the world would love you as its own; but because you are not of the world, but I chose you out of the world, therefore the world hates you.&#8221; Matthew 5:19 ESV[/ref]). Maybe it was due to a combination of language struggles, cultural differences, and a Christian upbringing; I&#8217;m not really sure.[ref]Case in point, 6-year-old-me awkwardly learned that just because the teacher is Chinese, it doesn&#8217;t mean that a) she speaks Chinese and b) that she can read my name in Chinese, when the worksheet says &#8220;Name:&#8221; on it. Likewise, just because she is Chinese, it also doesn&#8217;t mean she knows what <span id="result_box" class="short_text" lang="zh-TW"><span class="">白花油 is and its medicinal purposes &#8211; and will tell you to take it off because it smells -_- (embarrassed of my mom moments) . Though, </span></span>I was super happy to find a Chinese student (Canadian-Chinese) who appreciated my baked BBQ pork bun lunches.[/ref]
One downside of following the crowd, kids these days are entering the education system as early as 3 years old, and at full days &#8211; without naps &#8211; too! Great for paying parents as they can save on childcare expenses, but for those young ones who have meltdowns because of missed naps, personally I think it&#8217;s too much, too soon (probably because my generation started as young as 4 years old only at half days). Actually, it&#8217;s nice that kindergarten is optional for families here, but if I hold them back, I feel that they would miss out on key social interaction development and other learning milestones and will lag far behind when starting Grade 1, especially if one throws in French immersion into the mix.
I pray that her social experiences be better than mine, especially as she navigates the first few years of school! And I pray as a parent, that we&#8217;ll be responsible for keeping on top of what is being taught so that we can supplement with truth and a biblical worldview when necessary.


<h3>Change</h3>


As we transition into a new chapter of our lives (including new morning routines and making school-friendly lunches), I&#8217;m comforted that even though I was a bit disappointed to learn that there are 6 kindergarten classes in her school and none of her friends (or the other couple of kids we know) are in the same class, she is really excited and looking forward to starting school (much more so than when I teach her in Sunday School). After going through the <a href="https://www.strongstart.ca/programs/get-ready-for-school/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Get Ready for School</a> program, she has loved programs and have done so well in them.  When people ask me if we&#8217;re ready, this blogger mom sums up my feelings quite well: <a href="http://blog.mops.org/paving-the-runway/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">&#8220;She was so ready – that made one of us.  I’m not sure if I’m finally relieved to have some time to myself [or more time with the youngest, rather] or if I’m just terribly sad&#8221;.</a>  I know little brother will miss her dearly too, and I&#8217;m sure I won&#8217;t know what to do with just him at the beginning but here&#8217;s to change, God willing!]]&gt;		</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				<![CDATA[While he was very stoic and mono-expression before, Little Brother is becoming quite the character, is generous with his smiles, and has quite the appetite.[ref]despite not going up to a week, sometimes! :([/ref]
Some things he enjoys:


<ul>
    

<li>he prefers soft veggies like squashes over green leafy vegetables (too stringy / fibrous), all soft meat &#8211; chicken, pork, but not steak, fish, and almost all fruits, especially oranges[ref]portion-wise, he eats the same amount as his sister now, if not more![/ref]</li>


    

<li>looking at the world upside down</li>


    

<li>studying younger babies</li>


    

<li>shrieking in laughter, especially when his sister eggs him on</li>


    

<li>plunking at keys (computer and piano keyboards)</li>


    

<li>building with Lego and cars (more so than his sister did, but maybe because his sister is more interested in them now)</li>


    

<li>looking at pictures in books, especially when on the toilet (he asks for them by pointing to where they are stored)</li>


    

<li>sneaking up the stairs (while we were unaware), climbing and standing on chairs (probably seeing his sister do that) &#8211; he&#8217;s definitely less cautious than his sister &#8211; maybe a combination of being a boy, a second-child, and his own personality differences</li>


    

<li>helping mommy unload the dishwasher &#8211; cutlery is his forte, though sometimes he will &#8220;help&#8221; unload his cup by doing quality control on it first and pretending to drink from it</li>


    

<li>playing with water, especially when washing his hands</li>


    

<li>toddling around (now that he&#8217;s walking around with a lot more confidence)</li>


</ul>


Month 14 and 15 seemed pretty significant:


<ul>
    

<li>he took his first unassisted steps at around the 14 month mark (2 months sooner than his sister)</li>


    

<li>2 week long cold/flu, where he spat up a couple of times, but it coincided when our house was sick last year as well</li>


    

<li>at his check-up, he weighed in as being on the 25th percentile (5x his sister!), around 50th percent in height, but 70th in head circumference (<em>not my genes!</em>); the doctor did comment that they are actually more interested in head circumference than length since a spike in the head size curve could mean a tumor or something unusual in there</li>


    

<li>figuring out how to drink properly from a sippy cup (and turning it over and tapping liquid from the unsealed ones all over the tray)</li>


    

<li>&#8220;painting&#8221;[ref]using a brush and water to bring color in a magic book[/ref] for the first time</li>


    

<li>mommy feeding him mixed nut butter (no peanuts) with no reaction the first time, but breaking out in hives and redness that required two doses of Benadryl to calm it down &#8211; <em>sigh</em>, more allergens to watch out for.</li>


</ul>


The doctor says that he&#8217;s supposed to say about 20 words by now, but while he&#8217;s not there yet (probably 3-4 words he says independently), his vocabulary seems to have exploded over the past two months. Resignedly, many of them are in English (sigh) as he&#8217;s picking up what his sister often says:


<ul>
    

<li>babbling, with first words at 14 months that seem to be associated with a meaning, but often copied instead of independently said, like &#8220;bao bao&#8221; (bread, but I realize that his meaning actually encompasses all food), &#8220;wow&#8221;, &#8220;POP&#8221; (goes the weasel), <em>mum mum</em> (food, not me) and now it extends to ow, snack, <em>woh woh </em>(dog), <em>mao mao </em>(cat)</li>


    

<li>signing more (food) by tapping all his fingers together, like in a teepee</li>


    

<li><em>nein nein</em>: wants mommy&#8217;s milk (that&#8217;s how he greets me now too, not mama &#8211; I&#8217;ve been reduced to breastmilk, sigh)</li>


    

<li><em>ma ma</em> (paternal grandmother) (15 months) paired with <em>yeh yeh</em> (paternal grandfather), which he had started calling long before <em>ma ma</em></li>


    

<li>using certain actions for certain songs, at certain parts of songs (like lifting his arms &#8220;when they&#8217;re up they&#8217;re up&#8221; for Grand Ol&#8217; Duke of York)</li>


    

<li>plays word games by repeating after you like counting from 1-5, but only saying 1 or 5 repeatedly: him: <em>YUT, </em>me: <em>yee, sam, say, </em>him: <em>NG; </em>sometimes he just says 5 or 1 before we even get there</li>


    

<li>he also understands what you say, like go get the ball, but even when you&#8217;re not talking to him (such as if I said to his sister, go wash your hands, he suddenly decides he wants to be done with his meal too, or I talk about shoes and he goes and grabs some)</li>


</ul>


A bittersweet stage: <em>our little boy is growing up!</em>]]&gt;		</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				<![CDATA[In milestones news, I can't believe how fast time seems to fly for #2. I think partially because he is the second child so it's not as lonely, but also because at the back of my mind, I keep thinking&nbsp;that&nbsp;he may be our last baby (and thus, no more "baby" moments)!
Now that he's moved beyond 12 months, here's what we have observed:


<ul>
    

<li>No distinguable words &#8211; despite the <a href="http://www.ndds.ca/ontario" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NNDS guidelines</a> saying that we should recognize 3 words by 9 months. We don&#8217;t recognize any consistent words, although he has recently be saying &#8220;yeh yeh yeh yeh&#8221; when his paternal grandfather is around, so it might be a correlation. He&#8217;s also copied his sister and said &#8220;Dad-dy&#8221; or &#8220;dada&#8221; and other syllables, but they don&#8217;t seem to be repeated in any sort of associated pattern.</li>


    

<li>Can freely stand and cruise along furniture, with a walker or while holding your hand &#8211; the first time he did on a walker, he had a blast, laughed for half an hour; crawls like a limping dog</li>


    

<li>Has taken a few steps, seemingly unintending to &#8211; but like <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+14:29-31" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Peter walking on water</a>, once he realizes he&#8217;s taken a few steps, he stops and falls (or sits down).</li>


    

<li>Has given up the pacifiers completely</li>


    

<li>Dropped his morning nap, not by choice</li>


    

<li>Understands signs or follows your questions, like claps his hands to music though he first wiping his hands instead of clapping, taps his head for head, recognizes and looks up when I say, &#8220;light&#8221;, puts a phone to his ear when I say, &#8220;Hello?&#8221; and mimics mommy. When I say &#8220;mummum&#8221; or put him in the high chair, he immediately clasps his hands in prayer.&nbsp;</li>


    

<li>Enjoys playing games with you, like foot games and hand games</li>


</ul>


In other news, Bean has self-designated herself as being a &#8220;baby&#8221; more often now, putting toys and teethers into her mouth (which she didn&#8217;t do), asking to be fed and held, crawling around (which she didn&#8217;t do), asked to be called her brother&#8217;s name and saying that the baby is the big sister, and mimicking baby coos.]]&gt;		</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				<![CDATA[Wow. Having just returned&nbsp;from the Western Caribbean/Florida and trying to write a recap,&nbsp;I come across this post sitting in my draft. It looks like I wrote down some notes, but never finished it, and I'm not sure if I ever will, so let's expand on some memories and post it now.


<hr />
The decision to visit during the summer, during peak&nbsp;travel period wasn&#8217;t on the table but we did&nbsp;have vague plans to visit sometime to meet my sister&#8217;s baby&nbsp;and for the rest of my family to meet ours. As it turned out, my aunt was getting remarried and invited everyone to their banquet reception and the timing worked, so we redeemed aeroplan points for one way, and bought tickets back after school started so the prices were much better[ref]thankfully, we didn&#8217;t have to modify travel plans as&nbsp;some extended family members had[/ref]. &nbsp;At the wedding is where I get a 3-minute lesson from a cousin on whiskey-tasting 101: taking a sip straight up, then sucking in one breath of air after a sip, and finally with 1 drop of ice in the shot before taking a sip &#8211; each one delivering a different profile / depth.
We all managed to get through the plane rides without too many tears. Bean sat in a car seat, which&nbsp;I much preferred her to be in than in a seat with just a lap belt; the height also allowed her to look out the window. She was happy to watch TV in silence (but no naps), and on the way back, we survived without having a seat back entertainment system &#8211; it also seems that the flight from YXX-Abbotsford is shorter by an hour! The baby was sure different from when Bean was his age &#8211; I couldn&#8217;t nurse him to sleep and keep him asleep; j.w&nbsp;had to help / intervene.

Warm sunny weather welcomed us at the start of our vacation, which made the trip to the&nbsp;Sea to Sky Summit very worthwhile, as it was warm and skies were clear so you could see the views&nbsp;without having to hike up the Chief&nbsp;(photo: that&#8217;s neither me nor Bean). We then visited (enriched and encouraged by) our friends in Woodinville, as we traditionally do every time we&#8217;re out there, and every time, we&#8217;re reluctant to leave.
Alas, the warm weather did not last, but held up enough so that when my dad&#8217;s car had a flat tire followed by a dead battery, I could take the baby out to the side of the road and wait &nbsp;&#8211; though we discovered that more people stopped because they saw me and the baby than when it was just j.w alone. And we all got sick, to the point where Bean developed hives and passed it to her cousin, and where I coughed so much coughed so much that the whole campsite heard me moan (dying cow?) in my sleep. We chickened out on the first day we were to set up camp (as it was damp and soggy and wouldn&#8217;t have helped my cold), and ended up joining our friends for 2 nights&nbsp;instead of 3. As it happens, we don&#8217;t generally hang out with too many families with young kids especially not all at once, so it took some time to get used to every child calling &#8220;mama, mama&#8221; and not wonder if it was Bean.
[caption id="attachment_5393" align="alignleft" width="739"]<img class="wp-image-5393 size-large" src="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/IMG_20160903_193553_hdr-1024x768.jpg" width="739" height="554" srcset="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/IMG_20160903_193553_hdr-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/IMG_20160903_193553_hdr-300x225.jpg 300w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/IMG_20160903_193553_hdr-768x576.jpg 768w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/IMG_20160903_193553_hdr-1568x1175.jpg 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 739px) 100vw, 739px" /> Car camping in cold and damp weather is worth it when the warm sun finally comes out (or sets in this case).[/caption]
Bean and her cousin had a blast together, despite some tears throughout. We ended up staying at their place for the duration of our trip, so that the cousins could spend extended time together, and because my mom didn&#8217;t want our sickly germs prior to their cruise trip two weeks later [ref]to the point where I think I only saw her 3 times during our entire 3 weeks there &#8211; she probably figured she&#8217;d see us upon the end of their cruise anyway[/ref]. We visited the PNE &#8211; I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve been there since high school (the year I entered in some art contest, where my friend, Marie won!- and I took honourable mention). Since it poured, we stayed covered in the farm / agriculture area, where the kids get to go through stations and collect a treat at the end. I discovered that Bean was either afraid or didn&#8217;t like the (plastic) fish in her bucket as she would bury it at the bottom or not want to touch anything touching it.&nbsp;A momma pig looked happy nursing her many piglets, which made me think of the bond&nbsp;between breastfeeding mothers and babies and how it seemingly universal it is (though I wonder if they get latch problems too).
Whether coincidentally or not, it seems that&nbsp;every time we visit my &#8220;home&#8221; church, major leadership changes happen: a pastor resigns or a new pastor comes on board; this time, they introduced a Chinese pastor &nbsp;and another&nbsp;English pastor announced his leave. In spite of the news, we both felt refreshed, as we were actually able to sit and listen to two sermons in a row, in its entirety without being interrupted by a baby (in the nursery) or a toddler (with her cousin and/or my sister in the toddler program). Furthermore, it was a series on marriage; a rare sermon topic at our church, likely because our demographics is mainly students. I don&#8217;t remember what it was about, except that we don&#8217;t pray as a married couple enough &#8211; but I&#8217;m guilty of not spending enough time with God one-on-one, so that would be a good place to start.&nbsp;
During our visit, j.w started 3 months of parental leave; I was elated[ref]While it would have been incredible had he chosen to taken all 37 weeks &#8211; after all, it&#8217;s not often that one gets such an opportunity&nbsp;&#8211; he only wanted to take&nbsp;one month of absence from work for family bonding. I get it &#8211; I&#8217;ve seen the how (terribly) mothers are treated when they come back to work after a year of maternity leave &#8211; to a new team, new leadership, into a new assigned role and (worse) desk, and being away for less time should prevent that from happening; he also fears knowledge loss. &nbsp;However,&nbsp;we managed to negotiate it to three in exchange that I would watch&nbsp;Star Wars: the Force Awakens with him[/ref]. &nbsp;His parental leave began in the middle into&nbsp;our trip, and would end with another trip (sandwiching a road trip with friends midway).
Bebe turned 9 months while we were visiting:


<ul>
    

<li>this was the&nbsp;start of self-feeding / baby-led weaning; he pursed his lips and refused any pureed food; instead, he took to ribs and other chunky food</li>


    

<li>we found out that not all kiddie toilet seats are created equal, and had to order one from Amazon, where the curved seat prevented him from arching his back every time we put him on, which affected his bowel movements</li>


    

<li>bum shifting became a means for mobility</li>


</ul>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				<![CDATA[Bebe has now spent more time outside of the womb than inside! I still&nbsp;marvel at the wonder of how Bebe managed to fit inside me and then the birthing&nbsp;process, which is only made possible through God's design and handiwork.
We're also almost halfway through my husband's three month parental leave, and I feel like we've accomplished nothing on our list, except travelling. However, it's definitely a huge blessing that he's home with the kids - taking them to the playground, putting one down for nap-time while I take the other, or letting me have some solo time or one-child time and he takes the other; the initial sacrifice of not having him around at the beginning is worth it, since the baby is in a much more interactive and fun stage. I'm thankful that our country allows the father to take up to 9 months off (without pay except EI unless your company tops it off), but few fathers I know take advantage of the allowance (citing income and/or knowledge/skill loss as the top two reasons). Though I wish that he took more time off, but it's already 2 more months than I expected - in exchange, I just need to watch Star Wars: the Force Awakens.
So, what have we learned about Bebe during the past two months?
This baby crosses legs at his ankles while sleeping or lying down and scratches his head when he's tired (a great visual cue!), but he's done that ever since I could remember. He's also decided to not take to the pacifier as readily now, either pawing away at it, turning his head, complaining, or spitting it out, either opting for no pacifier or his oft-preferred human pacifier (that would be yours truly - the human pacifier has milk&nbsp;and doesn't taste like silicone!).
Nine


<ul>
    

<li>Wave hello and knows how to shake his head from side to side (when I say yes and nod, he shakes his head no) &#8211; both of these are games to him, as well as him pulling up his legs and kicking them down on the bed; he also really likes a rhyme in my mother&#8217;s dialect, <em>hoi-ping</em>&nbsp;(the only sentences I still know)<em>&nbsp;</em></li>


    

<li>Yoga poses, bum shuffle, bum pivot</li>


    

<li>at the end of the 9 months, he pulled himself standing inside the crib</li>


</ul>


Ten


<ul>
    

<li>Discovering different syllables and repeating them: &#8220;ba&#8221; was the first repeated syllable, now repeated &#8220;da&#8221;s and sometimes &#8220;eh&#8221;s</li>


    

<li>Third tooth appears in the bottom left of his mouth</li>


    

<li>Standing up on stairs landing</li>


    

<li>&#8230;more to come</li>


</ul>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				<![CDATA[I cannot believe he's five months old already! I remember the first six months of Bean's life felt like a long time, but alas, #secondchildsyndrome; no wonder some moms with older kids miss the baby years. In a month's time, our lives will begin to get more complicated, when he becomes more mobile and starts solids and thus, smelly and poopy diapers that are no longer water-soluble.
#secondchildsyndrome means that he lacks dedicated one-on-one time with mom, resigning to being propped up on swing to observe what's going on around him (until he gets restless and complains). Some people have asked how our second one is, and he's still pretty chill in comparison to our first. My theory is because first-time moms are often more anxious when babe is still growing inside, but with subsequent pregnancies, they become more 'lax, so it somehow transfers to them. As parents, we're not supposed to compare our children - especially in front of them, but I can't help but say that there are definitely traits that the siblings share, but he's also very different from his sister:


<ul>
    

<li><strong>Similarities</strong>: they both had a phase where they disliked car rides, and let me tell you that driving with a crying baby is very stressful and makes for a very unpleasant ride for everyone (though the toddler&#8217;s coping mechanism seems to be singing to herself); they both battled a severe bought of eczema; when there are visual distractions around, they fall asleep faster and stay asleep longer with a breathable covering over their heads; a bald spot appeared on their back of their heads from shaking their heads back and forth vigorously on their sleeping surfaces; they now share the same size diapers</li>


    

<li><strong>Differences</strong>: he tolerates the swing; can fall asleep on his own fairly quickly when he is swaddled and has a pacifier; does not fall asleep much while breastfeeding and will finish a feed fairly quickly; he happily puts everything in his mouth (after all, he was pretty much born sucking on his hand, which means we might have to baby-proof the house which we didn&#8217;t have to worry about before); he is a heavy baby, chubs, with a big head (he&#8217;s now around 16-17 lbs) &#8211; thankfully that was of the boy and not the girl, and thankfully for the second, since my muscles are slightly used to the heavier first child</li>


</ul>


#secondchildsyndrome means that I almost missed some milestones, or failed to record them &#8211; including a lack of photos, especially photos with the entire family and me and him together:


<ul>
    

<li>lots of cooing still; he has discovered how to blow bubbles and figured out how to make a high-pitched squeal &#8211; which is amusing because his friend, just a couple of months older than him went through the same thing a few weeks ago (and he reminded her to blow bubbles again haha)</li>


    

<li>he knows how to reach up to play with toys &#8211; I put him in the play pen and I had dangled a toy off the mobile, and he reached up to play with it</li>


    

<li>he also managed to rotate 90 degrees in the playpen &#8211; probably by pushing his feet against the sides</li>


    

<li>tummy time is a bit easier for him now &#8211; he can hold his head up longer before complaining (instead of a face plant into the floor)</li>


    

<li>he can almost sit up like a tripod (bent forward toward his toes)</li>


    

<li>he sits up better in the bumbo these days, but he still tends to lean sideways shortly after he&#8217;s in</li>


    

<li>his sleep-cycle is more regular: 2 in the morning (30-40 min nap within 2 hours of the morning wake-up, then another 30-40 min nap 2 hours after that, usually around when we eat lunch thankfully), and 1 long nap in the afternoon (when toddler is sleeping &#8211; first by himself, and then with me feeding/holding him), a short nap just before or during dinner, and bed time around when the toddler sleeps</li>


</ul>


In toddler news, her current favourite colour is green and ESL English/Chinglish is picking up speed, despite a Chinese accent that accompanies it (though her English seems more whiny than her Chinese &#8211; not sure if it&#8217;s just the tone of voice). Her appetite is growing, and pan-fried, grandma-made potsticker dumplings are one of our favourite lunch meals right now, because she feeds herself &#8211; with chopsticks &#8211; for most of the meal, and she can eat up to 7 dumplings at a time! The other day, at her friend&#8217;s 5yo birthday party, she was one of the few younger ones who enjoyed following the dance teacher&#8217;s instructions &#8211; maybe it&#8217;s time to sign her up in some form of group lessons or activity soon.]]&gt;		</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				<![CDATA[A bittersweet proud mama moment.
Wow! After a little more than two and a half years, Bean is now naturally okay with me leaving the room before falling asleep - which leaves me with a little more free time in the evenings and some time in the afternoon when her brother is napping. &nbsp;She surprised me when&nbsp;she practically kicked me out during one of her naps when she heard her brother crying the other day, saying that I needed to feed him. Now, I tell her that I've forgotten to brush my teeth, she chimes in and tells me that I've forgotten to shower, and sends me away after I tuck her in and telling her she doesn't need to be scared, and leaving the door open a crack. After hearing my mother tell me that if I don't let her cry it out, then she will continue to need me until years later (like&nbsp;into school age), I wasn't quite prepared for this as she was still making sure to hug me closer when she heard her brother cry just a week or two ago, and then reluctantly let me go after I told her I would come back. We're on Day 3 - dare I&nbsp;hope that this will become a new routine that sticks?]]&gt;		</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				<![CDATA[To pee or not to pee, that is the question.
I sometimes wonder whether our toddler feels the urge to go at the most inconvenient times on purpose: in the middle of the meal, or when she's supposed to be falling asleep after lights out or during nap time. Of course, this prolongs either routine, and every time I take her, she does of course actually go. But when I ask her if she needs to go outside of those times, of course she doesn't (and won't). And then, there's this&nbsp;strange habit of sucking on her finger when she has the urge to go, which is a nice visual cue for me if I catch it, because she doesn't always tell me. Ah, the joys of toilet training (on her schedule instead of a 3 day boot camp schedule).
Woo-hoo! Today marks the first day that the baby fell asleep before the toddler's nap time and napped&nbsp;through the long excruciating process, leaving my hands free to pull tissues to wipe her tears and nose while trying to wait for her to fall asleep.
