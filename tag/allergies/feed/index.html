<p>Six months ago, our littlest had an IgE blood test: one nurse took his blood, the other stood by in case he needed to pin him down. I covered my son&#8217;s eyes, she took blood; he flinched at the poke, didn&#8217;t move until it was done and when asked by the nurse if it hurt, he answered, &#8220;nope,&#8221; and looked at them as if to say, &#8220;what, is it supposed to hurt?&#8221; Turns out, he did far better than some adults they&#8217;ve seen.</p>


<p>The report came back, and it was negative for milk, which suggested that  his chance of having an anaphylactic / severe allergic reaction to dairy was less than 25%. I was hopeful! After all, he had some accidental encounters with dairy a handful of times without severe reaction, but there&#8217;s the rub &#8211; his skin didn&#8217;t do as well, and reacted with the milk with the skin prick test . And, this is why you can&#8217;t rely on a blood test alone; that&#8217;s why an allergist has to consider the history of and individual (how they&#8217;ve responded to the allergen in the past) with a combination of tells before making a diagnosis.</p>


<p>When he finally weaned this summer, I happily jumped on the dairy bandwagon again &#8211; with a grilled cheese sandwich as the dairy product that I wanted to celebrate with first. Sadly, it was a variant of a jalapeno popper that wasn&#8217;t as satisfying as a grilled cheese would have been. A few weeks later, I noticed that the skin around my neck was starting to get red, patchy, and quite itchy at times; I&#8217;ve only had eczema around my neck once, and it was during my academic years, so I had figured it was stress induced.</p>


<p>Yet, it seemed to get better when I limited my dairy intake, but flared up again when I  threw caution to the wind over the holidays. I suspect it just might be my body responding to the reintroduction to dairy as some foreign matter. The allergist, in brief conversation, asked me if I was allergic to milk as a child. Why yes, I had recently discovered that while I knew my mother didn&#8217;t know I was allergic to milk until much later &#8212; even though I was vomiting after having any, I didn&#8217;t realize that the doctor didn&#8217;t suggest this to her until I was almost 3 years old! (that might explain why I don&#8217;t like milk now, even though I like many other dairy products). </p>


<p>I expect that if a naturopath confirmed my food sensitivities, she might recommend avoiding the foods that trigger an autoimmune response. Yet, the allergist recommended that if it was only a skin response, that I shouldn&#8217;t eliminate it completely, because he had found in his experience that if children cut out the foods in their diet, and then came into exposure with it down the road, the reaction ends up being a lot worse than before. This is what I wanted to hear, I suppose, because that means I can still have dairy &#8211; but perhaps in moderation.  My family doctor suspects it&#8217;s all related to the chronic skin conditions that I have elsewhere on my body, but I suppose one can never really know; all I know is that the skin is just a visible sign that something is awry with your autoimmune system &#8211; it might be your gut, might be something else inside</p>


<p>The allergist has given the green light to proceed with the oral challenge with the littlest next month, but in a hospital setting in case he needs treatment, so here&#8217;s to hoping &#8230;and praying &#8211; God knows what He&#8217;s doing!<br /></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				It&#8217;s been almost half a year since our little one&#8217;s first diagnosis of&nbsp;<a href="http://her.happyhippos.ca/2017/01/we-are-one-of-those-families/">his peanut and dairy allergy</a>, so here&#8217;s our first update and a few lessons I&#8217;ve learned:</p>
<ul>
<li>The allergist called me one Saturday afternoon, which surprised me as I thought doctors don&#8217;t work on weekends?&nbsp; He told that the&nbsp;blood results for&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioallergosorbent_test" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the RAST test</a> came back: DS&nbsp;would likely have a 50% chance of an anaphylactic reaction to milk, and a 90% chance of peanuts. So nope, not qualified to take the peanut challenge at this time.</li>
<li>He appears to be allergic to other tree nuts, but I&#8217;m not sure which one. How do I know? I fed him a mixed nut butter from Trader Joe&#8217;s which has the following ingredients:&nbsp;Almonds, Cashew Nuts, Walnuts, Brazil Nuts, Hazelnuts, Pecans, Sea Salt; he didn&#8217;t react the first time. The second time? Instant hives, which only went away after two doses of Benadryl.&nbsp;Our next appointment is not until the middle of summer, but at that appointment, we can test for further food allergies like goat&#8217;s milk protein, and the nuts, though I suspect it might be walnuts as it seems that it coincides with peanut allergies; he&#8217;s had almond milk before without any reaction, as well as almond in Chinese soup.</li>
<li>And as mom and son are refraining from nuts and dairy, I have&nbsp;noticed that Bean has asked for dairy items less &#8211; she wants his soy milk, and doesn&#8217;t ask for cheese, milk, or yogurt nearly as often as before</li>
<li>And as a mom refraining from nuts and dairy, I have failed him at least once &#8211; which I feel incredibly bad about. &nbsp;As my body can&#8217;t tell if I&#8217;ve ingested dairy or nuts, it&#8217;s only when he reacts that I&#8217;ve known that I had something I shouldn&#8217;t have had &#8211; specifically, the time when a friend made a special bowl of pasta for me knowing that I couldn&#8217;t have garlic or onions, but she had forgotten I wasn&#8217;t able to have cheese. I didn&#8217;t want to refuse it, so we decided to scrape off the top of it with the melted cheese and I would eat the rest of it. Bad idea. Within 30 minutes of breastfeeding, he threw up. Lesson learned: learn to get over feeling bad for inconveniencing people</li>
<li>Another lesson learned: Be skeptical. When someone tells you that a batch of homemade goodies they received from someone else are said to be safe, but it actually wasn&#8217;t, you learn that it&#8217;s okay not to trust what people tell you.</li>
<li>And, if anyone tells you that there is no such thing as dairy-free chocolate (as I&#8217;ve been told), it&#8217;s a myth; you can find dark chocolate / cocoa without milk, although many varieties&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fda.gov/ForConsumers/ConsumerUpdates/ucm433555.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">might come with a risk</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Dairy alternatives</h3>
<p>Unfortunately, I&#8217;ve noticed that&nbsp;I tend to crave for more sweets because I can&#8217;t readily have them anymore, so in my quest to search for sweets and treats that I can have, I&#8217;ve come to realize a few things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Many products that are nut and dairy-free tend to be vegan and gluten-free. I guess, it&#8217;s a better cost-benefit to sell&nbsp;a product that meets multiple-dietary needs than just one or two.</li>
<li>Be willing to pay a premium for anything that isn&#8217;t mainstream; this is true of organic products, and any specialty products like these</li>
<li>While I initially enthusiastically tried some dairy-free alternatives, I now am wary of trying most of them as I&#8217;ve only found one or two that didn&#8217;t have a strange texture or aftertaste:
<ul>
<li>The <a href="http://sodeliciousdairyfree.com/products/almond-milk-frozen-desserts/mocha-almond-fudge-bars" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mocha almond fudge</a>&nbsp;&#8220;ice-cream&#8221;&nbsp;bar by So Delicious is surprisingly good, President&#8217;s Choice coconut milk-based &#8220;ice cream&#8221; in chocolate and mango is good and affordable; I have yet to try coconut; and, Belasoy dark chocolate pudding is tasty too!</li>
<li>Soy yogurt, coconut yogurt, almond milk yogurt &#8211; strange texture and aftertaste, and unusually sweet if fruit flavoured <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f641.png" alt="🙁" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></li>
<li>Fake cheese, either blocks, shredded, or sliced &#8211; they tend to be okay together with something like melted on top of a burger, but terrible on its own or where it&#8217;s highlighted, like on nachos; I wouldn&#8217;t buy it again</li>
<li>I had forgotten that&nbsp;<a href="http://blog.fatfreevegan.com/2011/10/what-the-heck-is-nutritional-yeast.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">nutritional yeast</a> can be an interesting alternative to make popcorn taste cheesy</li>
<li>The most surprising finds yet:
<ul>
<li>while Oreo and Pillsbury croissants <em>are</em> dairy-free,</li>
<li>many types of margarine are <strong><em>not</em></strong> dairy-free; the ones that are contain artificial flavours, colour and other strange additives &#8211; the <a href="http://www.becel.ca/en/becel/becelproducts/becel-vegan.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">vegan one by Becel</a> is the one I ended up buying and using for baking, but I&nbsp;prefer using coconut oil on my toast now over margarine</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>My favourite stores? Organic Garage in Thornhill, for their discount breads and discount milk alternatives when they&#8217;re close to expiry; and locally,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.cefoodexperience.ca/?page_id=29" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ce Food Experience and Bakery</a> where&nbsp;I encountered the most wonderful nut-free, dairy-free apple pie; her partner has multiple allergies, so they have a selection of safe treats to choose from, and <a href="http://www.sevenshores.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Seven Shores</a> for their vegan menu options (including vegan cheese and ease of subbing avocado for mayo for example) and baked treats (sometimes $1 day-olds).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>The UX of Labels</h3>
<p>I&#8217;m used to reading labels to see if a product has garlic, onion, etc. and how high and the sodium content on the nutritional value chart, but when I&#8217;m specifically looking for allergens, it&#8217;s so much easier when companies decide to highlight them. Here are a few design choices that I&#8217;ve encountered:</p>

</ul>
<h4>And then, there&#8217;s the&nbsp;possibility that the product <em>might</em> contain a common allergen</h4>
<p><figure id="attachment_5681" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5681" style="width: 225px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipOnzRsfAoOR8UgSfTQi-pwSnOOWUISg8KMmJg3dBG8A81LetmyqRGJ8FMXxLn6hIg/photo/AF1QipPZEFVH7X6oEm2yBf7jJY7MBjKicmFrmuI5ubXC?key=c19hQmJWSlZhdXRENGdpWnU4d1lhRXBXOURVWG1n"><img class="wp-image-5681 size-medium" src="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_20170218_202116374-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300" srcset="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_20170218_202116374-225x300.jpg 225w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_20170218_202116374.jpg 738w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-5681" class="wp-caption-text">An oxymoron: these cookies are dairy-free, but watch out, they&#8217;re made in a facility that uses dairy&#8230;</figcaption></figure><br />
I have a love-hate relationship with the disclaimer on a product that tells me that it&nbsp;<em>may</em> contain an ingredient that isn&#8217;t listed, or that it&#8217;s processed in a facility or shared-equipment that uses those ingredients. This information&nbsp;is not regulated, and instead seems to&nbsp;be&nbsp;<a href="http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/fn-an/label-etiquet/allergen/precaution_label-etiquette-eng.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">volunteered information</a>&nbsp;&#8211; aimed to help consumers (but&nbsp;allows companies to cover their butts I&#8217;d say); it&#8217;s definitely important to know that a certain product may have been in contact&nbsp;with an allergen, but this information becomes useless in situations where the label isn&#8217;t helpful anymore.<br />
It does help when the labels tell me to consult the website for more information, or straight up <a href="http://sodeliciousdairyfree.com/allergen-information" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tells me&nbsp;what they do</a>&nbsp;on the label to make sure that there isn&#8217;t any cross contamination. If it&#8217;s made in-store, I often find that if I talk to the department in-person or call them, I can decide if I&#8217;m comfortable with their methods of cleaning, etc.&nbsp;I have come to trust[ref]perhaps foolishly especially knowing that this label is volunteered info[/ref]&nbsp;that if a certain brand of food always uses the &#8220;may contain&#8221; label, if this is absent in a product, I take to mean that there are no known possible contaminants.<br />
But, two labels come to mind that have thrown me in for a loop:</p>
<ul>
<li>This box of cookies that have a giant list of allergens that they&#8217;re free from, yet down below in smaller print, it says: &#8220;Made in a facility that uses dairy&#8221; so now, a little doubt creeps in over the credibility of the &#8220;dairy-free&#8221; claim.</li>
<li>Costco&#8217;s rotisserie&nbsp;chicken&#8217;s label tells me that it may contain ALL of the top allergens it seems: wheat, fish, milk, eggs, soy, shellfish, crustaceans, tree nuts, sesame, mustard. REALLY? So, I called our local Costco, and spoke to someone from the meat department who prepares these chickens, and he told me that they prepare the chicken in the raw meat room, so the only risk would be fish (shellfish, crustaceans, etc.). <em>Thank you</em>. I guess you can say everything that isn&#8217;t packaged in the store might be cross contaminated if they prepare food in an open bakery, but I don&#8217;t see bags of apples with those labels&#8230;</li>
</ul>
<p>I&#8217;ve started taking <a href="https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipOnzRsfAoOR8UgSfTQi-pwSnOOWUISg8KMmJg3dBG8A81LetmyqRGJ8FMXxLn6hIg?key=c19hQmJWSlZhdXRENGdpWnU4d1lhRXBXOURVWG1n" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">photos of labels that&nbsp;I&#8217;ve come across</a> as a digital artifact collection of sorts &#8211; you&#8217;re welcome to add to it.		</p>
