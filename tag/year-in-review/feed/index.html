								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				<![CDATA[The one word that best describes 2015?&nbsp;<em>Life</em>


<h3>The old has gone&#8230;</h3>


2015 was when the life of our house starts to show; the year that our house breaks down (actually both of them do). Whether you rent or own, there&#8217;s the everyday and the occasional deep cleaning you need to do to&nbsp;up-keep&nbsp;the place, but when you own, there&#8217;s more at stake.


<h4>The yard</h4>




<ul>
    

<li>From previous years:&nbsp;<strong>Patio</strong> needs work and repair &#8211; sealing, paint, and replacing some rotted planks (unresolved)</li>


    

<li><strong>Fence&nbsp;door / gate</strong> falls off its hinges. Our neighbour&#8217;s gate also had that happen to her sometime later; ours got fixed, but hers is still broken (we should&nbsp;help her get hers up again)</li>


</ul>




<h4>The kitchen</h4>




<ul>
    

<li><strong>Oven</strong>:&nbsp;has more and more mini-explosions (I think still unresolved after some attempts at cleaning it)</li>


    

<li><strong>Microwave</strong>: would randomly&nbsp;stop working mid-cycle&nbsp;and would have to unplug and plug it back to reboot it. By the end of the year, I finally decided to redeem airmiles for a smaller, more stylish &#8211; and functional &#8211; microwave</li>


    

<li><strong>Kitchen light</strong>: In June or July, it stops working. First one bulb would turn on only on occasion or it would take hours before it would turn on, then eventually the three bulbs&nbsp;stopped powering on right away. Eventually, &nbsp;my father-in-law manages to revive two of the three bulbs and it has worked like that since.</li>


    

<li>In July, we find an abundance of <strong>fruit flies</strong>, from a bag of molding carrots and beets that our housemate left behind and then some <strong>plant gnats</strong> in our indoor basil and single window plant (seems to be all gone now, phew)</li>


    

<li>That same month, the&nbsp;<strong>air conditioning</strong> stops blowing cool air in the middle of a heat wave; it would&nbsp;work again when you turned it off, wait a bit, and then back on. Upon further investigation, the external unit stopped working when it became encased in ice, which explained why it worked fine the&nbsp;AC didn&#8217;t&nbsp;need to be turned on for a long time. The technician added some coolant and tried a couple of other tricks to prolong its life, but we ultimately replaced it late August / early September.</li>


</ul>




<h4>The basement</h4>




<ul>
    

<li>A month earlier, in&nbsp;June: the <strong>basement</strong> floods from a torrential, sideways down-pour of rain (happened and stopped within 1 hour); it seems the water seeped through the window from an overflowing window well that didn&#8217;t drain properly (two likely factors: drain got buried without us knowing; and,&nbsp;our windows are bigger, which makes them&nbsp;lower to the ground). At least our friend had good use of the basement for 5 months. Thankfully, the&nbsp;dry wall seems in tact and we have a sunken basement so flood was relatively contained and we only need to replace the laminate floor boards in that one area, and there doesn&#8217;t seem to be any mold damage. Ridiculously, our insurance told us&nbsp;that they wouldn&#8217;t cover our house&nbsp;anymore if we didn&#8217;t get it repaired even though they also said &#8220;seepage&#8221; wasn&#8217;t covered anyway.</li>


    

<li>Fast forward a few months, in September, our <strong>other basement</strong> floods. As a result, the ugly green carpet is removed in no time, and we discover a mysterious hole under the bar area (where the sump pump was once, perhaps?). The water comes through a side wall, and we later realize it was because the sump pump failed and the water was probably from a combination of rain and the neighbour watering the grass at the side of the house.&nbsp;Insurance estimates the damage to be at least 10K, but&nbsp;doesn&#8217;t&nbsp;cover it either as j.w didn&#8217;t realize he had to specifically request coverage for it (I made sure our house had it)</li>


</ul>




<h4>The bedroom</h4>




<ul>
    

<li><strong>Ceiling</strong>: we find a streak&nbsp;of water mark&nbsp;other than the patch&nbsp;from the ice storm years ago. A few months later, when we got an&nbsp;insulation consultation, the guy explains that it&#8217;s from condensation from a lack of insulation, reassuring us that it&#8217;s not actually our roof that&#8217;s leaking (and that it still has a good few years of life left and that lighter colour shingles take less wear than darker ones)</li>


    

<li><strong>Mattress</strong>: at the end of my pregnancy, I realized that I sagged into my mattress, and rotating it didn&#8217;t help. Upon further inspection, I noticed two distinct imprints / indents that didn&#8217;t go away. We took a chance on a $270 box spring+mattress deal at the beginning of 2016 from Sears and it&#8217;s already feeling a lot better.</li>


</ul>

<h3>&#8230;the new has come</h3>




<div>&nbsp;2015 was also the year where many things took on new life: <a href="http://her.happyhippos.ca/2015/11/zoom-zoom/">a car</a>, the addition of&nbsp;extended family members (two&nbsp;<a href="http://her.happyhippos.ca/2015/07/california-road-trip/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">weddings</a>), <a href="http://her.happyhippos.ca/2015/12/its-another-baby/">a baby</a>&nbsp;(and answered prayers of friends who have tried and are finally expecting!), and new friendships outside of our church community &#8211;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.75;">especially this one crazy reconnection&#8230;</span></div>




<div>&nbsp;</div>




<div>&#8230;As a UXer (<em>think that&#8217;s a made up word), </em>I like to stay connected with the community and the industry by keeping up with the&nbsp;monthly meetups in our local UX group. However, I think I recall only going to two events in the past two plus years &#8211; so when the meetup.com description mentioned a name of a speaker I thought I recognized, I signed up to attend!&nbsp;Sure enough, she was someone I knew from my high school days, <em>all the way from BC</em>&nbsp;&#8211; we had volunteered together at a science camp for kids at SFU one summer, and for some reason, I remembered her (I only remember her name, 2 campers, and one other person I knew). Who knew that fast forward two plus decades,&nbsp;we would&nbsp;meet again on the other side of the country, and that we&#8217;re both in the same industry and play board games? (come to think of it, the other volunteer that I knew is an active board gamer too). Because of her, we&#8217;ve been introduced to her high school and university friend (who has also settled here) and his family, and so now we know another couple with kid(s) and Bean has another friend / playmate closer to her age than our friends (they also happen&nbsp;to&nbsp;know another set of our friends via their daughter&#8217;s school and the wife&#8217;s profession); God sure knows who to send at the right time!</div>




<div>&nbsp;</div>




<div>&nbsp;</div>




<div>So why am I only writing this now? Well, I started it mid-year but didn&#8217;t get a chance to finish until today, so as j.w says, it&#8217;s the yearly review, lunar year style. Happy lunar new year &#8211; &nbsp;I&nbsp;look forward to seeing what 2016 will bring us!</div>




<div>&nbsp;</div>




<div>(PS. And here&#8217;s Jetpack&#8217;s <a href="http://jetpack.me/annual-report/47004674/2015/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">year in review for this blog&#8217;s stats</a>, though&nbsp;it&#8217;s not smart enough to figure out that the&nbsp;top three commenters is actually the same&nbsp;person)&nbsp;</div>
