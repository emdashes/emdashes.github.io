								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In my head, this feels so surreal, so artificial, so much like a production. All this planning and rehearsing, like a play. I think I will be going through the motions and just forcing myself to enjoy most of it (I don&#8217;t like being in the centre of attention, nor am I any good at acting any longer). As a child, I used to love acting and participating in plays, musical productions, and interpretative (creative) dance, but I&#8217;m not sure what happened over the years to move me away from that shell.</p>
<p>The biggest production of my lifetime is bringing people closer than I would have ever expected. Imagine my mother&#8217;s surprise when I told her that one of my friends said that his mother knows her from high school. They had lost contact and when his mother had seen the invitation, she recognized my mother&#8217;s Chinese name! (in Chinese, it is common practice to include the surname) What are the odds? My mother now lives on the other side of the country, and my friend&#8217;s mother in the GTA. They&#8217;ll be seeing each other in less than two weeks&#8217; time. I can&#8217;t picture what it will be like to meet my high school friend in 30 plus years and seeing them again at their child&#8217;s wedding, but they&#8217;re sure excited.</p>
<p>On a unrelated note, my mother gave me a skirt that she bought in HK many years ago. Just the other day, I realized that a friend of mine had the exact same skirt! She bought it in Hong Kong years ago too &#8211; the strangest thing is that she and I have this similar fish pouch too that we both got from China.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The majority of the weddings that I have attended to date have been Chinese Christian (Protestant) weddings. Or so I thought. Instead, after being to a wedding in Hong Kong (last year), I have come to think that Chinese Christian weddings in Canada are westernized!
</p>
<p>In Hong Kong:</p>
<ul>
<li>The bridesmaids, with the exception of the maid of honour, sit down for the duration of the ceremony. Only the maid of honour goes through the procession and sits at the head table. These bridesmaids (&#8220;sisters&#8221;) are essentially what we know as helpers. Same with groomsmen. The helpers&#8217; roles include registration table, assistant to maid of honour, move gifts/bags, etc. They do, however, participate in the bride games. Here in North America, the bridesmaids join the bride and the maid of honour in everything: standing up front, sitting at the head table, etc. and leave the helping to the helpers!</li>
<li>The wedding song (bridal march) is played throughout the procession. In North America, should the couple choose to use it, is only played for the bride and groom, and not the rest of the wedding party</li>
<li>It does not appear to be a tradition for the bridesmaid(s)/maid of honour/best man/groomsmen to make a speech at the dinner, nor the couple to do a first dance.</li>
<li>The garter toss was not done either (but I&#8217;ve seen North American weddings skip out on that) and the bridal bouquet is tossed outside the church after the ceremony to the &#8220;sisters&#8221; (bridesmaids).</li>
<li>Chinese Christian brides have their hair combed the night before, to wish blessings on the new bride (might happen with traditional families here)</li>
<li>The head table is great. That is, there IS no head table! (well no long one across the stage, but a round table on the same level as the guests)</li>
<li>No embarrassing couple games and no dancing <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></li>
<li>Prior to being married, the official status of a man is &#8220;Bachelor&#8221;; for a woman, the title is &#8220;Spinster&#8221;. I kid you not.</li>
<li>Dinner begins at 9 PM. In the afternoon, guests just come in to play MJ (mahjong) until dinner time, but appetizers are served to hold them over.</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, I have only been to 1 wedding in Hong Kong, so that might just influence my impressions of a true Chinese Christian wedding. <a href="http://www.twitter.com/youngvo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@youngvo</a>: this is for you. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Life has really taken me away from blogging regularly, even though I want to blog about it, but by the time I have time to sit down, I don&#8217;t.</p>
<p>The other day, I was remarking to people that getting guests to RSVP to confirm their attendance is like pulling teeth. By the RSVP deadline, we had confirmed numbers below the required minimum, which reminded me of a parable that Jesus told (<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2014:%2015-24;&#038;version=31;" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">as recorded in Luke 14:15-24</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;A certain man was preparing a great banquet and invited many guests. At the time of the banquet he sent his servant to tell those who had been invited, &#8216;Come, for everything is now ready.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;But they all alike began to make excuses. The first said, &#8216;I have just bought a field, and I must go and see it. Please excuse me.&#8217; &#8220;Another said, &#8216;I have just bought five yoke of oxen, and I&#8217;m on my way to try them out. Please excuse me.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;Still another said, &#8216;I just got married, so I can&#8217;t come.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;The servant came back and reported this to his master. Then the owner of the house became angry and ordered his servant, &#8216;Go out quickly into the streets and alleys of the town and bring in the poor, the crippled, the blind and the lame.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Sir,&#8217; the servant said, &#8216;what you ordered has been done, but there is still room.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then the master told his servant, &#8216;Go out to the roads and country lanes and make them come in, so that my house will be full. I tell you, not one of those men who were invited will get a taste of my banquet.'&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Imagine what it would be like to invite the homeless and strangers to the party? It probably was a blast for those people, but this man must have been frustrated as well. If he was, I can completely identify.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				For those who may need accommodations while in the Toronto area, we have some options for you:<br />
We have blocked some rooms (2 queen sized beds per room for 4) at the <a href="http://www.hiexmarkham.ca" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Holiday Inn Express Hotel &#038; Suites</a> at a discounted rate of <strike>$118.95</strike> $99 CDN+tax with free parking and breakfast. The rate is guaranteed for the dates between September 11 and 13, 2009 and the rooms are reserved until <strike>August 21</strike> August 11, 2009. You can reserve it online or under our names (Group code: EJF) without placing a hold on your credit card until then.<br />
We have also secured pricing for rooms at the <a href="http://www.hilton.com/en/hi/groups/personalized/YYZAPHF-WLW-20090911/index.jhtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hilton Suites Toronto/Markham Conference Centre and Spa</a> nearby from $125 a night (depending on the room). These are suites, which means you have a bedroom area and a living room area. Overnight parking costs about $12, but with your reservation, you have the option to choose either free parking or a breakfast buffet that&#8217;s valued at $18 for two. Each extra adult guest in a room may cost about $20 night.<br />
For either of the above two, please confirm the cancellation policy but from what I have been told on the phone, you need to give the standard advanced notice of cancellation at least 24 hours before arrival without any penalty.<br />
For the budget conscious folks, you can try the Residence and Conference Centre nearby. Their rates are $74.95+tax per night for a 2 bedroom suite (double bed in each one) with shared bathroom and kitchenette. However, because students are returning in September, availability may be limited so they have advised me to call back in mid-August to check for room availability at a group rate of $69.95+tax a night. So, if you&#8217;re interested in this option, please leave a comment so that we know whether to pursue this alternative.		</p>
