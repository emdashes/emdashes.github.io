					<description><![CDATA[Hi zuma,
Good question! For the all-you-can-eat places that I know of, most of them don&#039;t have sashimi for lunch, unless you order it a-la-carte (at least I haven&#039;t found one yet).
But, in terms of &quot;best and cheap&quot; ayce sashimi, most places are pretty comparable (with my preference being either Nara Sushi or Sushi Boat, and maybe Sushi Stars) But, if you don&#039;t mind paying two dollars more for your meal, I would go to Sushi Feast in Cambridge for their sashimi as their quality seems better.]]></description>
