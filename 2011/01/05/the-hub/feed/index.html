					<description><![CDATA[Oh photos to accompany the crab story! :D Wheeee they look HUGE! I keep having to remind myself they&#039;re not like the tiny blue crabs we eat in October. It&#039;s also pretty cool that your Dad&#039;s cousin&#039;s daughter had videos of her grandma! I wonder how common it is to catch home videography of the older generations ...or keep them in such good condition to be viewed now :) Ah, our home videos will be gold in 80 years&#039; time haha!]]></description>
