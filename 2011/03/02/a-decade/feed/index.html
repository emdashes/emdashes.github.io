					<description><![CDATA[@DX: most of my friends&#039; blog have all died, and yours is probably the few left that hasn&#039;t changed!
The feed should still have still worked since my old domain still works, but I guess something died. I guess now you can update your Google Reader :) (though Chrome is complaining about my feed, so I&#039;ll have to take a look-see sometime).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Happy 10th Anniversary!
When I think about blogging (haha) you always come to mind-- a lifer, I feel like my &#039;blog self&#039; has appreciated your &#039;blog self&#039; &#039;s companionship these many years, if that makes any sense.
I&#039;ll be celebrating my blog&#039;s 10th anniversary this year as well, and though it&#039;s really &#039;not the same&#039; anymore, one of the most rewarding things about it all is the ability to look over the years at a true representation of your own journey of self. A documentation of your own coming of age. And before I turn your comments into my own blog entry, thank you for sheepie.net, the place I&#039;m pretty sure inspired a 14 year old me to start writing it all down. xo]]></description>
