The weekend was awesome! Melody and I got a ride from my supervisor from work to Ottawa in a  Hyundai Accent. Ironic that the driver rarely signals, even though he was once a driving instructor. But, he was kind enough to only charge us for gas (total $20) and drove Mel to and from ‘Sauga :)! The ride there took about 6 hours (excluding 1 hr for lunch (Swiss Chalet) in Belleville), but because there was traffic from Kingston to Toronto, the ride back was an exceedingly long 8 hours w/o a long stop.
</p>



<p>
When we finally arrived, we headed out to Chinatown to eat dinner at…Man’s Kitchen. heh. Marc had to do prestudy, so J, Mel, and I had the usual stuff there. ‘cept Mel and I weren’t too hungry b/c we had lunch late (14h30). After loitering at the church, waiting for Marcy, we dropped Derrick’s cell off in Centrepointe, and the went to Poon’s to play some “board games” (which ended up to be video console games for some after awhile)–BoGGLE and Dutch Blitz. I haven’t played Blitz in sooo long :). Tho’ Mel and I weren’t “hungry”, Dom, J, Mel, and I went to Elgin Street Diner to have some food/dessert. I had a yummy piece of Triple Chocolate Cheesecake. I love cheesecake (yes, even tho i am lactose intolerant). Dom treated us all! Thanks Dom :).
</p>



<p>
By then, I was about to collapse b/c I was so tired (only mustered 3 hrs of sleep the night before because of an assignment that I wanted to finish before going away for the weekend). However, Mel and I stayed up talking til about 5:00 am, and although I had 3 hours of sleep again, she didn’t get a wink at all (new environment, etc.)! She said that it was one of the longest 3 hrs of her life :(.
</p>



<p>
Gettin up early to take a shower in a very ghetto bathroom was a very hard thing to do, especially when the toilet doesn’t flush properly. But, we got outta the house by 9 AM (in which I woke up J, but I left him be after the agonizing pain of tiredness he seemed to be in), and headed toward Parliament Hill. Interestingly enough, the place wasn’t packed and we didn’t haveta wait for the next tour. Additionally, this time, they didn’t find my swiss army knife in my bag, which is very odd. For my 2nd English tour, and my 3rd tour overall, I still learned something new: the stones on the walls are fossilized and are from Manitoba! if one looks carefully, one can see some fossil imprints remaining in the outer surfaces of the walls. And, you know how I thought that one of the portraits was stolen in a fire or something? Well, in reality, one of the paintings were cut out and saved when the Parliament burnt down–must be my poor understanding of French.. 🙂
</p>



<p>
After the tour, we headed over to the Canadian Mint to book a reservation for 3:30 PM (b/c it was then quite full). As Mel and I were quite hungry, after showing her some of the neat stores that were along Sussex, we had lunch at my fav restaurant in the Market area, The Blue Cactus–yes, I like their food (quantity and quality) for their price and the atmosphere. Soon before we finished, Dom dropped by and waited for us to clear out before taking us to the Fall Rhapsody in Gatineau Park. The trees were really nice (tho’ I don’t get why it’s such an “in” thing here as it’s almost like Spring or Fall at Burnaby Mountain).
</p>

<p>
I finally get to finish my update! We bumped into Ma-chew and S’ree as they headed to seek out Nate and Viv. Apparently, they bumped into them 1/4 into the trails since they went counter-direction-wise to them. But, we couldn’t stay b/c of the Cdn Mint tour. They apparently spelled Singapore wrong in one of their displays, and since it’s really getting to me that they’d have such a blatant spelling mistake, I e-mailed them just now. HA :).  Apparently, I hum a lot. I notice that too now that Mel has pted it out over the weekend :). Ah wells. Music is everything, as DD once pted out: w/o music, one would not be as easily moved to do anything. Shortly after the tour (in which a 50-cent coin wasn’t actually face value, but twice of what it is), Dom suggested that we go to Piccolo Grande! Yum!, I totally forgot about gelato in Ottawa :). As we waited for Josh to show, we eached enjoyed a cup full (Papaya and Mango for me! :þ). As appetites go, dessert came before dinner. We ended up at  Canal Ritz, which is this lil restaurant on Rideau Canal. The portions are not too bad. For a small size (they have large too), the food is sure filling! Thankfully, we made it on time for Elijah (even though they started characteristically late). There was some lack of organisation, but when things finally started going, they progressed into a Bible Study on “Knowing God”. Quite interesting. Unfortunately, we had “dessert” at Chu-Shing b/c apparently MK was really humid. I say unfortunately b/c there’s never anything good to eat there. Mel and I had a really hard time getting up the next morning for church. Thankfully, Mel had some sleep that night (as opposed to the first), but I think both of us had a hard time being attentive to PDjr. I do remember that the sermon had to do with Thanksgiving tho :P.
</p>



<p>
Shao (i have never met him before), Matt’s friend from UW, treated Mel and I for lunch as the 4 of us ate pho at Tu Du (or something like that). Unfortunately, it was raining that day, so we kinda got wet. Fortunately for us, Marc’s dad drove us to South Keys so that we didn’t have to take the bus and get wet. Ma-Chew and S’ree (hmm, I make it sound like they’re a couple in this entry) joined us at Cineplex before Jonah:A Veggie Tales Movie began. For those that have yet to see it, STAY for the credits and pay attention :). I think that was the second movie that I actually closed my eyes in–Marc and Mel too I think. We were all so tired. However, my ears were still wide open so I didn’t miss anything :). The whole theatre comprised of kids and their parents. We were the only ones that didn’t have kids or our parents there :P. Thx to Marc for the movie :).
</p>



<p>
Took Mel on the OCTranspo because we had to bus to Orlèans as we had an invitation to the Thanksgiving dinner that Marc’s family provided. Yum. I was really full afterwards and the three of us were falling asleep. By the time we got home, that’s what we did :). Woke up early, went to the Market for postcards and a <a href="http://www.beavertailsinc.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BeaverTail</a> 🙂 Had a REALLY quick lunch at Medieo Bistro (i thk that’s what its called). They serve Greek-ish food at somewhat of a high price but the food is really good. I ordered a 1/2 rack of lamb on greens and I rushed the order. Well, it came out in 10 mins! A lil on the rare side for me, but still edible :). I think if we weren’t pressed for time, we would’ve thoroughly enjoyed the atmosphere, food, service :).
</p>



<p>
And here, is where I begun my entry. :).
</p>



<p>
I forgot to mention that on the drive back, Todd took us down Sussex Drive, to places where ambassadors and embassys were, and also to the home of the ex-president of Corel. His house is soooo cold. It’s all gold/copper, very “square-ish”, and has a feel of an institution. Too bad that it didn’t occur to me to take a picture. I guess it’s very modern and contemporary, if you can call it that–reflective of some of the company’s products/logos (as in graphix not logic), or even ethos perhaps?</p>
