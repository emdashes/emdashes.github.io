					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;oh just to reply to your comment, yah I doubt you can get the green tea frap with soy milk b/c the base mixture comes premade with non-fat milk (i think it comes in milk bags)... but customizing with no whip(cream) on the top and no syrup and an extra scoop of powder should be doable, usually the baristas are really accomodating... like one of my friends he got a frap and thought it was too sweet and the barista made him a brand new one for free twice (the second time it wasnt sweet enough)...&lt;/p&gt;]]></description>
