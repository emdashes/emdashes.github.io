					<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t think Paul is explicitly identified as the author within the book of Hebrews - it could have been Paul - but whoever the author is, he/she chose to remain anonymous, probably due to the emphasis on the speaking of the Son today, Heb 1:2 (&quot;Listen to Jesus, not me!&quot;).
The promise &#039;He who is coming will come and will not delay&#039; originates from Habakkuk 2:3, so the people of God had waited several centuries already even before the first coming of Jesus. So talk about waiting!
&quot;What is faith? It is the confident assurance that what we hope for is going to happen. It is the evidence of things we cannot yet see,&quot; (Heb 11:1-2 NLT) even if we do not see it happen in our lifetime.
Keep trusting...]]></description>
