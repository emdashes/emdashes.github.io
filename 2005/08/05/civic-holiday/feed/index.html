					<description><![CDATA[Even though I&#039;m in engineering, everyone else in my family are in the life-sciences.
My folks are both PhD&#039;s in biology, and they also have a 97 year-old colleague, Dr. Hu, who was the first female PhD student to graduate from Harvard. Her specialisation is in botany.
But I just found out you could have found the necessary info from http://www.answers.com   Type &quot;myrtle&quot; and you will find a reference to &quot;guava&quot; somewhere in the page.
I guess if we know how to use the Internet, we can all become experts. :P]]></description>
