					<description><![CDATA[Oh, forgot to mention.  If the larvae pupate, then they will be pretty much impervious to chemicals--at that point you either kill them by hand, or wait them out.

					<description><![CDATA[Oh come on.  Maggots are one of the most wonderful creatures I know of--probably even better than leaches.  Maggot Debridement Therapy is just plain nifty, as are most forms of &#039;biosurgery&#039;.
http://www.ucihs.uci.edu/com/pathology/sherman/home_pg.htm
Granted, I still wouldn&#039;t be happy to have them running wild around my house ;-) And, you probably just have housefly larvae instead of Blow fly larvae, so it isn&#039;t quite as nifty.  And the Screwworm larvae is just plain evil, but that&#039;s getting off-topic.
The problem should be largely self-solving, if you are willing to wait two weeks.  Eventually they will become flies, and fly away.  Just clean up the food.  Raid should work--they are just insects afterall.
This article might help too.
http://www.bugspray.com/article/maggots.html
If you want to get creative, try using water an dishsoap--might drown them.  I know it works with bees.  The soap breaks the surface tension of the water, and allows it to cover the insect, drowning it.  I don&#039;t know if it&#039;ll work on larvae.
Good luck, and good hunting!
