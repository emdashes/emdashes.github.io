1 : the depiction of erotic behavior (as in pictures or writing) intended to cause sexual excitement&lt;br /&gt;
2 : material (as books or a photograph) that depicts erotic behavior and is intended to cause sexual excitement&lt;br /&gt;
3 : the depiction of acts in a sensational manner so as to arouse a quick intense emotional reaction)]]></description>
