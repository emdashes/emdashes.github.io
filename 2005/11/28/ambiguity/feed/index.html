					<description><![CDATA[hrmm... that would explain u nearly backing into the garden last nite.
from an English POV, &#039;than they appear&#039; implies not reality, and in this case &#039;not reality&#039; implies mirror.  Also, &#039;are&#039; implies a certain reality.  So, in essence, it says the objects shown in the mirror, in reality, are closer than how the mirror shows it.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[aiya...isn&#039;t this the kind of stuff you RPW people write?  hahaha, i never really thought of that as ambiguous, i&#039;ve always understood it to be the second state you mentioned - the Objects are closer THAN they appear.
makes sense in context too, since it&#039;s sort of like a caution label.  they&#039;re closer than you think, so watch out!]]></description>
