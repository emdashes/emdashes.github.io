					<description><![CDATA[Tough to say about the Extended Warranty.  Essentially 4 extra years at $300 each year, so you&#039;re betting that you&#039;d have at least $100 worth of something go wrong every 4 months on average.  Maybe you&#039;d be better off putting $25 a month into a good bank account.  I guess it depends on what the warranty covers.

					<description><![CDATA[There was a bit about this on &quot;Olsen on Your Side&quot; a few weeks/months back.
It was mentioned that getting rust proofing externally (e.g., from Macco) was usually better in terms of quality  and price =)
Oh, a Consumer Reports link for you...
