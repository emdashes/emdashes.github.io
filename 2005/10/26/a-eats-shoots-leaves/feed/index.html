					<description><![CDATA[New heaven and New earth!  So I wouldn&#039;t make it seem like heaven is going to become earth.  It&#039;s more like everything will be redefined.  Since Heaven is relative to Earth.  But if Heaven is where we live.  Than essentially Heaven becomes our new earth.
Yep, we gotta use scripture to understand scripture.  Hmm to be honest I wouldn&#039;t be surprised if Heaven doesn&#039;t exist in our time line. Because if God lives in heaven, and God is outside time... then... heaven would be outside time as well no?  So there is no today or tomorrow in heaven.  Hence the point is moot.     ]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In majority of the cases, the placement of punctuation is self-evident. Only in very rare cases do they make substantial differences. And even so, a full-blown doctrine does not rely on one single verse.
As for the reference to thief and paradise, neither of the variations contribute to the Catholic idea of purgatory.
Even Protestants have different ideas about our &quot;intermediate state&quot; (the state between our deaths and our resurrection).
My view is that &quot;paradise&quot; here should not be equated with the common conception of &quot;heaven&quot;. It is rather referring to our intermediate state.
And by the way, you will never find direct scriptural references about us &quot;going to heaven&quot; after we die.
To use strictly biblical terms, upon our deaths, we await our future resurrection. That will happen at the Lord&#039;s coming. The Bible speaks of the new city, New Jerusalem, coming down &quot;from heaven to EARTH,&quot; and we shall be in the &quot;new heaven and new EARTH.&quot;
In other words, the eternal kingdom that Jesus is going to establish is actually on earth, not heaven! The second coming (or &quot;parousia&quot;) is actually the time when finally heaven meets earth. Our conventional use of the term &quot;heaven&quot; is not strictly biblical (&quot;After I die, I go to heaven&quot;).]]></description>
