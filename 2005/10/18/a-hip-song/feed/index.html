					<description><![CDATA[Sex makes pretty much anything popular.  Sex itself is pretty popular--there does happen to be around 6 billion of us, due in no small part to sex&#039;s popularity.
But it is just fantasy--I haven&#039;t met anyone who&#039;s life actually approaches what is portrayed in the media.  I figure it&#039;s popular for the same reason that any fantasy is--you can safely explore (vicariously) a life that you can&#039;t (or wouldn&#039;t even particularly want to) have.
Have to disagree about pride being the problem.  Sometimes it seems like the problem is more a lack of pride.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[it&#039;s interesting that this song embodies the concept of feminine empowerment that our culture is currently headed towards.  From shows like &quot;Sex and the City&quot; and the feminist movement, people are believing more and more that hedonism is most important, and seeking our own pleasure is the ultimate goal in life, and promiscuity is just another way to get pleasure.  This whole movement stems from pride, the belief that we are the most important being in existence and all else exists to satisfy us.  Giving up the self, this pride, is one of the hardest things for anyone to do.]]></description>
