		<p>				his peanut and dairy allergy, so here’s our first update and a few lessons I’ve learned:


</p><ul><li>The allergist called me one Saturday afternoon, which surprised me as I thought doctors don’t work on weekends?  He told that the blood results for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioallergosorbent_test" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the RAST test</a> came back: DS would likely have a 50% chance of an anaphylactic reaction to milk, and a 90% chance of peanuts. So nope, not qualified to take the peanut challenge at this time.</li>


    

<li>He appears to be allergic to other tree nuts, but I’m not sure which one. How do I know? I fed him a mixed nut butter from Trader Joe’s which has the following ingredients: Almonds, Cashew Nuts, Walnuts, Brazil Nuts, Hazelnuts, Pecans, Sea Salt; he didn’t react the first time. The second time? Instant hives, which only went away after two doses of Benadryl. Our next appointment is not until the middle of summer, but at that appointment, we can test for further food allergies like goat’s milk protein, and the nuts, though I suspect it might be walnuts as it seems that it coincides with peanut allergies; he’s had almond milk before without any reaction, as well as almond in Chinese soup.</li>


    

<li>And as mom and son are refraining from nuts and dairy, I have noticed that Bean has asked for dairy items less – she wants his soy milk, and doesn’t ask for cheese, milk, or yogurt nearly as often as before</li>


    

<li>And as a mom refraining from nuts and dairy, I have failed him at least once – which I feel incredibly bad about.  As my body can’t tell if I’ve ingested dairy or nuts, it’s only when he reacts that I’ve known that I had something I shouldn’t have had – specifically, the time when a friend made a special bowl of pasta for me knowing that I couldn’t have garlic or onions, but she had forgotten I wasn’t able to have cheese. I didn’t want to refuse it, so we decided to scrape off the top of it with the melted cheese and I would eat the rest of it. Bad idea. Within 30 minutes of breastfeeding, he threw up. Lesson learned: learn to get over feeling bad for inconveniencing people</li>


    

<li>Another lesson learned: Be skeptical. When someone tells you that a batch of homemade goodies they received from someone else are said to be safe, but it actually wasn’t, you learn that it’s okay not to trust what people tell you.</li>


    

<li>And, if anyone tells you that there is no such thing as dairy-free chocolate (as I’ve been told), it’s a myth; you can find dark chocolate / cocoa without milk, although many varieties <a href="https://www.fda.gov/ForConsumers/ConsumerUpdates/ucm433555.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">might come with a risk</a>.</li>


</ul><h3>Dairy alternatives</h3>


Unfortunately, I’ve noticed that I tend to crave for more sweets because I can’t readily have them anymore, so in my quest to search for sweets and treats that I can have, I’ve come to realize a few things:


<ul><li>Many products that are nut and dairy-free tend to be vegan and gluten-free. I guess, it’s a better cost-benefit to sell a product that meets multiple-dietary needs than just one or two.</li>


    

<li>Be willing to pay a premium for anything that isn’t mainstream; this is true of organic products, and any specialty products like these</li>


    

<li>While I initially enthusiastically tried some dairy-free alternatives, I now am wary of trying most of them as I’ve only found one or two that didn’t have a strange texture or aftertaste:


<ul><li>The <a href="http://sodeliciousdairyfree.com/products/almond-milk-frozen-desserts/mocha-almond-fudge-bars" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mocha almond fudge</a> “ice-cream” bar by So Delicious is surprisingly good, President’s Choice coconut milk-based “ice cream” in chocolate and mango is good and affordable; I have yet to try coconut; and, Belasoy dark chocolate pudding is tasty too!</li>


    

<li>Soy yogurt, coconut yogurt, almond milk yogurt – strange texture and aftertaste, and unusually sweet if fruit flavoured 🙁</li>


    

<li>Fake cheese, either blocks, shredded, or sliced – they tend to be okay together with something like melted on top of a burger, but terrible on its own or where it’s highlighted, like on nachos; I wouldn’t buy it again</li>


    

<li>I had forgotten that <a href="http://blog.fatfreevegan.com/2011/10/what-the-heck-is-nutritional-yeast.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">nutritional yeast</a> can be an interesting alternative to make popcorn taste cheesy</li>


    

<li>The most surprising finds yet:


<ul><li>while Oreo and Pillsbury croissants <em>are</em> dairy-free,</li>


    

<li>many types of margarine are <strong><em>not</em></strong> dairy-free; the ones that are contain artificial flavours, colour and other strange additives – the <a href="http://www.becel.ca/en/becel/becelproducts/becel-vegan.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">vegan one by Becel</a> is the one I ended up buying and using for baking, but I prefer using coconut oil on my toast now over margarine</li>


</ul></li>


    

<li>My favourite stores? Organic Garage in Thornhill, for their discount breads and discount milk alternatives when they’re close to expiry; and locally, <a href="http://www.cefoodexperience.ca/?page_id=29" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ce Food Experience and Bakery</a> where I encountered the most wonderful nut-free, dairy-free apple pie; her partner has multiple allergies, so they have a selection of safe treats to choose from, and <a href="http://www.sevenshores.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Seven Shores</a> for their vegan menu options (including vegan cheese and ease of subbing avocado for mayo for example) and baked treats (sometimes $1 day-olds).</li>


</ul></li>


</ul><h3>The UX of Labels</h3>


I’m used to reading labels to see if a product has garlic, onion, etc. and how high and the sodium content on the nutritional value chart, but when I’m specifically looking for allergens, it’s so much easier when companies decide to highlight them. Here are a few design choices that I’ve encountered:

<ul><li>Ingredients that are a common allergen in bold or uppercase, whether throughout or at the end of the list of ingredients; e.g. “Allergens: <strong>CONTAINS </strong><strong>WHEAT</strong>“</li>

<ul><li>Graphics and lists that tell you what common allergen they don’t have</li>


    

<li>The best is when none of the concerning allergens are listed in the ingredients, and there is a label that enforces that they’re a facility that doesn’t even process a common allergen; e.g. “made in a nut-free facility”</li>


</ul><h4>And then, there’s the possibility that the product <em>might</em> contain a common allergen</h4>

I have a love-hate relationship with the disclaimer on a product that tells me that it <em>may</em> contain an ingredient that isn’t listed, or that it’s processed in a facility or shared-equipment that uses those ingredients. This information is not regulated, and instead seems to be <a href="http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/fn-an/label-etiquet/allergen/precaution_label-etiquette-eng.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">volunteered information</a> – aimed to help consumers (but allows companies to cover their butts I’d say); it’s definitely important to know that a certain product may have been in contact with an allergen, but this information becomes useless in situations where the label isn’t helpful anymore.
It does help when the labels tell me to consult the website for more information, or straight up <a href="http://sodeliciousdairyfree.com/allergen-information" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tells me what they do</a> on the label to make sure that there isn’t any cross contamination. If it’s made in-store, I often find that if I talk to the department in-person or call them, I can decide if I’m comfortable with their methods of cleaning, etc. I have come to trust[ref]perhaps foolishly especially knowing that this label is volunteered info[/ref] that if a certain brand of food always uses the “may contain” label, if this is absent in a product, I take to mean that there are no known possible contaminants.
But, two labels come to mind that have thrown me in for a loop:


<ul><li>This box of cookies that have a giant list of allergens that they’re free from, yet down below in smaller print, it says: “Made in a facility that uses dairy” so now, a little doubt creeps in over the credibility of the “dairy-free” claim.</li>


    

<li>Costco’s rotisserie chicken’s label tells me that it may contain ALL of the top allergens it seems: wheat, fish, milk, eggs, soy, shellfish, crustaceans, tree nuts, sesame, mustard. REALLY? So, I called our local Costco, and spoke to someone from the meat department who prepares these chickens, and he told me that they prepare the chicken in the raw meat room, so the only risk would be fish (shellfish, crustaceans, etc.). <em>Thank you</em>. I guess you can say everything that isn’t packaged in the store might be cross contaminated if they prepare food in an open bakery, but I don’t see bags of apples with those labels…</li>


</ul>
