					<description><![CDATA[It was probably a good move that my parents didn&#039;t buy too many books; I don&#039;t think there would have been enough shelves to support our reading habits. Instead, our bookcases were graced with encyclopedias (including a children&#039;s set) and books bought with our birthday money, and we were allowed to frequent the public library and sign out as many our cards let us have at one time!]]></description>

Good move with substituting higher quality alternatives!]]></description>
