		<p>				The Power of a Praying Parent by Stormie Omartian (I keep thinking it’s “O’Martian”), and we just covered a chapter that talks about releasing our children to God, and this is an example of a very much an appropriate moment to follow her model of prayer: that if it’s in His will and in His time, that our son will outgrow both his allergies; but if not, will be managed well so that no one would ever need to use an epipen on him; but if so, that it is administered successfully and effectively.
I’m still processing the news, so I didn’t get a chance to think of and ask the many follow-up questions that have since popped up (stemming from online research and what others have shared with me – yep, I’m also one of those internet moms), but here are some questions that people have asked and the answers I have come across:
<strong>Q. Will he outgrow his allergy?
A. </strong><a href="http://aacijournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1710-1492-7-S1-S7#Sec12" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Possibly</a>. Our allergist says that many children outgrow their milk allergy by the age of 5. I just found out that my siblings and I all had milk allergies until we were 1 years old, and our mother experimented by trying to reintroduce milk slowly and over time. However, only 20% of kids outgrow their peanut allergy. Because Bean seemed to have a milder reaction to peanut butter when she was younger, but outgrew it by 2 years old – which surprised him, the allergist suggested paying for a blood test to see if her brother would qualify for reintroduction of peanuts under clinical supervision; we’re praying that he’d be eligible. So, as of now, it is what it is – will just have to adapt to manage it.
<strong>Q. How severe is his allergy?
A.</strong> At the skin prick test, the one for peanuts was about 5mm, and the one for milk was slightly larger (6mm, maybe?); I think <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15482519" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the size indicates a positive diagnosi</a>s, but I didn’t think to ask. According to one site, “<a href="http://www.kidswithfoodallergies.org/page/food-allergy-test-diagnosis-skin-prick-blood.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">no test […] can determine severity</a>“. Nevertheless, we’ve been advised to keep two epipens with him. While, I don’t know the criteria for what makes an allergy a risk for anaphylaxis, we have seen <a href="http://aacijournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1710-1492-7-S1-S6#Sec4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">symptoms matching the criteria in Table 3, section 2 (GI and skin symptoms)</a> and <a href="http://aacijournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1710-1492-7-S1-S6#Sec3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">in this table</a>.
The allergist prescribed two injectors (<a href="http://www.kidswithfoodallergies.org/page/newly-diagnosed.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">as does this site</a>), but I think most people I know only carry one. Although he does not meet <a href="http://aacijournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1710-1492-10-40" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the minimum recommended weight of 15 KG (33 LBs)</a>, the allergist still recommended that over a self-administered antidote citing that human / user error is very common. He then used an ultrasound machine to measure the thickness of muscle between the skin and the bone, to make sure that our son’s thighs is fat enough – more than 13mm – <a href="http://aacijournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1710-1492-10-40#Sec2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">so that the injection won’t hit bone</a> (and bone marrow, which is equivalent to a IV administration and that’s bad); he was 16mm. Another option is available (TwinJet?) but is supposedly the same dose.
<strong>Q. Is there no other option other than Epipen? What about Benadryl?</strong>
<strong>A. </strong>The allergist and online sources tells me that Benadryl won’t help with breathing, but it may help reduce other symptoms (e.g. puffy eyes, lips).
<strong>Q. What can he drink instead of milk, to get the fat content and other nutrients that is in whole milk?
A. </strong>My dietician and online sources say that breastmilk is best so to keep breastfeeding for as long as possible. As long as we have the go ahead to eat soy, we can also have soy and coconut milk; there’s rice and almond milk as well. I’ve tried hemp milk, and it tastes like grassy straw, which I’m not a fan of at all. Fortified alternatives provide at least 30% calcium and some fat content, but it doesn’t completely replace milk’s benefits; it’s also a shame that many companies use carrageenan (or xanthan gum, but not as bad) to thicken their drink, and add sea salt to flavour it. I have to remember to continue to supplement him with Vitamin D. For good fat, I will likely have to be more creative, using oils like avocado or olive, and serving more salmon (frozen filet steaks of wild Alaskan salmon is readily available from Kirkland / Costco year-round, works out to be 10$/lb which is reasonable)
<strong>Q. What about formula?
A. </strong>Online sources seem to suggest that if a baby has a milk allergy, baby may have a higher likelihood of developing a soy allergy, so switching to a soy based formula may end up increasing the risk.
<strong>Q. Can he have lactose-free, cheese, or yogurt? What about goat’s or sheep’s milk?
A. </strong>Unfortunately, the allergy is to the milk protein, not the lactose. Most people with milk allergy is to cow’s milk protein, but I’m not sure if we have the go-ahead to try other kinds of dairy.
I did mention that I had accidentally fed him vegetables cooked in butter a couple of times and failed to see a reaction, to which he was surprised, so as a result, he told me keep to doing it, but don’t go beyond what I normally would have done. We will likely have to monitor him very, very closely if we do that – not to mention, we’ll have to watch him even more closely when we aren’t the ones providing his meal / food. Though, I wonder if he can tolerate <a href="https://aacijournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1710-1492-8-5#Sec1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">extreme heated milk products</a> – will have to ask.
<strong>Q. Can he have other nuts?</strong>
A. In theory, yes. Peanuts is technically a legume and not a tree nut (e.g walnut, pecan), but we have to be careful of cross contamination because they may be processed in facility that isn’t peanut free.
<strong>Q. What about peanut oil?</strong>
<strong>A.</strong> I’m not sure about this one. Online sources say that pure unrefined peanut oil should be safe, but I need to check with the allergist about this one. Will likely have to avoid though, especially in commercial places, like restaurants – because can you be sure that it’s pure and unrefined?
<strong>Q. So, are you a peanut and dairy-free household now?</strong>
<strong>A.</strong> Thankfully, complete elimination measures aren’t necessary at this time. In fact, the allergist told us specifically not to stop giving our daughter peanut butter! However, <a href="http://www.hamiltonhealthsciences.ca/documents/Patient%20Education/CowMilkProteinAllergyWhatToEatBreastfeeding-trh.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mom will also need to follow a similar elimination diet</a>, which will be a challenge, as she can’t eat anything from the allium family either (e.g garlic, onions, chives, leeks).
<strong>Q.</strong> <strong>What can I do to help?</strong>
<strong>A.</strong> Pray for us – I (we) have no idea what I’m (we’re) doing. Trying to avoid garlic, onions, etc. is already hard; I’m also thinking that avoiding dairy will likely be more challenging than peanuts. And, if you eat with us, we especially appreciate that you take our dietary needs into consideration – understandably, it’s probably especially hard if you don’t need to conscientious of it in your everyday life; I’m sorry for the inconvenience. If you’re in a similar family situation, I’m open to hearing advice and your experiences too. Thank you!]]>		</p>

					<p>After hearing many personal accounts of living with a severe allergy (and not having access to healthcare that can provide a proper diagnosis!), you have my sympathy! BUT we can be thankful that Levi’s diagnosis came early in life and that now you can work as a family to keep him safe. And be thankful that awareness and our understanding of food allergies continues to grow. It is a life changing situation for sure, so I will be praying for all of you.</p>
