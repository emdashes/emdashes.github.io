					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m not really sure, I think it&#039;s one of three things:
The water is acidic enough to reverse the alkali in the soap, and we&#039;re getting globs of fat back out.  I doubt this, because the precipitate sinks to the bottom and none of it seems to float to the top.
Something in the hard water is reacting with the sodium stearate in the soap and precipitating out calcium stearate.  This is pretty common and is part of the reason you get &quot;soap scum&quot;.
Somehow the essential oils are reacting when you add water.  I&#039;m not sure about this.  I have some pure unscented castile soap at home that I&#039;ll experiment with.  I also happen to have some distilled water.  I&#039;ll update when I find out.

					<description><![CDATA[Oh, yours has floaties too?! (so I&#039;m not alone!)
I had asked a friend if hers ever did, but she only mentioned that it would cloud over when it got colder. I have wondered if the floaties are a result of a preservative-free soap-water mixture. Not all of my bottles had / have them, so I&#039;ve wondered if the type of water (distilled vs filtered - we use the latter, not distilled) affects it, and if adding Vitamin E oil to extend the shelf life would help. I&#039;ve also made less in a bottle, which seems to keep the floaties to a minimum. Have you tried changing bottles or experimenting with any of that?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve actually been using the same method foaming pump with Dr. Bronners for the past few years.  I&#039;ve realized I prefer much more soap... Maybe 40/60 soap water.  Also I find the precipitate rather unappealing.  Do any of the Castile soaps not precipitate when mixed with water?
