					<description><![CDATA[My experience with this restaurant was rather poor. The rice and veggies were frozen ... with freezer burns. Service was poor. Pickup your food if you want to eat in. Hosts weren&#039;t friendly. The only good thing I can say about this place is that prices are cheap and the food would be excellent if it was made fresh. Still beats iron sushi or whatever on campus.]]></description>
