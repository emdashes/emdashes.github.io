					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve sometimes worried that people would put too much trust in a name-search in Google.
When I Google my name, which isn&#039;t that common a name, it would appear that I am originally from Florida, have lived in Edmonton and the mid-west, own an IROC (which I appear to be fanatical about), and am an atheist and youth pastor.  I find the last combination entertaining.  Only one of those things is actually true.
Do any of you end up with really weird backgrounds if you add all the hits for your name together?

					<description><![CDATA[What&#039;s really freaky is that I have generally avoided putting my real name on my blog, yet when I google my name, my blog pops up as the 2nd link.
I have no idea who Google knows my blog belongs to me... there must be a number of people linking my name to my blog!]]></description>
