					<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s common for many ppl to be anxious in front of a crowd or giving a speech in front of a big crowd.  I think it&#039;s our own insecurities about ourselves that causes this with the many reason you pulled up in your post.  I am quite familiar with this as I have experience it quite a bit during my high school days.  I remember going to church and after the service people would interact during the refreshment time and there would be drinks and cake.  I would always just get my drinks and stay near the food section so I don&#039;t have to talk to anybody. Of course there was the usual friends that would come around and there would be some conversation. I think this is just human nature.  I find the more I talk to people (more I expose myself to the fear) the less fearful it becomes. ]]></description>
