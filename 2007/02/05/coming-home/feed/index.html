					<description><![CDATA[missing ya! come back soon! :P
Hmm..must be hard. I can&#039;t imagine if I had to do that. I think one possible fact that your life in loo feels temporary is because thats where you went to school and many of your friends that graduated around the same time as you have left, leaving you feeling a little empty or lonely? Maybe an opportunity to move away from the school area will help you feel like you want to get involved with a new community.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I can completely relate to feeling like a stranger amongst familiar faces.  That was something I feared when moving back to Canada, being left behind and forgotten if you will.  I think it&#039;s inevitable that we feel that way and I do feel disappointed that I&#039;m not as close to some friends like I use to before I left.  It doesn&#039;t mean we&#039;re not friends, just a different type.  ]]></description>
