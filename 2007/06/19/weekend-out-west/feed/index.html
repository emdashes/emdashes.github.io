					<description><![CDATA[The prices are the about same departing from Waterloo (YKF) than departing from Toronto (YYZ) (the airport fees/landing fees are about $10 cheaper from YKF). Take my flight from YKF in June for example: it&#039;s $406.34 on WestJet round trip via YVR (Vancouver) vs. $390.44 via Abbotsford.  From Toronto was the same price. Sometimes it might be cheaper to/from a bigger airport if they have seat sales because they offer more flights.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi there:
Dave From WestJet here - I&#039;m both a WestJet employee and an owner.  Thanks for flying WestJet, and I&#039;m glad to hear that you had a good experience.  It sounds like you&#039;re quite a &quot;sophisticated traveller&quot; (that is to say, you make good use of the web tools out there).  www.SeatGuru.com is a great resource for helping you to predict your seating preference.  Also - in case you didn&#039;t know - you can check-in with WestJet up to 24 hours in advance of your flight nad select your seat.  You can do this on the web at www.WestJet.com or from a mobile phone at mobile.westjet.com.
One more thing ... I&#039;m assuming that you are from the Kitchener-Waterloo area.  I hope you enjoyed flying from the K-W airport (rather than &quot;enjoying&quot; the drive to T.O., parking at Pearson, etc.).  I know that I&#039;ve heard that a lot from people from the K-W area as I&#039;ve been reading blogs lately.
Thanks for flying WestJet!
Dave]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Nice to hear from you Dave from WestJet...adding to that, because I wanted a choice of good seats, I tried to check in at the 24 hours mark, but it said that I was too early! So, I waited a few hours and checked in on mobile.westjet.com with my BlackBerry Curve :)]]></description>
