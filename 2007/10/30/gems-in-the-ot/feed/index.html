					<description><![CDATA[I think history is filled with stories (that may or may not repeat itself). One could look at those stories as a part of an unified, linear storyline - and likewise with the Bible.
Afterall, what defines a story?
One definition from the web (ninjawords.com) is (n) an account of real or fictional events.
Seemingly accurate to me.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[For the longest part of reading your post, I kept thinking I read &quot;Germs in the OT&quot;... and kept wondering how that related to common stories in different books of the bible... :P oops.
btw, next time you&#039;re visiting, remind me to show you the chronological bible that a friend recommended to me. Although it is set to be one of those daily devotionals, I find it quite neat - it tries to put things in somewhat chronological order, but always puts the references in the sidebar so you know what book you&#039;re reading from. When I read from that bible version, I find that I just keep reading and forget that I have actually read a few chapters or even a whole book in one sitting!]]></description>
