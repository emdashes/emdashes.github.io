<p align="right">How to cheat on an exam |10.28.2001|</p>




<blockquote>Disclaimer: I do not necessarily endorse this, but hey, when you’re bored, you find out a lot of things about erasers.
Multiple choice scantron exams work the best for the method that I am about to describe.
Materials need:


<ul><li>1 Smart Friend</li>


    

<li>1 Pentel Soft Eraser</li>


    

<li>1 Pencil</li>


</ul>


The Copied:


<ol><li>Write your answer (A, B, C, D, E if MC) on a white portion of your paper mirrored (ie backwards).</li>


    

<li>Use the flat area of your eraser: press on the answer and hold (“stamp” it like you would with silly putty).</li>


    

<li>Give your eraser to the Copier.</li>


</ol></blockquote>




<blockquote>The Copier:</blockquote>




<blockquote>


<ol><li>Ask to borrow an eraser from the person beside you (who is conveniently your Smart Friend).</li>


    

<li>Read off his or her answer on the eraser and happily apply it to your scantron (if MC) sheet. Trade his answer for one of yours.</li>


</ol>


Repeat.Aside: I have been promoted to a higher class of living, much more “sophisticated” than raccoon meat; I have bought myself “Pogo Sticks”. Yum?</blockquote>

<p align="right">Ramblings |10.23.2001|</p>




<blockquote>“I want you to be merciful; I don’t want your sacrifices. I want you to know God; that’s more important than burnt offerings.” Hosea 6:6 (NLT)What a relief! I think my spiritual walk w God has finally begun to pick up again. Phew. I hope it will only get better from here! It’s been a while since I’ve touched the minor prophets in the OT, but after reading Daniel (and being reminded of our many days we have left here on earth), I decided to read Hosea again (with an odd feeling that this life lesson reminded me of <i>Pretty Woman</i> in a way). That verse just stood out to me somehow; it was almost as if God was telling me, through the words of Hosea, that our inner heart, which is reflective of our actions, is worth sooo much more to God than going through our lives with the “right” motions. The verse sums it up very nicely. Forget the talk, forget the offering, leave it at the altar, and do what you say you would. More importantly, a reminder for me: “Get to “know” Me instead of saying you want to “know” Me; alas, you can’t know Me better through outward acts of service, be it through ministry or on your own.
Recently, I stumbled across the <i>Adventures in Odyssey</i> series again, my childhood radio drama stories that are aimed for 7 to 12 year olds. I guess I’m still 12 at heart, because I still thoroughly enjoy listening to what goes on in the lives of the fictional characters I grew up with. I definitely recommend it to you! They’re worth listening to, especially these two episodes, entitled, <a href="http://www.lifeaudio.com/ministries/lightsource/main/talkInfo.jhtml?id=6963" target="_new" rel="noopener noreferrer"> The Triangle, Part 1</a>, and <a href="http://www.lifeaudio.com/ministries/lightsource/main/talkInfo.jhtml?id=6964" target="_new" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Triangle, Part 2</a>. After I spent about 1 hr listening to the complete episode, I immediately thought of Sponge’s blog, where he was about to rant about breakups and related relationships in suggesting that the “Golden Rule” was something that was not said but acknowledged and to be obliged by with every person. I’m guessing that this “Golden Rule” is what was broken between Jack and Whit.
I can somewhat identify with a couple of the characters in the story because I see situations like this happen in real life. A couple of my friends could potentially fall into the same fate as Whit and Jack Allen in the story, and have been similar situations. And if I was to project myself in the shoes of Jenny, I’d be trapped in a struggle of tug-a-war (and I do somewhat identify with her). The irony of the story is that not all situations in reality end as “pleasant” or half as “ideal” as this one. I picture one of my other friends as Emily; she’s interested in someone that could be represented by Jack, but Jack’s with a girl he loves, and yet he goes to her with his relationship problems. Back to my friend, if the guy wasn’t a non-Christian, I do think that she’d readily go for him (not that she won’t if he wasn’t one, just not as readily) too if he was ever “free” again (and sometimes, I have a nagging suspicion that he is interested in her also but alas, he has a girlfriend). What a complicated life we lead.
How many people do I meet in Ottawa that knows someone I know, or that I know directly in this case?! Tis the strangest phenomena (sp?). Anyhow, I was looking up a Frank Yong (in UW Engineering) one day on the Elijah list because I have no idea who he is, and was curious where he was from, and a name on the directory caught my eye (Ben C is jealous now b/c he didn’t get a directory): Jason Au.
Now, I know there are a TON of Jason Au’s in the world, but I was curious enough anyhow. You see, I knew a Jason Au from my home city/church and he’s 3 years younger than me, so I didn’t know his whereabouts. I decided to look up the name “jason au” on the ICQ search, and it returned 37 results! I was about to give up but only 2 were online, so I checked their info, and one of them had a birthdate that matched the entry in the Elijah directory, so I knew I had a match. What made me more certain was the fact that even though he was in Ottawa, the timezone that he set on his ICQ info was 3 hours behind (matches PST!) and the fact that when I went to cross reference his birthdate with the Jason in my high school youth group’s directory, I was 99 % certain that it was the same guy. So I decided to message him. Turns out, he’s at Carleton for Architecture. Hope he’ll feel welcome at OCAC, once he goes back again! He’s already complaining how there’s nothing to do in Ottawa 😛</blockquote>

<p align="right">Dreams |10.22.001|</p>




<blockquote>I woke up on Saturday morning to a phone call (that I did not answer), and fell back asleep to dream yet again. This time, my sister (or some Chinese girl that I can’t pinpoint) and I exited a building before a portion of it blew up. At that point, I had a distinct impression that part of my elementary school exploded. Someone lady in charge proceeded to guide us away from the building, and pointed us toward the school bus that we were supposed to board. Upon boarding, we were all given a sweatshirt (to keep warm? to change into? I’m not quite sure). As we rolled along for what seem like a long time, I suddenly wondered where we were going and why the bus driver did not tell us of the destination. Coincidentally, there was a schedule of who booked the bus and for what occasion on the window of my seat. I tried to read it, but because it was posted toward the exterior of the bus, the typeset was mirrored. Luckily, the girl in the opposite seat behind me carried a compact with her and kindly lent it to me to decipher all the words. The strange part was that for the week, no company booked it and that cause me bewilderment. I suddenly had this thought, “What if they had in mind to take us someplace of no return?” In my mind, I was praying that God would show us what to do and how to escape. It must’ve been God’s plan, because I arranged to ask the driver to let us off at the next stop for a pee break.The bus stopped at the mall. I proceeded to tell my sister to gather up her belongs and follow me. The had a mall that was 10 stories in height and the main public washroom was on the 3rd floor. As people went to the third floor, we proceeded to adventure higher and further away from the bus as to avoid getting on the bus again. We reached the 7th floor and managed to find a clean, private bathroom before locking ourselves in and looking down to see the bus still parked. A realisation hit me then. Why did they give us the sweatshirts for? Another thought occurred to me. What if they wanted us to wear them beacuse they contained a homing device?! Uh-oh. We panicked. We weren’t proven wrong when the guy from the bus tried to open the door to the bathroom (and I proceeded to scream) so he quickly closed it and waited for us to finish whatever we were doing and waited outside the door for us. We waited forever behind the closed door for him to go away, but we realised that he wasn’t until we came out. So, we came out and acted all surprised to see him there waiting for us (“how did you find us?”) and allowed him to escort us back to the bus so we could all begin the journey to the unknown once again.
At that point, I realised that my theory wasn’t full of holes. I eagerly hoped, anticipated, and waited for the next stop because I figured that there would be more people wanting to use the lavatories as well. Surprisingly, we stopped at another mall. This one had a theatre in the middle of it. My sister and I gathered up what we had, and exited the bus, praying that it would be the last time. We went into the main bathroom, changing out of our sweatshirts and placing it inside the stalls, so that whomever was tracking us would think we were still in the washroom. We cut through the theatre and wandered to another bathroom. After what seemed like a prolonged period of time to make sure that no one would be coming after us, we bumped into the bus guy (or maybe it was another guy), but this time, he told us that the woman let him go (i.e let him free) before starting the bus again so we didn’t have to worry. I had a nagging suspicion that some kids in the mall might have taken those 2 sweatshirts and proceeded to venture off with them before the bus lady appointed another escort to guide them “back” into the bus. Even though I felt bad, at least we were free. So, we decided to watch a movie. Upon entering the movie, for some reason, I introduced the guy to the theatre staff. He said beneath his breath, “That’s funny, I know him by another name.” Uh-oh. Not another trick? But, before I found out, I awoke.</blockquote>

<p align="right">The good, the bad, the ugly. |10.18.001|</p>




<blockquote>The more I’ve talked to people, the more conclusive it seems: for every “outside” student that has worked in Ottawa, one has either had a good experience or a bad one, and neither one in-between. Ottawa either makes you, or breaks you.I’m not entirely sure why Ottawa is special or unique in that way; it has an alluring spell that is cast upon unsuspecting victims. Perhaps it’s the place, or even more so, the people. Placing the blame on a particular person, a group of individuals, an institution, or a particular church would hardly be fair, although sometimes I too wonder.
The irony of it all, is that I’m not sure where I would be classified as a part of the statistics of an “Ottawa experience”. Spending 4 months in a city that is so different than and far away from home and school has its effects. What spell held me bound? What made me vulnerable to its pokes? At the end of it, where did “I” go? I look in the mirror, and all I see is a reflection of my past. Who have I become?
I like what I see, and yet I don’t. Some fire in me has dimmed to a mere glow and is replaced with remnants of bitterness, cyncism, and complacency; an desensitized unfeeling. Yet, almost oxymoronically, the unfeeling sparked feeling. The “me” that never is homesick, somehow felt the feeling of nostalgia once I left the mysterious place. From a distance, faces seem familiar, here on campus. For brief seconds my eyes are fooled into thinking, “Oh look, there’s Hilman!” or “Hey, is that Nate?”, and even, “What is Matt doing here?”. I’ve also gotten to know some others better, even after my departure.
I realise that some here have criticised my choice of friends, deemed me obseessed with my friends in Ottawa. Maybe I am, but how many people will patiently sit with you for 2.5 hours or more every night listening to you rant about things that are utterly pointless? How many will keep you company because you are in dire need of someone to talk to, especially when they have better things to do (like focus on education or work)? And I thank God. Although this has been in sense, the worst summer of my life, due to some unforseen circumstances, it has turned out to be the best in another light. I should thank the catalyst of this, but I better not take this too far . . .</blockquote>

<p align="right">Love has no boundaries |10.14.001|</p>




<blockquote>Oh, Happy Birthday Mom! Today is my mommy’s birthday. My sister and I got her a “mother” picture frame with her picture inside (‘cept I have no idea what it looks like and I won’t be able to pay my sister back for at least 1/2 year or more).I was looking at Dom’s and suddenly wondered if my old webpage would be as cheesy as Denis’ and Marc’s old website (Marc’s is slighty modified now and nothing is working so it’s useless to post his link), but I couldn’t remember where I stuck mine. Suddenly it occured to me to look under the alias of my geocities.com e-mail address, and yipes, my page looks pretty bad. 😛
Today’s sermon was interesting, a continuation on the topic of friendship. One thing that Pastor Tim said really hit me: You cannnot choose to have friends. I was like “HUH?!”. But the statement after made sense: You can choose to be a friend, but you cannot choose to have a friend. That’s quite true. No matter how hard I try, there are bound to be people that want to be my best friend. One analogy with my cousin can be applied here: my 3.5 year old cousin likes me soooo much that I’m priviledged to be able to sit beside for dinner (over his parents even), to play with him when he’s bored, and to help him change clothes, even if I don’t have the patience to make him content. I don’t choose to be his “favourite cousin”, I just am, and for no apparent reason (since I only see him about once a year). Maybe that’s the way it is in life. . .</blockquote>

<p align="right">Procrastination |10.13.001|</p>




<blockquote>This entry should be entitled Miscellaneous II but ah well. I’m taking yet another break from my school work. I can’t believe that for 6 hours, I’ve been doing the following:


<ul><li>coding: yaay! finally done; my robots can now build a house!</li>


    

<li>cleaning the house: mopping and sweeping (to be explained why later)</li>


    

<li>procrastinating: reflecting and surfing the net</li>


    

<li>munching: had lunch late and dinner early . . .or was it a “linner”, if breakfast+lunch=brunch?</li>


    

<li>laundry: finally done.</li>


</ul>


I think there’s something wrong w me. Not sure what it is though (aside from the fact that before summer 2001, I thought that forgiveness came easy for me–well, I was proved wrong by me). Last night, we went to Leung Yue for some siew-ye and watched bits and pieces of  <i>Fulltime Killer</i>, starring Andy Lau and some Jap-named actor who knows Chinese?. (Aside: there’s this really cool Flash sniping game on that site). Afterwards, I developed a slight rash on my upperarm (but it mostly receeded this morning), and somewhere on the right part of my neck/jaw started to be very sore. J thinks that it might be my lymph nodes. Great. I have no idea what that means.
Laundry mess. On my way out to do some laundry, the glass jar that held my laundry detergent in it fell outta my bag and smashed into pieces onto the floor. Great. I hope none of you ever haveta sweep/mop up glass and liquid laundry detergent (enough for 2 loads) at the same time. Let me tell you, it’s one of the more challenging messes to clean. The more you mop, the more soapy it gets, no matter how many times you rinse the mop. So, I decided to sweep and mop the rest of the house since I was cleaning anyhow. To top it all off, when I took everything to the laundry room (which is in another building), all the machines were taken! Thankfully, when I abandoned it there, nothing was stolen (or to my knowledge), unlike Ben C’s misfortune when a poor lad (being optimistic here!) stole his pants and white socks.
Hmm, I wonder if one puts enough gelatin into jello, would one be able to make gummibears? :)…</blockquote>

<p align="right">Miscellaneous |10.11.001|</p>




<blockquote>Wow, I just renewed my domain name <i>sheepie.net</i> for a LOT ($24.95 USD/year, which really works out only to approx $12.48 USD/year since I had my first year free :P). Well, not really if I was living in the States, but unlike an accountant would, I neglected to calculate the exchange rate. I should’ve paid for it on a day where the CDN $ was high. 😛 Ah well. But good news to those of you who can’t remember my superlong URL, it’s <i>sheepie.net</i> for yet another year. Phew.
You can also access:


<ul><li><i>photos.sheepie.net</i> for my photos</li>


    

<li><i>elijah.sheepie.net</i> to be redirected to the elijah fellowship homepage (which is momentarily under construction). . . and of course,</li>


    

<li><i>impromptu.sheepie.net</i>, where you are now</li>


</ul>


In my procrastination at work today, I decided to invest ICQ SMS. Guess what? I actually have every one of your SMS replies (sent from ICQ, replied via phone) stored in my SMS web-box. If you ever had difficulties receiving ICQ SMS replies from a phone, you might want to consider checking out the <a href="http://mobile.icq.com/60978221" target="_new" rel="noopener noreferrer">ICQ SMS Web-Box</a>, where <i>60978221</i> is replaced with your ICQ number.
Cell group was good yesterday. New friends came and we sang songs in Chinese that I actually knew (thanks to last year’s cell group ;P). During our prayer/sharing time, one of the fellow brothers brought out a very good point about the events following the WTC, etc. attacks. It’s ironic how everyone is sympathetic about lives lost in America but we (as reflected in media) tend to celebrate , cheer, and encourage even more innocent lives to be lost in retaliation. The loss on September 11, 2001, hit so close to home and brought people together, but can’t we also feel compassion towards those that live in other parts of the world? Does the distance make everything okay? How are we, in any way, “better” than “they” are for our acts?
Oh yeah, as I predicted earlier, I received my driver’s license back via snail mail on Friday, before the Thanksgiving weekend. Even though I didn’t get it in time for the weekend, at least now I feel more secure with it 😛</blockquote>

<p align="right">I’m Thankful For … |10.08.2001|</p>




<blockquote>…Thanksgiving. Without the annual weekend, I would not have been able to take a break from all that Java and actually enjoy myself in Toronto (almost a first). Think this weekend actually felt like I was back in Ottawa once again (the coldness sure reminded me of it)….my friends. Without them, I would not have enjoyed my Thanksgiving weekend, even though I didn’t eat a traditional thanksgiving dinner. Ah well, Congee Wong sure makes a good substitute :). ‘Cept the MSG is overdone b/c I was overthirsty and contracted a sore throat as a result.
Friday: I met up with Goldfish Man, Frank, Marcroni, Dim Sum (seems like I’ve known him forever), and Jonny Boy in the evening for some 10-pin bowling. I dunno how Summy does it, because he got strikes even with his left hand! Thankfully, I did not place last in either of the 2 games. I think my 4 days spent bowling in HK really helped. Phew. :). Bubble tea afterwards at Eternity took an eternity. I know why it’s called that now–b/c the service is sooo slow.
Saturday: I can’t remember what we did, thus X> (J) thinks that I got myself drunk somewhere along the lines during this weekend. Oh! Yeah, we went to Pac Mall (my second time) to eat some yummie sushi (pricey but good). Jon drove me to Office Place to get some of my course material photocopied. On Chapters: if any of you ever are in a strange need to get on the ‘net for 15 mins at the Kennedy Commons Chapters, the $2/20 mins is unrefundable, so you can use my username and password: aimeili + lollipop. I’m glad that we stopped at Chapters b/c I was able to get 4 of my textbooks (that I was fortunately still missing) for the price of 3, and one of them was cheaper than the suggested retail price. So, being Chinese, I saved myself $20.
Dinner was yummy. McFish burger. Just kidding. Well, we did have a McD’s meal for an appetizer before joining Silq, Danny, Hoi, Lawrence, Shaw for some all-you-can-eat Korean BBQ. Tastes better than what we do at home–less messy too! Spent some QT with Silq, Mumbles, and Jonny Boy, at the local Timmy Ho’s–‘cept that particular one had people who didn’t understand English or something b/c even after I told her what I wanted twice, she came up with COLD ICE CAP (vs. hot cap).
Sunday: Church at T3C was alright. I have a particular preference for OCAC though if I was to choose from those 2 (b/c their styles of worship are somewhat similar). They actually had only 2 songs I knew (and from OCAC’s POV, only 1 song). Most of them were older songs, and the only new one was, “Love You So Much” (Hillsongs). I caught up w a couple of ppl I haven’t seen around much in the ‘loo, and we went to lunch at some Malay/Singaporean food court type place. Food was quite yummie. Photocopied the rest of my course material at Business Depot/Staples and shopped again at Pac Mall (don’t we just love it there? :P).
Dinner at Congee Wong (which we spent for lunch the following day as well before we all parted our separate ways). And night of fun and games at Dave and Busters. Ha. I was <i>sooo</i> close in having to not be able to get in b/c my parents neglected to send me my drivers licence in time and I had no proof of ID (since I look about 17). As a TO “bouncer” he was quite nice about accepting my student ID as some form of photo ID (though not age). The rest of the guys though, even though they had ID and had been of age for awhile now (yes, even Marc), he said to me, “I’ll let you in this time, but even these guys are only on the cusp”. Right. But I wasn’t complaing b/c I got let in :).
Spent most of my $20 on racing/arcade games. Surprisingly, I beat most of them (‘cept Jon) at Daytona and Daytona 2 on an automatic (they varied from standard/manual to automatic). Actually, I give them credit b/c it takes skill just to shift properly, whereas all I do, is step on the accelerator, and ease on them during the turns and accelerate again (brakes are used only in emergency situations). Not hard. Yaay. =). That was fun. The next part was concentrating on ticket/token games. The combination of Jon, Marc, Derrick and my efforts at various games (I flukedly managed to get 100 tix in a game) got me a package of gummy bears to share w them (eating and mutilating :P) during our coffee at Timmy’s :). Yummy. Think the sugar kept me going during the night.
Conclusion: Weekend was well spent. Wish I knew these guys earlier in my university career!

<p align="right">Indian Summer? |10.03.2001|</p>




<blockquote>I wonder what constitutes as an Indian summer? Days where sunshine warms the hearts of people, where one can blade outside in Ts and shorts? Days, at 26C, when Ben C decides to ask me to go to the driving range and I <i>actually</i> want to go, yet I have to go to class? Days, where my prof complains that it’s too warm for an autumn afternoon?So, in the midst of the lovely day, Ben and I decide to check out the job fair at the campus’ “party hall”: Fed Hall. Now, I can actually graduate and say that I have seen Fed Hall from the inside. I think I shocked Ben C when he learned that I don’t participate in the parties and the dances our campus holds. 😛 Ah well. Ben, surprisingly, likes clubbing. But then again, he likes ballroom, so that’s prolly why. So anyhow, Fed Hall isn’t at all what I imagined it to be; instead of being big, it’s quite small, and instead of having “gym” floors, most of it is carpet. Quite classy if it’s in the right setting.
Yup. Um. That’s all I gotta say today.</blockquote>

<p align="right">4 hours at the local mall! |09.30.2001|</p>


<span style="font-family: Century Gothic,Tahoma;"><span style="font-family: Century Gothic,Tahoma;"><a name="87"></a></span></span>


<blockquote><a name="87"></a> Yipes. 4 hours (1 was spent grocery shopping)! That’s the whole afternoon spent at the mall in Waterloo! But it’s okay, I actually had fun shopping yesterday with Ben C.–he ended up buying over $120 dollars worth of clothes and most of it was spent at Winners–a place he hasn’t been to before, so it was fun taking him in (I’m just glad he bought something even though I didn’t just to show how the place isn’t as worthless as it seems) :P. He also bought a pair of pants at a store that he thought would be “too young” for him. Heehee, he’s funny.<a name="87"></a> I paid a visit to “my” store (I call it my store b/c no one else around me tends to fit into these clothes): Gap Kids. I’m not sure if the size 14+ khaki pants (style Gap Classic) was worth my $22.99 (because I just bought pants that are less in HK (it was $8), and a couple years ago, Gap Kids had pants for $18.99), but I had to account for inflation and tax-free clothes :). Size 14+. I cannot believe that I size 14+ waist is still waay too loose for me (think if I gained 5-10 lbs, it’d still fit me). If I didn’t have a belt, I think I could use the “elastic” feature of the “adjustable waist” (but I don’t like that, so I don’t think I’ll incorporate it). Hmm. I just thought of something. I think the “+” indicates it as pants for bigger kids. That would make sense. Ah well. I like the style and no hemming is needed, but if I really get hung up on the waist size of the pants, I still have 14 days to return it :).
I also didn’t accomplish my goal in getting some fall or winter wear, but instead, got a navy polo T (“cute”, according to Ben) that was on sale for $6.99 at the same place. Blue. Great, another “blue” shirt to add to my existing “blue” collection. Ah well, it was a good deal (even though I got blue T’s in HK for $2, but nothing here can compare to over there). Heheh. 🙂
Today’s SS was good .We spent the time at the playground–not playing, but just sitting outside and enjoying the warmth of the sun (possibly for the very last time), was very good cept for the number of wasps that were swarming around certain individuals.
Anyhow, naptime. Need more sleep. Think I caught a cold last night. See ya. Hrm. I think I’ve changed my mind. I need to program 😛</blockquote>

<blockquote><a name="86"></a> For the first time in my entire university career, I discovered where Radio Waterloo actually exists on campus. For my four years here, I haven’t found that place, but today, an aspiring accountant drove us to get a $4.10 fee refund (for people like me who don’t like paying any unnecessary fees). ‘Tis a tiny lil building that looks really old and run down and it’s in the middle of nowhere. Literally, the path to the place was not even paved, nor were there signs that told people where they were located. I have no idea how he managed to walk his way to this place in first year, much less even <i>find</i> it!Now, today, I will make a defense for this poor lad. And if any of you don’t like it, then don’t read any further. I know that some of you refer to this particular person as a cheap “illegitimate child” (that is not a direct quote, but it’s close to it), because certain actions makes some wonder (even though I can think along the same pattern as he does). I learned something today: the rest of his class is exactly like him!
Why do I say that? Because at the Radio Waterloo HQ today, the names of those that requested a mere $4.10 refund were all accounting students from his class (‘cept mine). The 4 of us (3 of which were in accounting) even bumped into two others on our way out. Accounting students must be really articulate in getting the most for the least. Most people don’t even bother to wander there because of the distance. And for my 3 years in UW, I didn’t even know where it existed!
In conclusion (even though English professors tell us <b>never</b> to sum up something with “in conclusion”): face it, he’s going to be an accountant. Probably a good one at claiming tax credits/returns too! 🙂</blockquote>

<span style="font-family: Century Gothic,Tahoma;"><span style="font-family: Century Gothic,Tahoma;"><a name="85"></a></span></span>


<blockquote>Eew! I think there’s something seriously wrong with the sewage system in Waterloo today. I think it must be the heavy rains and thunderstorms that took place on Friday night. Today, as my housemate and I were doing our cleaning duties, some alarm suddenly went off. We went about our business and later our DMs told us to stop using the water b/c the alarm was a sewage alarm and the North building was flooding from some system failure. Yuck.To top it off, Ben Cheung’s place had a toilet problem. It threw up at Wilson. Poor fellow. And the maintenance office is not opened til tomorrow. ‘Tis a good thing that they have another bathroom in the house. Ben A came home and reported that William’s was closed due to some circumstance–won’t be surprising if it has something to do w the sewage system. 😛
Aside: I’m with Rogers again! The luxury of being able to stay at home and doing my CS lab (and procrastinate alongside) w/o having to go to the slow computers at school . . .</blockquote>

<blockquote><a name="84"></a> Or should I say a lack of service? The KW white/yellow pages do not even have a number listed for them, and the school rep hasn’t even returned my call yet (even after the flyer quotes that all calls will be returned w/in 24 hrs). When I did finally find a brochure that listed their number, customer service asked me what ROOM I stayed in (a vs. b). The last time I checked, our apartment does not have room numbers and we get bills going to the SAME mailbox. They refused me an account because I didn’t know where I lived. How silly is that?! If my previous sublettor had not disconnected my phone (and taken the number w them), I would have just taken Sympatico up on their $20/mnth DSL offer. Why bother waiting for good service from Rogers when even at the start they can’t really <i>seem</i> like they’re good?<a name="84"></a> Here’s my journal from my trip btw: asia.html (also linked in my travels section).

<span style="font-family: Century Gothic,Tahoma;"><span style="font-family: Century Gothic,Tahoma;"><a name="83"></a></span></span>


<blockquote><a name="83"></a> Today is deemed the National Day of Mourning across both Canada and the US, for the lives that were innocently lost in the crises of September 11, 2001. For many, prayers of hope and pleas are uplifted to a God that is finally made real for them in their desperation. In the midst of this, communities are united, bonded together than stronger before. Yet, I am sad to see that there are those who assault those who are of the same ethnicity as the suspected, whether physically or emotionally, on our campuses or in the environment around us. I somehow highly doubt that they have any connection with those who plotted the act and I’m sure that they would not have wanted this to happen as much as the rest of us didn’t.<a name="83"></a> And as much as the president of the US paraphrases Romans 8:38-39 (which says, “For I am convinced that neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons, neither the present nor the future, nor any powers, neither height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord.”) in his <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2001/US/09/14/bush.memorial/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">speech</a>, I am also greatly disturbed at the idea of war. His speech speaks of God’s love and comfort, which in bittersweetness, contrasts against his stand on retaliation and revenge. War just makes everything worse, and more innocent lives will be lost. I’m not excusing the acts of these people, but just take a look at Pearl Harbour and Hiroshima.
Forgiveness, anyone?
May God have mercy on us.</blockquote>

<p align="right">“The sky is falling!” |09.12.2001|</p>


<span style="font-family: Century Gothic,Tahoma;"><span style="font-family: Century Gothic,Tahoma;"><a name="82"></a></span></span>


<blockquote>Henny Penny said to her friend, “The sky is falling, the sky is falling!”. In my last entry, my Monday did not end until that night. As I was calling Bell that day, I knocked over a fragile lamp that did not belong to me (it belonged to one of my sublettors/brothers in CCF). The outer shell shattered and left 2 gaping holes. I was like, “UH OH. Whatever am I gonna do?! I really hope that this isn’t a gift from someone that contains sentimental value because even if I was to pay him back (which looked expensive too), I cannot replace the sentimental associations.” Thankfully, he didn’t want it (I didn’t tell him about the holes though) when he came to give me last month’s cheque.After a day’s crises was over, I was talking to my mother on the phone and all of a sudden realised that my driver’s liscence was missing from my wallet! I said to my mom, “My driver’s liscence is missing.” She said, “Okay.” and continued our conversation. Slowly, I started to drift paying attention to the conversation. Where did I see it last?! And I realised that my mother probably didn’t hear me right and repeated what I just told her. That’s when she started freaking. I was more calm then she was. Thankfully, I remembered that I had left it in the Karaoke place back in BC, and called Zeke up to help me check if it was there. Surprisingly, they still had it, and he picked it up for me. PHEW. Well, I guess I’ll be IDless for a while so no clubs/drinks for me. :P.
And I thought I had a bad start to my week, until yesterday, when our CS TA told us that 4 planes attacked WTC. I was like, yeah right, you’re kidding me. How can 4 (I had imagined fighter jets) planes attack a building w/o the US air security (or whatever it’s called) knowning?! He said that he wasn’t lying, that’s why our Internet connection was so slow. I quickly logged into Twinkle after class and tried to read up on the headlines. All the major newsites were down and it was the truth. Well, not 4 at WTC, but it was pretty much exactly what he said. What a nightmare!
I think because it seems like a scene from a movie or a game (too surreal), I don’t really feel anything. I mean, yeah, I’m not happy that this happened, but it’s not hitting me as hard as it should. I’m just kinda numb or become desensitized or just pure cold. Definitely it’s news, but somehow, I’m neither in tears nor running around like a chicken with its head cut off (like people my friends know). I think there’s something wrong with me because one of the first things I thought of was (because I was looking at a Christian sale flyer), “OH! Like Columbine and Oaklahoma, someone is going to get rich just by writing on this tragedy.” Great. Of all things to do or think about. Somehow though, as I was reflecting last night (on Sunday School and what I taught them last term), I realise that this would be definitely a good time for revival, prayer, and where God can work and opportunities for Christians to answer the question, “If God is such a loving God, then why does He allow pain and suffering in this world?”
I will write again. Something amusing just happened. A student came in to ask information about the language tapes and wondered if I was in second year.
“Nope.”
“Oh, so are you first?”
“Actually, I’m in 4th year.”
Reply: “OH! Did you fast- track or something?!”
Why does everyone automatically assume that I fast-track whenever I tell them I’m in 4th year? 😛</blockquote>

<blockquote>Have you read the children’s book about a no good, very bad day? So far, the start of the school term has not been the best for me. Well, at least I woke up in time, after 4 hrs of sleep or so : ). I woke up this morning with my muscles all stiff and sore (from moving?! I have no idea why). Went to school to try to talk to an advisor about my CS problem. I find out that he really has no sympathy for my situation. He tried to compare my decision to minor in CS like him deciding to fly someplace tomorrow in hopes of finding a plane ticket. Well, yeah, that’s understandable. One thing that did learn is that I should have added an additional note in the section provided when I submitted my request to be placed on the waiting list. Apparently, the list is sorted not by a first come, first served basis, but rather on a priorty service. Ah well.I did not look at my schedule carefully enough and almost walked into a Math class instead of a CS class that I want to sit in for this week (in case I get in next week). Well, I kinda did. I turned the knob and walked in and realised that the prof did not look like the prof that was supposed to be teaching that course. Thankfully, I walked out before I sat down and realised my mistake. Sigh.
I needed to see my potential employer today about the PT Lang Lab job that Bonnie seems to have successfully landed. I went to school to print my resume and cover letter and realised that I forgot my letter at home. So, I went home for lunch and to find my letter. I found it in one of my other disks, so I proceeded to pack it and go to school. I walk to school, bump into Sponge and hit the lab to print. Guess what?! I stuck the wrong disk into my bag! I go back home and try to find the file. I can’t find it! I’m thinking to myself that all along, Sponge is probably right that it’s in my OTHER disk at school. I go back to school and check and it’s not there! Sponge says to not worry about the cover letter and just hand it in, so I proceed to staple the 2 pages of my resume together BUT all my staples in my mini stapler are OUT. SIGH. Thankfully, the MathSoc has a stapler and it’s only 1 floor higher. I bump into Ben C. on the way, and when I walk to the Arts building to hand it in, the guy wasn’t even there!!! I was like, great. Mental note: call him next time before I walk over.
To top off the whole day, I call 310-Bell today to complain that my phone service wasn’t working yet. I beeseech thee, brethen (in view of God’s mercy, to . . . ) call up 519-884-0837 and ask for me. I guarantee that I won’t be there even though I am listed as the co-user. My sublettor decided to take the phone number with him so that I will have to pay a connection fee if I decide to connect my phone again. Thank you, my friend, you are too kind to me. Wait til my housemate finds out about this one!
I wonder what else will hit me next . . .</blockquote>

<blockquote><a name="80"></a> Ahh, the sounds of music. <a href="http://www.lesmis.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Les Misérables</a> was my first musical seen in Vancouver (QE Theatre), but not my first musical seen elsewhere mind you, and my sister impressively landed us 6th row seats to this broadway show. Although this musical was like Miss Saigon (seen in New York), in that it had no dialogue (only expressed in songs), it was much more interesting, and easier to follow the plot. Les Mis in QE lacked a bit in utilising props (they could at least have placed water in the wine jugs so to pour out real liquid) and the stage. Although the main stage piece was mighty impressive (as it changed into different things and used for a variety of purposes for different scenes), Lion King (seen in Toronto) was by far the best in costume and overall performance (in my opinion only).The sermon today was slightly striking. Although it was only a surface review of James 1:1-12 (on trials), it brought a couple of things to mind. One being what occured in the past summer in Ottawa, and whether I’m supposed to view that as a trial; I think I want to just stuff that in the back of my mind and bury it forever b/c the more I think about it, the more bitter I get just thinking about it. And for some reason, it also brought me back to what happened last night. . .
. . .Why can’t people just leave me alone?! I’ve had enough from different people telling me how to live my life, and especially what kind of friends I should have. You (not <i>you</i> directly) don’t think that I <i>want</i> (or have any for that matter) girl-friends?! As I reflect, I look back into my childhood and I ask myself if the reason why I don’t tend to “click” w girls as much, is b/c of the fear of them hurting me (or destroying my self-esteem) as they did when I was younger. I mean, yes, guys hurt girls too, but it’s a different kind–a kind that I can deal with for the time being (but for those that lose my respect, that’s a different story). Or maybe b/c I’m at Waterloo, a school filled with guys in CS/Engineering, etc. . . technical stuff that I’m really into. I’m thankful that my friends, guys OR girls, have stuck by me through these many months/years. So, if you EVER want to see me in a very bad mood, suggest that I find some friends that are girls. I think my parents successfully do that <i>every</i> time I come back (one of the reasons why I don’t like saying who I will be going out with when I ask for permission to go out b/c for the majority of the time, guys are involved). Thank God that ALL my friends from my high school are girls, else I’d get lectured for wanting to go out with them as well. My housemate in Ottawa seemed to have successfully really peeved me as well in that manner–and coincidentally, and back then, another friend gave me the impression that I should find new friends in Ottawa, b/c they were mostly of bad influence. Gee, thanks.
Okay, anyhow, enough of one of my first public rants. I’m going to sleep now. Hopefully, whatever stomach virus that seems to have started AFTER I got back from HK, will have settled by the time I go out to eat tm night w my guy and GIRL friends.</blockquote>

<blockquote>I’m back from a 2 week journey in Asia. I’ll be writing up my journal and posting it online later so you’ll hear all about it when I’m done. 🙂 Just remind me to tell you about my paranoia about the plane crashing . . . if I don’t remember to write it in my journal.I was excited to visit my home fellowship again, after not being around for at least 8 months (or more). The first impression I got when I walked in was, “HUH?! Who <i>are</i> these ppl at my church?!” GQ has grown tons (thanks be to God) since I last chaired it (in 98)–and what’s funnier is that some ppl know me and I don’t even know their names!, and 3D has been growing too (and some regulars have disappeared as an “exchange”?!). As Mur said earlier, she doesn’t even think of me as a church member anymore. I can certainly understand why. Technically (under the church by-laws, which I received in my baptismal class in 96), one isn’t after 3 months of being away. So does that mean I am not a member of any church?! Wow.
Initiation of the highschool grads to 3D (young adults fellowship). One of the “activities” involved us throwing water balloons and flour at them, making them stick their faces in whipped cream (not whipping cream, my mistake :P), and crack an egg on the opponents forehead. Lastly, we made them stuff as many marshmellows in their mouths and say, “I am a Christian” w/o having to spit or chew it down. One of the girls <i>actually</i> won that one against the guys. She had 12 marshmellows in her mouth all at once (big ones too mind you!). Impressive.
Plans for weekend? Not much. Maybe K-OK w some Burnaby North/BAC friends on Monday and rest of the week–un and repacking and finishing up some stuff before school starts again.</blockquote>

I wonder if I’ll have homemade food anytime soon? So far, I went out to eat for dinner w my grandparents, and “yum cha” with them for lunch.I can’t believe that Fido would charge $25 for a new SIM card! As Chinese as I am, I was almost tempted to purchase one of the “free” phones from them, just so I don’t have to pay the 25 dollars! The account activations guy almost convinced me that Fido would also charge me to change phone numbers if I was to move to a different area code. Thankfully, I called Customer Service to ask them today, and they said there was no charge. Don’t you just love the diff depts of customer support?!
Lessee, I saw <i>Someone Like You</i> on the plane. I saw it w Ben A. the first time in Waterloo, and the movie really wasn’t any better the 2nd time around. I finally figured out where I saw Ashley Judd’s friend, she’s one of the ppl that Mel Gibson sleeps w in <i>What Women Want</i>, I think. And Eddie plays Wolverine in <i>X-Men</i>.
Yummy! Marie treated me to a meal of All-You-Can-Eat Japanese meal at Metro today =)! At $10.95 per person, we were so full. Jo was there too, and Mur asked me if I wanted to invite anyone else, and for some odd reason, I didn’t want any guys around this time. It was weird; felt like home again =). I had to adjust to all our usual hyperness, and watching Jo dance at the DDR, just reminded me that I was back in good ol’ couver. And I’m planning to grab a handful of ppl to go karokeing later on as well–might as well take advantage of it before I leave to a place where no one I know goes or the karoke places are lacking.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Hmm, two drinks within 4 days. Wow, never really drank that much (excluding wine) before. Well, for dinner, we went to Milestone’s. I’ve never been to the ones in BC, but the one here in North York was quite good (though a bit on the pricey side–but, thanks Ben for the yummy dinner =]). Ben told me that the Bellini’s were famous there, so I ordered one. It actually tasted better than the Blue Lagoon; this one had white rum, champagne, peach and something else in it.We met up w Gladys and Sponge for lunch @ Taste of Japan. Sponge hasn’t changed much with the way he thinks and w his speech. Ah well. Wonder who would win if J and Sponge had a “Chinese-swearing” contest? Oh yeah, I decided that I would avoid exposing myself to anything American Pieish, so I decided to give the AP2 CD-ROM to Sponge. I think he’d enjoy it more than I would.
Met up with Ben C. and Kevin H. for bubbletea at Ten Ren’s–which actually changed its name to Arrameia or something bizarre. Kiwi bubbletea tasted quite good surprisingly. But I still prefer honey in jasmine tea w tapioca b/c it’s less artificial looking and tasting.
Anyhow, I’m flying soon! Guess, this will be my last entry from Ontario for awhile :).</blockquote>

<blockquote>No, I haven’t been listening to BSB’s CD.
What a weekend! So many interesting things happened, and reality hits: no more MK (open 7 days/wk now!), won’t be seeing these guys for awhile, no more making fun of rice cars, or punching Silq/Marc–just for target practice in case I get mugged in HK or something 😛 (right).My last day in Ottawa will be well remembered, considering that I have a bruise on my face (cheekbone) to carry around. 🙂 Too bad I can’t say that Marc beat me up so I can go after him w J’s 4-step kick-in-the-face technique. Actually, despite the fact that I only managed to obtain 1.5 hours of sleep the night before (b/c I like to pack and clean last minute), I went rollerblading for the last time (in a long while at least). On one of the slopes, I um, held onto Marc’s bag for support, but neglecting the fact that the centre of gravity would shift b/c of an imbalance. He fell, and I hit my face on his head. Ouch. Can’t chew or smile properly :P. He has a hard head. There better be substance inside! Just waiting to see what it will look like tomorrow morning :þ. This time, Yvonne, Andy, and Roger joined us (and Lon sat and waited for us).
Saturday’s fellowship was actually quite good. I’m glad that I managed to make it out to at least 1 Bible Study at Elijah this term. Yesterday’s topic was on authenticity in relationships. Even though the material is from Willowcreek (grr), it was surprisingly good. I could think of 2 situations of the Tunnel of Chaos. One that is probably yet to come, and one that has already gone through it w/o much result (I’m thankful that I’ve met P as my prayer partner though b/c she can relate w me w her situation!). Edward organised a gathering for me afterwards, which was pretty neat b/c we went to the lounge/jazz bar at Chateau Laurier. Marc and Jon recommended me to try a Blue Lagoon as a starter (tropical punch w/ gin). I think I still like wine better 😛 (uh oh, I’ve b//c a Dill!). And yes, I was pretty pink, even after only 1 glass. Ah well.
While we were waiting for Lon, Andy, Yvonne, and the rest of them to show up for a group picture, a few of us decided to check out the 5th floor (as it’s supposed to be “haunted”). The atmosphere looked spooky enough–locked doors, long corridors, angled mirrors, and Marc making ghost noises (although, I’m not sure how he knows what ghosts sound like). We ended up going up a spiral staircase that is supposed to have a dead end, but it turns out that the 7th floor is a doctor’s office or something! Unfortunately, because the other group was still in prayer/discussion by the time we came back, I couldn’t get any pics with them. Sigh. And to think that shortly after I left, they started taking pics w/o me!
Friday. Ah yeah, that’s right. Josh, being the kind soul that he is, decided to help me lighten my load by cleaning one of the bathrooms in my house for me! :). Marc came over later, not to help, but to play N64 for the last time before I returned the games to Danny (Thx Danny, we ALL had a blast w them–they guys especially like WWF No Mercy!). They stayed til 130 AM, but thankfully, I was able to sleep in til 1230 PM the following day.
Thursday: met up w Phuong, May(?), Sehar (all of Marc’s gfs :P) and Silq, Chau, Moeman, and Mumbles at Chu Sing for dinner.
Wednesday? I can’t seem to remember that far. Oh right! I went shopping and bought myself another skirt =). That’s 3 in total in my entire collection. Hehehe.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Heheh, a bunch of us went to see RH2 last night. ‘Twas quite funny. I especially enjoyed it b/c of the Cantonese dialogue that was scattered throughout and Chris Tucker’s attempt at it. There wasn’t too much blood and gore, which I liked b/c martial artsy violence is something totally different all together. I guess the HK scenes were just a preview of what’s to come in HK for me: the crowds, heat, pollution, noise, smells, etc. Joy.I also watched <i>Center Stage</i> again the previous night. The first time was better–it wasn’t as good the second time around. Would you believe that the first time around, I went with 2-3 other guys (and both of them are not girls in the least) and Mur? We ended up sneaking in early to sneak a preview at <i>Gladiator</i> (which I decided that I didn’t want to finish watching and not to mention we were in the front of the theatre) before going into <i>center Stage</i>. Surprisingly, the triathalon athlete enjoyed it (as did I b/c it kinda gave me a glimpse of what my aunt would’ve gone through if her father allowed her to study in England on a ballet scholarship). Silq likes it too :).</blockquote>

<p align="right">One weekend left. |08.06.2001|</p>


<span style="font-family: Century Gothic,Tahoma;"><span style="font-family: Century Gothic,Tahoma;"><a name="74"></a></span></span>


<blockquote><a name="74"></a> Ben C. actually drove up to Ottawa this weekend. I’m glad he had fun too :). On Friday, he was able make it to the BBQ that was held at my place (now I got some major cleaning to do). Oddly enough, I sent a mass e-mail to Elijah and I was only expecting Silq, Mumbling Marc, Mir and Nate to come (and Danny to drop by after worship practice)–but it turned out last minute that Mir wasn’t able to make it, Nathan wasn’t sure, and everyone else showed up that I wasn’t really expecting, but it was all good b/c we had waay enough food. And I got to know Gabby and her friend Jo better. So all in all, Ben C, Gabriella, Joanne, Gravy, Andy, Nate, Silq, Marc, and later Danny showed up. Oh yeah, and Dom popped in earlier before he worked.<a name="74"></a> We started eating around 8ish, and then afterwards, some played N64 while some others played some really cool “English” boardgame, Blurt. Silq didn’t know what most definitions meant :P. As soon as Marc and I “crashed” the game, we discovered a really cool set of <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lego</a>! Apparently, it retails for $129.99 USD. Wow. As soon as we started <i>Lethal Weapon 4</i>, people decided they wanted to leave. Ah well, I finished Uncle Benny’s film the following day and Dom came over w <i>Bedazzled</i>.
Sunday was quite energising to say the least. Since there was no Sunday School, we had lunch at New Mee Fung (Ben C’s idea) and blading in blazing heat for 3 hours. I discovered that my wheels were soo slow compared to everyone else’s (considering they were Jrs.) — that I had to glide continually when Ben (and everyone else) was merely coasting. Mir joined us later and she is just too good. The path that we took this time was extremely smooth; Rideau Pathway? Anyhow, it was a good one (‘cept a couple of slopes here and there). Nice that there were trees to shade us–helped a tad bit. Today is 39C w humidex. Yesterday was about the same if not worse.
Apres my shower, we went to Darcy McGee’s to meet up w Gabby, Jo, Carol, Amy and Dom (Silq and Marcy went home). Enid joined us for the Haunted Walk tour after ($8/student). It’s interesting to be going to a Haunted Walk from a Christian’s perspective. What’s eerie is not the fact that there are ghosts haunting different historical buildings (like the Museum of Nature–the one we went to on my bday, the 5th flr of the Chateau Laurier, or Chris/Danny’s highschool), but rather that there is potentially evil spirits masquerading as dead spirits in certain places because people half-expect them there or are susceptible to supernatural events (not that I don’t believe they don’t exist–all one’s gotta do is read books by <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0891073906/absolutesubmissi/002-7314781-2414454" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Frank Peretti</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0891074406/qid=997125137/sr=2-1/002-7314781-2414454" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Roger Elwood</a>).
Marc and Aaron joined us for some dessert/food/drinks at Market Diner (/Double Decker’s) for “siew-ye” (great, now I spell like one of “them”-i would useta say, “siu-ye”). I can’t believe it. Of all the times I’ve been at Byward market (btw, it’s probably named after Colonel By), this is my third time there. So, basically, if anyone ever asks, what’s a good place to go, I wouldn’t be able to tell you b/c at Market Diner, the OJ costs $3.25, and the portions are small. Zak’s taste like Mel’s. The Italian place is not worth it either, and the only other one is the Cafe du France (crepes which I haven’t had yet but the mussels were aite).
Okay, I better start working now. I’ve been procrastinating ALL day. Ah well. That’s what a holiday is for I guess.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Wow, it’s such exciting news! 🙂 I remember it was only 1 year ago when Boy (and Michael)’s friend, Anita, was only seeking out of curiousity and would on occasion attend church with us. I also remember thinking that this might be another of Boy’s friend who would attend for awhile and then stop going. I also vaguely remember Boy asking me to pray for her (or maybe I just did on my own), but shamefully, I eventually forgot about it or just wasn’t faithful enough. :(. I’m thankful that God still worked in her life and through the life of others to bring her to Him.Funny how God brings news to me. Tissue (co-op in BC last year) just mentioned that she was talking to him on ICQ–and shortly after, I obtained her ICQ, contacted her and just today, she asked me what I thought of her leading CG. Cell group?! I was like HUH? I thought maybe it was a Singapore thing (b/c she’s there for exchange), but upon further investigation, she told me that it was w IVF! Wow. That was when I found out that she became a Christian last summer! It must’ve been near the end of it. Her testimony is simple, but really touching. Get her to share it with you one day (if you know her). :).
Welcome to the family, Anita! 🙂</blockquote>

<blockquote>I can foresee that (oh boy, I just saw something white float across my eyes–just like what happened last term in the comp lab. Think I’ve been staring at it for too long) in the next week and a half, my schedule will be packed. Brian was just commenting that I could identify how he felt like when he had to leave. Lesse, in the last couple of days, I’ve kept myself occupied once again. On Tues, I finally got to meet the famous AK and his friend Siang from good ‘ol ‘couver. Oddly, I seemed to have picked up on names and location of places in Ottawa that day more than any other b/c Dom was being Tour Guide. I also saw Amy (for maybe only the 4th time this term–she’s on Elijah’s committee as the a part of “Caring”), and Deb (also affectionly known to some as ‘See Lai’) and I were finally introduced to each other. Once again, Canada is small. She turns out to be Sol’s (as in Gabby and Sol from Calgie [Westside Calgary CAC]) older sister! Funny how Chinese churched people seem to be connected to each other under 6 degrees. Dinner at Double Decker’s was aite. The food was good, but the portions are small for the price they charge. At least this time I didn’t have a fever of 102F. MMM. Gelato at Piccolo Grande! Amy kindly gave us 1/2 price on our orders and my, was it soo good. For some odd reason, some of the flavours were non-diary, which would explain why I don’t normally get too uncomfie.P and I had a good prayer meeting time. Dom then drove me to Danny’s to pick up some N64 games. I tried out Perfect Dark yesterday night and Super Mario Kart the night before. I think I prefer racing/competitive games more. Karen L. and her friends wanted to come up for a day so I ended up cleaning my basement up in case they did crash at my place (and because it needed some cleaning anyhow).
I was listening to J’s random nameless CDs (mp3s) today, and one of them had a DDR song on it. Kinda fun and upbeat (keeps me awake at work). Reminds me of last year, when I was more into DDR (playstation only). Seems like people here are less FOB since they don’t do that nor do karoke. I can start feeling the pressure of work though because I’m leaving a lil over a week, and I still have this gimongous manual to finish. It’s to the point where I have to take it home with me and spend 1-3 hours an evening working on it. Thankfully (courtesy of Clearnet), I was able to relax with the movie, <i>10 Things I Hate About You</i>. Strangely though, it reminds me of <i>She’s All That</i>, which I watched 4 or more times last term (because my housemate watched it a lot) so it was an OK movie. I noticed at the end why it was called “10 Things I Hate About You”–but it made sense why the film had that title. I have a habit of always trying to figure out why movies have their titles.
Aside: Woah, I just reread what I wrote. I’m kinda incoherent today. Ah well. Oh yeah, as a side note, esp to J: Marijuana for medical purposes is now legal in Canada. So, just become a doctor and you’ll have legit access :P.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Hrm. It’s the time of the year again. Summer is about to disappear for another year. The sun is starting to setting behind the horizon rather quickly, and the autumn breeze is awaiting, ready to sweep the trees with the colours of–hmm, like a vampire sucking life out of a person–but instead of for blood, for chlorophyll! Well, anyhow, my train of thought just went along the lines of: end of summer. school begins. (groan).Yesterday’s highlight was dinner. Silq, Marc, and Dom came over for dinner. I ended up cooking for 4, which I’m not exactly used to. I hope none of them were poisoned. But then again, Dom had asthma problems, so mebbe . . . :P. Thankfully they came over b/c they helped me clear out most of the stuff in the fridge :). Actually, it’s more fun to cook for other people. Cooking for myself isn’t all that entertaining for some reason. Maybe it’s the anticipation and the suspense of potentially poisioning them. Just kidding. :P.
They studied for their exams (today) and played N64 for awhile. Danny is gonna lend me some really cool games =). Can’t wait! I never had the luxury of owning a game console. But it’s a good thing, b/c it gets quite addictive.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Hmm, Elijah fellowship went camping this weekend, but I didn’t go. It’s a good thing too, b/c I had some business to take care of at home.On Saturday, I actually spent most of the day shopping, strange to say the least. BUT it wasn’t for clothes :). Now why did I go to South Keys? Ah yeah, to look for glow-in-the-dark beads for my cousin, which I didn’t end up getting any b/c one small bag was $7! I think I kinda dragged Marc to come along. It’s a good thing too though, because I didn’t know how to bus it there (and for Dom’s info, no, he didn’t drive). At think the caffeine in the coffee made me really hyper or something b/c that night, I was being the “me” that ppl see when I’m back home around my church friends (namely Mur).
We bumped into “G” (wow, the guy that J was telling me about the time I went to Hog’s Back way back in May/June?), Dennis, and Mr. Clean at the same restaurant. Twas G’s bday. The conversation at our table got quite interesting by the end of the dinner; Keith didn’t know what a lightbulb was. Thanks to Marc’s aunt, I got some real Chinese food (and good seafood: never had “Guai Fa Yue” before but it’s very “wat”) that I haven’t had for awhile :).
We met up w Gravy and Sheree at the Met afterwards, but the driver on the bus must not have driven to Carleton for a very long time, because he took the Dunton Tower route w/o realising that there’d be a fence to block him off. So, he backed up–never sat in a bus that actually went in the reverse direction before. Kinda funny though :). By the time we got there, they were just finishing City Wide Worship, and Gravy quickly drove us downtown to see if we could catch the rest of Benson and Hedge’s Symphony of Fire (in Hull–Italy was the country of the evening). By the time we got there and parked, we saw the last 2 seconds of it. Heh. Ah well. And yes, they smoke pot here too when they watch the fireworks, just like they do in ‘couver. We inhaled some as we were walking to Zak’s. Oh, that must be it! The pot prolly made me high ;þ. I can’t believe it. In the 3 months I’ve been here, it seems like whenever I’m downtown with a bunch of ppl (that’s rare), we all end up going to Zak’s (this is my 4th time). We almost got into a food fight. Actually, it was more of a Double Bubble gum fight. That’s how mature these guys are, and to think that all of them are older than me!
Gravy drove us home, and he ended up missing service the next day. Oops. Heheh. 😛</blockquote>

<span style="font-family: Century Gothic,Tahoma;"><span style="font-family: Century Gothic,Tahoma;"><a name="70"></a></span></span>


<blockquote><a name="70"></a> Wow, it felt like Christmas yesterday! My aunt gave me a small laundry basket full of skincare products and cosmetics (she sells them, so if you ever need to buy any, contact her/me!) :). Although, I don’t normally use this brand <a href="http://www.nuskin.com/canada" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nu Skin</a>, b/c it’s too expensive and well, I don’t have a special liking to this one over the others b/c i have the impression that it’s targeted to ppl who are more “older” than i am), I feel very pampered. I would never spend this much on cosmetics/skin care. The nail polish and lip gloss, a couple of things amongst my many products, are actually quite good. The irony of it all is that it’s my <i>first</i> time ever (aside from the kids stuff) applying nail polish–the technique of applying nail polish is a refined art! I found out very quickly that I have no patience in making myself look and feel any more “beautiful” (or vain). First, I haveta make sure that I apply it w even strokes so not to blotch, then I gotta make sure there are no air bubbles trapped in, and then I gotta wait for like, eternity, before it dries so it won’t muck up or stick to anything else. What a hassle!I had a weird night last night. For some odd reason, I woke up to go to the bathroom (nothing abnormal although I don’t have a habit of doing so in the middle of the night b/c I don’t like walking into things). I remember coming back and thinking that the room was strangely a glow with something greenish near my computer (but it can’t be my computer light b/c usually it’s not too bright). Then, I semi-consciously switched my pillow from the head of the bed to the foot of the bed and slept like that for the rest of the night until I woke up this morning to find myself at the foot of my bed. I remember thinking that I didn’t really need to switch to the foot of the bed, but something kept me from sleeping in my normal position. It’s very strange if you ask me.
Mental Note: Silq shops like a girl. Don’t go shopping with him unless you enjoy browsing and going back and forth between 2 stores. 🙂</blockquote>

<p align="right">Miscellaneous Remarks |07.25.2001|</p>


<span style="font-family: Century Gothic,Tahoma;"><span style="font-family: Century Gothic,Tahoma;"><a name="69"></a></span></span>


<blockquote><a name="69"></a><a name="69"></a> Growl, rumble. Hrm. I think I’m hungry. =). I think one time my stomach growled so loud in class that even Marc heard me. Reminds me of high school when my friend’s stomach would growl like that and I would on occasion. Hee-hee, miss the good old days. Where an A was so easy to get, where lunch was spent in “our” corner, and teachers actually knowing your name and making fun of you in class.I wish UW was in Ottawa (now I know what co-op student blues feels like). But then again, I really like Tim, KWCAC’s pastor–the best I’ve met so far :). <i>America’s Sweethearts</i> was an aite movie. Prolly b/c I don’t really like John Cusack’s acting in many movies, and since it lacked plot . . . but, it was funny anyhow. Surprisingly, it was quite full on a Tues night. I’d thought that people would choose other movies, but nope. What’s w me and movies all of a sudden? In high school, I didn’t really like going to movies b/c you don’t really interact w your friends at them, but somehow, I emerged into this entertainment culture. And the artisy side of me ended up criticising every movie I watched.
<a name="69"></a><a name="69"></a>There was some severe thunderstorms (and incidents of tornados around here too I heard) a couple of days ago. I was really surprised to see that one of the trees in front of my office (bus stop) got struck by lightning (one of the “arms” got “burnt” off from the trunk)–now the whole tree has been sawed down. One of my co-workers joked, “That’s why God created trees! Lightning strikes the tree instead of humans.”
<a name="69"></a><a name="69"></a>Permanent make-up. Hmm, I noticed the advertising a week or so ago. I suppose that’s done for really lazy people but at the same time, I wonder what happens when they decide they don’t want the style of fashion anymore. It almost reminds me of tattooing. Wonder if the same biblical principle applies to permanent make-up as it does to tattoos.
<a name="69"></a> Seems like the worm, w32.sircam.worm@mm, is quite popular these days. A couple of my friends have received more than 1 copy, and I even helped remove one of my friend’s before receiving one myself. Thankfully, I knew what it was before opening it . . . so, readers be on the lookout for funny e-mails.</blockquote>

<p align="right">Heat Wave |07.23.2001|</p>


<span style="font-family: Century Gothic,Tahoma;"><span style="font-family: Century Gothic,Tahoma;"><a name="68"></a></span></span>


<blockquote>Happy Birthday Silq! 🙂 Today is Silq’s berfday, but we celebrated it on Saturday instead. Actually, only 1 of us went out of Dom, Marc and I. The rest of the people that went I didn’t really know, but it was fun meeting all of Silq’s friends (some again, some for first time–prolly spelled some names wrong too): Winnie, D, Will, Hoi, Sunny, Shawna(?), Carly, Sue, Tam, Dennis, Cheung, Cindy, Trent, Alana and a couple of others that I’ve seem to have neglected I think. People got the berfday people (Winnie, Tam, Silq) some pretty cool gifts like a cell phone, Joy cam, Tommy girl kit, lifesized cardboard version of Sandra Bullock as Miss Congeniality (for Silq of course!) . Marc, Dom, and I got Silq a <i>pretty</i> gift. Uh huh. It’s similar to what you can find at La Senza online. Um. Hmm. That’s not right. I better take off that link, in case some of you think I’m endorsing soft porn or something. It went along the theme of “getting in touch w his feminine side”–thus, the VHS version of <i>Center Stage</i>, which I later found out that he took ballet lessons and since he enjoys “chick flicks” . . . it’s perfect! 🙂 He refused to wear it though, so Hoi kindly volunteered to be our model. The funny thing is that it was my first time purchasing anything at La Senza–and it wasn’t even for myself, much less for a girl! ;)Yeah, the BBQ was pretty good. At the beginning, when there were only a few of us, some psycho woman was sharing the gazebo (or as Silq calls it: “Gazobi”) with us (b/c twas raining for a bit). A couple of them were throwing a vball around and the a lil oversized lady starts to stare at us, repeatedly saying, “play ball . . . this is a gazebo . . .” At one point, this woman (not a lady, my mistake) starts making a gun gesture to her head in a “you’re cuckoo” motion and then taking her paring knife and making stabbing motions towards Silq :\. Not long after she walks off (b/c she can’t stand us I’m sure), some wedding party arrives and stands around for say 45 mins, before a couple of them guys came up and said that they had a permit. Dennis or Lana asked to see the permit (we have the right to, and because they didn’t say anything before, they just stood around so we already set up and all), and the white guy was nice about it and tried to let us know that they were not going to be long, cept the Italian looking dude (one of the groomsmen/best man), comes up to us and says, “If you don’t move your stuff now, I’ll move it for you.” Yeah, like we’re really scared. Since they have a cheap wedding ceremony at Andrew Hayden Park and all, it won’t take much to dirty their suits. Personally, I don’t have anything against them, cept for that guy, and the 2 women who stared us down when we were walking away. But if I was to get married, and even if I was to have a small wedding (which I probably wouldn’t mind, as long as it’s not in a courthouse, city hall, or a small park), I would not take pictures or hold it at a place with a bunch of Asians in the background having a BBQ. 😛
Yesterday’s heat was worse than the day at the BBQ. I thought it was humid and hot enough, but yesterday was 34C, and today is 42C with humidex. Rollerblading at that heat wasn’t a very good idea, but it was nevertheless fun, and there was no major wipeouts (well 1, but that was b/c there was a bump on the road and I wasn’t paying attention to it–I was too busy avoiding the cyclists). Marc and I bladed around the Carleton/Rideau Canal area–hope the self-taken photos turn out :). The tunnels at Carleton are awesome for blading tho (illegally)! 😛 The last part–the “lil hill” that Marc warned me of, wasn’t as “l’il” or “fun” as the other ones. The other hills are nothing like the ones in ‘couver. I do not accelerate on them to a point where I cannot stop so it’s rather fun. But the last one I kinda went out of control (side entrance to Carleton), but good thing there was grass to stop me! Helped paint my relatives’ kitchen after–looks really refreshing now in that mint green 🙂</blockquote>

<p align="right">Girls’ Night Out |07.19.2001|</p>


<span style="font-family: Century Gothic,Tahoma;"><span style="font-family: Century Gothic,Tahoma;"><a name="67"></a></span></span>


<blockquote><a name="67"></a><a name="67"></a> Firstly, I got bitten by mosquitoes in 2 spots (one I killed after it got me) on the night that Silq and I were shooting hoops til 2230h or later. Grrr. :(Last night was highly interesting. ‘Twas Yoshi’s last day here (she went back to ‘couver today). Renee organised a girl’s night out w the “geeks” (2 Engineer majors, 1 CS, 1 technically-inclined English [ARTS!] major, and 1 other): Mir, Renee, Yosh, and myself. We met up at Rideau and bumped into Moeman. He was on his way home. So anyhow, we went to the various counters to get our free makeovers :\. I chose Shishedo (that was the only other option) b/c I don’t really have a high impression of Clinique and Christian Dior required you to purchase a product. Elizabeth Arden was not an option b/c they d’n offer any after 1715h. I think that’s the only brand I’ve ever used (aside for trying Clinique products). Ah yeah. I know, most of EA’s (no, not <i>Electronic Arts</i>) stuff is targeted for the “older” women (cept maybe <i>Sunflowers</i>). All the girls looked good after. I didn’t like the blue eyeshadow on me. I thought it was a l’il too extreme. And so did Silq apparently, when I bumped into him and Dennis. So, on my way out of the mall, I rubbed some of it off. The blue hue looked fine after some of it was removed and in the evening light. But anyhow, I don’t think I wanna do this for fun again b/c it takes too much of my patience. I haveta sit still in a chair and wait. And then, I haveta go home and remove it all–which requires effort and patience as well. Yup, conclusion? Don’t like make-up. Besides, it’s not good for the skin anyhow. 😉 I was surprised to learn that the majority of us there d/n even wear make-up on a regular basis. And I’m not the only one who doesn’t own or carry a compact!
<a name="67"></a><a name="67"></a>Dinner was a some Italian place in downtown (by the Market), which was a tad overpriced for the quality/portions. Ah well. Farewells were exchanged at Yosh’s place. Marc kindly picked me up from Place, and drove me to his house so that I could try on his brother’s pair of blades. Very tight fit, but it’s good. Woo-hoo! I just purchased a pair of blades–all for a mere $20! 🙂 Under normal circumstances, I don’t tend to buy used skates from just anyone, esp for that price (hard boots, jr skates)– but considering they were in very good condition (minimal scratches/brake usage, etc.) [unlike what my brother did to my pair in ‘couver; he wore out the bearings/wheels, major scratches from stopping/wipe outs, and completely wasted the brakes–come to think of it, i think he should’ve paid for this one to replace mine ;P] and I could help Keith out, I decided to go for them. Maybe by the end of the summer, I will be able to stop properly and have no fear of going downhill anymore. ;). Whoops, another thing that I’ve accumulated since I’ve got here. Oh well.
<a name="67"></a> Heheh, as I was waiting for my unreliable bus (85) to Rideau yesterday, and I saw a RICED Neon! heheheh, twas sooo funny. a car worth a l’il more than $10 000 Cdn, and it’s riced! Lights were all changed, and it had racing stripes! Heeheee . . . Ottawa is such a funny place for riced cars. But what was odd, was that I finally got a chance to see an imported car on the road, where the driver is sitting on the right of the car. And speaking of cars, I can’t believe that I don’t know how to drive a standard!! At times where it matters too! Like when my cousin offered me the keys to his <a href="http://www.mazda.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Miata</a>, so that I could take it for a spin. Sigh. Mental note: learn to drive a standard!
Wow, I finally spent the majority of my day with girls. Heheh.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Wow, I haven’t shot hoops in many, many years (since Grade 11/12 or 1st year). I think the only vivid memory I have of the last time we played basketball outdoors was in Chinese school, w/ a bunch of our guy friends, and my sister (senior high). In early second year, Ben A and Vonne shot some baskets in the gym but it’s good to be shooting again :). Also beneficial that my cousins have a mobile basketball net in their driveway! Yep. Aaron (contrary to Dom’s belief that I was w Marc this evening :þ) came over to shoot some baskets until we got infested by mosquitoes. Apparently, mosquitoes are attracted to CO2–or at least according to Silq (which would explain why we all got stung at paintball, since we pumped out CO2 from our guns. Silq’s style of play (dribbles, rebounds/lay-ups), reminds me of how my brother plays.Actually, I enjoyed 2 good meals today that were from generous hearts–Thai food (again, same restaurant) from my company b/c it was the VP’s birthday, and Chinese food (at Chu Sing) from Aaron. MMM. Thanks Aaron! 🙂
The Thai culture has some really strange tea. It’s quite tasteless, but it smells and has a taste of Mr. Clean (not Simon, but the real thing) or some household cleaner. Very strong, but tastes diluted. I’m not too fond of it, even though I do like lemon in water. I ordered Pad Thai this time, some fried noodles that have remnants of Hoisin sauce (which may very well be, considering Chinese people run this place on Carling Ave.). I think they forgot to put the spice in it b/c it wasn’t spicy at all. I think I will stick to the curry next time ;).
At Chu Sing, I think the waitress expected me to know how to read Chinese b/c she had “tou-chan” (set menus) in Chinese for me to choose from (A-D). I didn’t take the time to guess at all the dishes to choose from, but I did recognise “ging-dou-yok-pai” and b/c Aaron says that he eats that stuff, it would be something we know, so we ordered B :). Sigh. I really need to learn how to read and write properly :P.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Warning: speedbump ahead. LONG read.


<blockquote><i>Remember your Creator in the days of your youth, before the days of trouble come and the years approach when you will say, “I find no pleasure in them”–before the sun and the light and the moon and the stars grow dark, and the clouds return after the rain; when the keepers of the house tremble, and the strong men stoop, when the grinders cease because they are few, and those looking through the windows grow dim; when the doors to the street are closed and the sound of grinding fades; when men rise up at the sound of birds, but all their songs grow faint; when men are afraid of heights and of dangers in the streets; when the almond tree blossoms and the grasshopper drags himself along and desire no longer is stirred. Then man goes to his eternal home and mourners go about the streets.</i></blockquote>


Wow, yeah, it sure is hard to appreciate anything when you’re old (just like what Ecclesiastes 12 [NIV] says). I, amongst many others, felt so sore in our quad muscles today, that we barely were able to climb up or down a set of stairs. We felt so old. I had no desire to walk about the neighbourhood, or even walk home from the bus stop. And right when I reached my final destination, I crashed on my bed, and didn’t wake up til at least 3 hours later when I had to feed the dog.Paintball. All worth it; although I spent 30 dollars in total and voluntarily obtained some bruises (at least 10, with one the size bigger than a toonie that resulted most likely from a wipe out and 4 mosquito bites–2 on forehead, 1 on chin, 1 on hand, and one painful bite from something on my thumb) Thankfully, there was no major injuries on me–unlike welts (w blood) on Matt, Aaron, Andy, Garvin and some others. There were 20 of us in total, mostly from Elijah Fellowship. We played 6 fields (I stayed for 5 fields, totalling 9 games) but I don’t know who I exactly nailed (though I know for certain that I solidly sniped 2 players). I know for sure that I managed to hit Ben Allen smack in the face, when he was defending the fort in the tower for one of the games (didn’t know it was him til after the game). Actually, that was sweet. Although our team lost, the adrenaline in that particular one somehow actually led me to attempt to attack the fort (w the knowledge that it was 1 girl vs. 6 guys or so). That game was weird though b/c all the guys ended up getting shot on my team and only Chau and I were left (the only 2 girls out of 3 that went). She attempted to get in at first but had to surrender. Eventually, I was the only one left, and the ref said that there was only less than 30 secs left. Since I had nothing to lose, and that it would look really cowardly if I didn’t try to do anything, I decided to make a dash for it. The opposing team ended up ended up wondering why the 30 secs didn’t expire but the ref said that since I was attacking, he’d continue the game :).
That round, I got one of my first bruises. Some guy ended up nailing me in the shoulders through the crack in the wall. For a moment, I thought that I was out, but the ref said that it didn’t count (yeah, I forgot about that rule: no cheapshots through cracks). I eventually found out that Andy was guarding the entrance and I think he was the one who ended up nailing me both through the cracks, and when I moved to enter. Twas a good game :). The rest of the games, I either died by getting shot, we won, or I ran out of ammo (last game). Okay, enough limelight on me.
Often I got hit, but the paint didn’t splatter but I keep forgetting to check, and because it’s more painful if the paintballs don’t break on impact, I think that I’m “dead” but by the time I walk to the dead zone and discover that, it’s too late to go back in). What I don’t appreciate is when people don’t play by the rules. There were a couple of instances when my teammates complained of cheapshots through cracks, or even more so, when certain people (well mainly 1, in the fort game), walked to the dead zone with his arms raised in the air (when we all had a good opportunity to fire, but we didn’t seeing that he was “dead”) and later commented to one of the “dead”: , “oh look! i don’t have any paint on me!”, walked back in w/o a gun, and took the flag. Later on, the ref brags to his co workers by saying, “this was the first time i saw someone do that. he had no gun, and he wasnt running in. he <i>walked</i> in; he looked like he was limping in, as if he had no purpose in life!” Heheh, I thought that statement was rather funny. The ref told Andy that he was lucky and that he better watch his back from then on. I think the ref was right b/c I saw him today with a big welt (giant zit!) on his forehead; think he ended up getting killed in one of the last games (after I left).
I had a really good time with my co-worker on Friday. She’s a really cool gal. She took me out for some Thai food (yummy!) down the street and we ended up talking a whole lot. I think she was a really good teacher when she did teach b/c she’s such an encouraging person :). I remember that when she first joined the team, Andy and I didn’t know what to think of her b/c she’s a take charge/initiative-taker type of person. She’s one of the younger ones there (28), if not <i>the youngest</i> after Andy. Let’s just say that my actions at work don’t get unnoticed by others. She said that she’d keep me if it was up to her. Well, it would be extremely nice to continue working with them, and entertaining too. Some people at work just amuse me.
Have you ever tried to play cat and mouse? It’s a very fun game to watch. You know how a cat, before eating a mouse, plays with their prey and taunts them? Well, it seems to be a very effective, even if the cat isn’t too active about the whole thing (ie. not even wanting to eat it or play w his prey)–just the fact that it’s a cat and b/c of him being a cat, it intimidates the mouse whenever he senses the presence of the cat. Very amusing.
A realisation hit me today. I have less than 4 weeks left with these people. Wow. I may never see them again, and this summer has gone by soooo quickly! I think I want to come back next summer ;). I like it here more than Toronto. Even though I’ve never been there for an extended amout of time before.</blockquote>

<blockquote><a name="64"></a> <i>Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within</i> was definitely worth my $9! Not a disappointment at all. Although there were parts of it where the graphics were a bit lacking (stiff characters or square pixels leftover), the music and the computer animation was done extremely well (IMHO) –but then again in terms of graphics, as a American movie it’s extremely well done, but I’m sure for a Japanese film, it’s only mediocre. The plot was lacking, but the philosophical fantasy world made it strange, but interesting nevertheless. At first it reminded me of <i>the Matrix</i>, but then it got really weird. Hope kids don’t buy into it–though they seem to imitate everything they like. Usually, I don’t like movies w/o plots, but the music, art, philosophy, etc. made up for it :). I wouldn’t mind getting the soundtrack for this movie just b/c the music was good athestetically (hmm, that wrd might not be used in the right context here). I haven’t really played the game (maybe once), but it was not too hard to follow (although Silq b//c confused at the end).<a name="64"></a> What I thought was especially neat was the idea of recording dreams! I know I have dreams that are extremely confusing and abstract, but some of them are good (like this one). But at the same time, if I was able to record some of my dreams, I wouldn’t want to see it again because they seem to be quite inappropriate (or violent). What’s weird though was when we walked out of the theatre last night, many many (I mean like Egypt plague in Exodus) bugs were all over our cars. At first, Marc thought that they were grasshoppers, but they didn’t hop. They flew. They also had tails like scorpions. Josh thinks they look like baby dragonflies. Aaron guessed that they were larvae. What no one seems to know is how they got there. It was very bizarre and eerie, considering we just finished watching FF.
Ah yeah, my fonts are back to normal now =). Uncle Ben (from BAC, professor and head of dept at BCIT) helped me w my coding, although the logic of it doesn’t really make sense :P. Ah well, at least it works.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Hehe, I think my cousins are starting to warm up to me and vice versa. I spent my evening w them yesterday playing (or learning to) tennis. I don’t know why I’ve never actually picked it up as I like to play most racquet sports (even table tennis though one uses a paddle instead). There’s a court in the park that’s right near our house, but we got kicked out after awhile, when the monitorees came by to check if we were members :P. As the rest of them went home, I wandered around the block and discovered 2 sets of monkey bars at the elementary school. :). Hehehe. I think JJ knows what I’m up to. Anyhow, I’m nicely a tad sore today. It feels good. =).They discovered my Painter program on my computer and took turns (as much as kids can take “turns”) on using it; trying to see what kind of games I had (none), and watched bits and pieces of my DVDs/VCDs. The boys were in awe of my lava lamp–which they commissioned me to buy for them. Hehehe. Strangely enough, I miss hanging out w real kids. 🙂 I’m starting to remember my French now too, which is a good sign.</blockquote>

<blockquote>If it weren’t for verses like Ephesians 4:29 or Ephesians 5:4 (NIV),


<blockquote><i>“Nor should there be obscenity, foolish talk or coarse joking, which are out of place, but rather thanksgiving.” </i></blockquote>


I’d prolly be more liberal in my language. Sometimes, milder language just doesn’t accurately depict the picture you want to paint. Saying that something is fudged or screwed up, just doesn’t sound as extreme as reality; the clash of sharp ice hitting against the burning flames of fire when it’s not meant to be. However if I was to use this “dialect” of English/Chinese, unless someone is really an illegitimate child, a donkey, or a female dog, I would prolly not call them that. The coarse joking . . . hmm . . . hence I stay away from movies like <i>There’s Something About Mary</i>, <i>AP2</i>, <i>Me, Myself & Irene</i>, <i>American Pie</i>. I hear jokes in real life enough, why waste $ and indulge in more of them on screen? 😛 And if I lived out both, my mother would prolly have my head and say that I’m no lady.Ah yeah, on the topic of being a lady. I think it’s partially my upbringing as a child. My sister useta be the tomboy in the family, but she’s more into the whole “girl” scene than I am. I don’t understand how people can shop with other girls for 3 or more hours (and try on everything!), or find makeovers fun. I might check out the makeover thing next week for the pics, but yeah make-up on a regular basis? Okay, yeah it highlights your features nicely if it’s put on properly, but to find good quality make-up that doesn’t destory your skin in the process is quite a costly HM thing to do. Funny though, as a 12 year old, I wanted to use make-up and get my ears pierced and the works, but for some reason, now I don’t really care anymore. Maybe it’s b/c my parents said that I wasn’t allowed to use any til I was 16 and no piercing til I was 19. Or maybe I’m just an impatient person and looking at myself at the mirror isn’t to appealing to begin w. Admittedly, I probably know the least of everything when it comes to cosmetics.
Yeah, that thought hit me esp when Gravy made a comment about how painful mascara must be to put on (re: Mel Gibson trying on mascara). I didn’t really make a reply to his comment b/c even though I’m positive I’ve had experiences w mascara (wedding, grad, etc.), I just can’t remember the last time I’ve put it on :P. Okay, enough of this part of my life. 😉 You prolly think I’m a really unattractive person now ;P ah well. I’ll just let God do the work :). After all, what could be more beautiful than His creation (well, until we go screw it up as we always tend to do).
I noticed yesterday, that my HTML table coding was all wrong (I mixed up the orders of “TR” and “TD”) so when I went to fix it, my font face messed up into this fat Tahoma-looking font (which I now believe it’s the right font face, but not right size). Hopefully, it would be fixed soon [once I discover how to do it–unless one of you readers can help me? :)]</blockquote>

Tis such a big relief to be able to use my computer again w.o having it crash on me w a VXD error for every 2 or more programs I open. We were waiting for MJ to help me reset the BIOS settings that one of us messed up or troubleshoot why my computer refuses to restart/shut down properly. In my impatience, I suddenly realise that my TYAN manual might give me a hint. Although it did not fix my problems right away, I used my old method of trial and error (usually it’s either a) it works perfectly again or b) i’ve screwed myself over) and consulted the MS troubleshooting tech help pages that Andy found/printed for me awhile ago. Turns out that after I deselected the autoconfig.ini and autoexec.bat and whatever else files, it restarted just fine (and consequently, upon reselecting them, my computer was okay w it too)! :).

I haven’t had such good meals in sooo long. We had Japanese food (Moocher, Mumbles, Silq, Leith, and myself) downtown. And speaking of food, I haven’t warned you about East Side Mario’s salads yet (esp the one in Kanata and if you’re ordering the same as another person at the same table). Yeah, so one time, Andy, myself, and 4 others from the company went out for lunch and 3 of us ordered the same SoHo salad. Well guess what?! The first place was kinda oily. The second was with a puddle of oil, and mine? I think I got the bottom of the “mixing bowl” — because my greens were soggy with oil dressing and I had a flood at the bottom of my plate!

Yesterday, Mir and I went to Café Crêpes de France (or something like that) and had 6 plates (amongst the 2 of us) of all-you-can-eat mussels for only 12,95$ (per person)! We tried all 4 sauces and liked the curry sauce the most. Yesterday evening was highly interesting, because strange to admit, that was my first night out (in Ottawa) spent w a girl exclusively. At least I think t’was.
Atlantis was a surprisingly good movie. I don’t tend to watch very many Disney movies anymore (yet my all-time favourite is still Beauty and the Beast), but this one was very amusing. I could tell from the start that Milo was voiced by Michael J. Fox. Silvercity made a booboo though. They started showing Evolution instead and everything was all squished together.

<blockquote>God’s sense of humour in action yet again. Although Dom prolly doesn’t think so. He prolly will blame it someone else. No, it didn’t rain on Canada Day, but the winds did pick up–to the point where the fireworks were cancelled. AND the temperature dropped down to ~6C from 20+ C. Most of us, except for Marc (who brillantly [in this sense] somehow ended up in the Museum of Civilisation), froze our butts (and the rest of our body) off for 2 hours waiting in vain for the fireworks.Ben A. came up for the weekend (along w a whole bunch of others). We spent Saturday in Montreal avec Josh and Dom. That’s the furthest east in Canada that I’ve ever been. Montreal isn’t too “exciting” (during the day I suppose). Thankfully, they came along so we didn’t get lost :P. We endured the heat at St. Joseph Oratory (not St. Thomas as J thinks), but when we got to Mont Royal park, it started pouring. We met up with Karin (finally!), Stephanie, Rebekah, and Patrick. They took us to the Old Montreal port. The streets reminds me so much of Gastown in ‘couver. We had lunch in Chinatown and dinner at Schwartz`s–some place that sells really good smoked meat.
What I still don’t understand, is the Catholic tradition. Why do they charge people $1 for offering candles (or whatever they are), but they charge $4 for healing candles? Does God really care how much you pay for your faith?! The reason I’m mentioning this is because I saw the walls of crutches, symbols of how many were healed. St. Joseph’s is massive btw. I would not want to be the one kneeling up the steps in prayer on a rainy day.
I won’t mention about the lecture I received from the landlady. Let’s just say that although she is concerned about the affairs of other people, she really has no right to play the role of “mom” in this sense.</blockquote>

Fireworks, road trips, people; it’s gonna be hectic! That’s when the storm will pick up again. Speaking of eyes, I managed to stuff my contacts into my eyes after the millionth try (but this time I think Chris’ tutoring helped b/c I got them in after 30 hr).What I don’t understand is how guys (mostly) don’t mind spending so much money at the arcades. Okay, I admit that most games can be very addictive. And if all the games were free, I’d be practising too (so I can kick butt! ;P). Flukedly, I managed to win a couple of rounds/games at Street Fighter 3 with J (and almost beat Marc as well)–but J hasn’t played it before, so I guess twas fair :). Surprisingly though, I also managed to beat (at the very last sec) Jon M. at Daytona–he used manual transmission and for me, automatic. I cheapedly outraced Marc, but that’s b/c I rammed into him 😛 heheh.
WWF. Spending a smoky 3 hours at BP to watch WWF is not really my idea of fun. But Marc cooked us dinner so I’m not complaining. Thanks Marc–that “Bak Chi Gai” [or whatever it really is] was good. 🙂 Ironically, we spent the next day at Local Heroes catching RAW as well. But we had good laffs b/c “Silq” was there.

<blockquote>Although this section of my website is prolly the most “secular” of all, I gotta share this verse w/ you that I read in my devotions last night. It’s prolly taken out of context, but it’s nevertheless, very amusing (something that Zeke would prolly vouch for since all he ever finds are verses on “increasing in number”, “figs”, and “drink and be merry”). This verse is taken from Ecclesiastes 10:19 (NIV):


<blockquote>“A feast is made for laughter, and wine makes life merry, but money is the answer for everything.”</blockquote>


muhahahah. xþHeehee. Oh boy, oh boy. Aussie Frank is funny. He apparently told his mom that I was Dom’s gf. HAHA. Like Dom said, “Noooo.” Both him and I have different ppl in mind, so that’s <i>completely</i> outta the question in this context :). We both cracked up though when Frank’s mom asked Dom today, and so did Jon and Marc when we told them :P.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Yup, that was what my fever was at one point of the day. During lunch, when I left work, it was blazing hot outside (but w one cool breeze). Luckily, the 31C temperature did not affect me in any way because I was experiencing cold chills. All the heat/sun did to me was try to warm me up. That was good . . . until I “passed” out on top of my bed (w/o covers on) w/o having any energy to take any tynenol and then woke up to find that I was extremely hot and had a temperature of 102.1 F (I was like what?! So I retook it again, and it dropped to 101.8 F). Then I also attempted to answer my calls.Yes, my friends are really, really nice! =) They kept calling/icqing me to see how I was doing throughout most of yesterday and today. Do I get this in Waterloo/Toronto/Vancouver? Not to this extent =) Thanks guys [and P for asking ’bout me]. Okay, I know you Vancouver/Toronto/Waterloo ppl are prolly protesting by now. Yes, I know that some of you do care and I thank you too [like the ppl I hung round w during the past Christmas]! But to not have heard from anyone (aside from L.Mo/Chris/Ron and my family) from home for at 6 months now is kinda disappointing, y’know (and if you call me now, well it doesn’t count b/c i’m mentioning it).
I went to class on Monday expecting it to be good (cuz it was supposedly on ethics). Too bad I got sick yesterday, else I’d go today cuz it’s on an even better topic: breaching of contracts! =). Ah well. I almost fell asleep in the first part of the class–that was my worst one yet. Tho, I learned lots, nevertheless. Especially on what’s hot in the gay community. . . .some “leather cleaner” that I’d rather not get into (and that the teacher knows from experience or something “trust me, you only need 1/2 a can”). But also learned something else, something that is plausible/feasible for J especially:


<ol><li>get hard liquor/liqueur</li>


    

<li>slap some on your face</li>


    

<li>let alcohol evaporate off [which in process you will also feel burning sensation]</li>


    

<li>then you’ll have a nice lovely aftershave smell</li>


    

<li>and for ppl like J, drink the rest =). heheh.</li>


</ol>


You know what else that I could consider? It’s not illegal to sell notes to students (or against Carelton University’s policy) and some students make up to $400! Heheh, since I “enjoy” sitting in classes, I might as well earn cash as well. Too bad I didn’t think of that earlier; else I could make an offer to Conky. Heheheh. 😛</blockquote>

<span style="font-family: Century Gothic,Tahoma;"><span style="font-family: Century Gothic,Tahoma;"><a name="53"></a></span></span>


<blockquote>Father’s Day should’ve been a normal, every day Sunday for me, but it turned out to the complete opposite. First, I was kinda helping out w AV at church for most of the worship service. I haven’t done that in a while. Both sitting upstairs in the sanctuary and doing AV. Well, not really doing, kinda just observing. My brother useta do the AV and at BAC, I picked up some of the basics that I needed to know/look out for. I think one day, to keep from being distracted, I should just sit by myself or something. But if I do that, I just might fall asleep b/c I know that no one is keeping me accountable :P. Surprisingly enough, I haven’t even felt the need to fall asleep at OCAC yet. :)In the afternoon, I ended up spending some time at Dom and Marc’s places in Orleans. They have pretty “homey” homes. And they have a basement that they can chill in (especially in this dreadful heat). The neighbourhood has some really nice parks and it seems pretty peaceful safe. Ah yeah, I keep seeing examples of how nice Ottawa residents are here. They are easy to differentiate btwn TO, Montreal, or ‘couver residents–they lack this cold attitude :). And bus drivers? I wish the bus drivers are like this everywhere else. They practically stop anywhere to pick you up and drop you off.
Dom took his family out for dinner to “Duk-Bak-Lay” for Father’s Day and invited me along. Thanks Dom ;9! I have not yet felt sooo full here in Ottawa until last night. I ate soo much (or so it seemed but I was hungry again around 1 am :P). The funny thing is that one of the dishes was soo badly translated: You Choy, became in English, “Vegetable Oil”. Yes, they may have cooked it w Vegetable oil, but I’m quite sure that wasn’t what they were trying to convey :).
I was supposed to go and watch Tomb Raider (free! but catch was only offered at midnight) this weekend but they ended up changing the dates, and I had to work the next day—not to mention that I needed to go home to call my father to wish him a happy father’s day too :P.
Aside: The power went out in our neighbourhood this morning. But as I passed Woodroffe and Carling, I once again realised why it’s deemed the most dangerous intersection in Ottawa. That’s because immediately after the lights, the LCBO parking lot is there. Most cars haveta slow down in the middle of the intersection for cars that need to turn into the parking lot. who’s smart idea was that?!</blockquote>

<blockquote>My first and my last time most likely. In retrospect though, that was quite an excitement. Anyhow, always, always listen to your conscience when it makes you doubt. HA. Well, anyhow, J was telling me how the drag races goes on for like 2 months at the same location and people are starting to get spooked. So I’m like, fine, I’m not going to watch anymore b/c of the big risk. Nevertheless, he convinces me that he’s exaggerating, so I agree. At the back of my mind, something is naggin me, so I remember not to carry any ID on me (for some weird reason); at home, I changed from sandals to runners (in case I had to make a break for it), and was thinking of wearing blk (to be less visible). Once Frank, J, and I got there, I realised that if I needed to really make a dash for some reason, I needed to place my phone someplace, so I gave it to J–gotta love those pants! 😛 Anyhow, the cops came. Nothing actually happened though, and thank God that we did not have an illegally modified car, or did anything too illegal (weed, booze, etc.). I must say though, the cops in Ottawa are <i>extremely</i> nice. If I was the cop, I’d be one w an attitude, especially for such a huge event as this. ‘cept, he was very civil and politely asked us questions and told us to go home. Tho’ I haven’t been in such a risky situation before, I have a huge feeling that if I was in ‘couver or in Toronto, we’d get it for sure.I guess Ottawa will be <i>the</i> place for me–for all firsts:


<ul><li>paintball</li>


    

<li>clubbing</li>


    

<li>racing</li>


    

<li>outdoor ice-skating (Winterlude)</li>

<span style="font-family: Century Gothic,Tahoma;"><span style="font-family: Century Gothic,Tahoma;"><a name="51"></a></span></span>


<blockquote>Sometimes I wonder why I go to prayer meetings, besides knowing that it’s “right” to–maybe it’s the person that I am, but how can I ever really “open” up to anyone? A couple of my closest friends in the past have complained of the “walls” I build around me, and the “masks” I hid behind (one for every occasion). It’s funny tho, I look upon my prayer life, and I find that I tend to pray more for others, more often than I pray for myself. That in itself is not bad, but when I neglect my own spiritual well-being . . . so anyhow, I’ve always felt uncomfortable praying as a group, especially “popcorn” style (i’m anal:=task -oriented/structured profile type), but the sharing last night at P&P (praise and prayer) somehow made it seem less “bad”–and more of a cell group :).HOT! Feels a lil like HK! …. 40.1 C (w humidex) is 20 C more than what I’m useta! ‘couver only get a max of high 28C in the summers; and that’s rare in itself. AC is soo nice in this weather. It’s even worth going to class (hahah, mackenzie building has it, but not Dom’s class in Loeb). AC at Man’s Kitchen is nice too–I met almost all of CU there! I think I learn a lot of street sense in class. Never anything about Business Law itself :P.
Words of advice:


<ul><li>Treat your friends as if one day they’ll b//c your enemies. Especially your neighbour. And especially if you own a business or write off personal things as business ventures. You may get audited one day and you’ll get screwed over.</li>


    

<li>If your “story” is full of holes, tis really full of “swiss cheese”</li>


    

<li>Always, always clean your pop can prior to drinking outta it, especially if you are buying it from a hot dog stand (look at the melted ice; full of bacteria). Actually, just never buy anything from a hot dog stand.</li>


    

<li>Be careful of HIV+ people (I’m sure you know about that already)–on average, 1 HIV+ person will spread it to 37 others in their lifetime. Remember that in Canada, in an average year, 1 out of 1000 immigrants are infected w HIV, and we let in 24000 in a year or so.</li>


    

<li>Nortel will lay of another 20 000 of employees soon. Just wait and watch. :\ Thank God that I don’t work for them.</li>


</ul>


Aside: I believe that lil kids innately are curious about Jesus. Today, some co workers at work were discussing that their kids are somewhat interested in Bible stories and all and that some of them are asking their parents (who are not religious) whether doing one thing would make Jesus mad, etc. Some remind me that others are watching my daily act of conduct, even to saying grace before drinking bbltea =). Keeping me accountable even though they are seeking. This also reminds me to pray for them :).</blockquote>

<blockquote>It’s been quiet in the past couple of days. I stayed home, watched some GTO, and worked on my redesigns for my webpage (which at the moment, is still offline b/c I’m not done/satisfied w/ it yet). I think the busy life in TO (things happenin’ every sec) must’ve made my life here in Ottawa more peaceful or something :P. One highlight of my evening, was that my “sam-yee” called me from bby, bc to wish me a happy belated bday and my 3-year old cousin kept wanting to talk to me! hehhe. he reminds me of my brother when he was that age. so cute [of course, only when they don’t cry] :P!Dom and Bri tells me that OCAC and all the CCC churches use Welch’s grape juice for their holy communion . . . okay, so I stand corrected. Maybe my taste buds are just screwed up. :P. Or maybe they dilute it or something . . . it’s not even deep purple lookin’ . . . =P. . .
T’was my parent’s 25th wedding anniversary yesterday. Apparently my mom was really happy that day (b/c of what my dad thought up). I didn’t get a chance to personally congratulate them b/c I called twice and my brother had the decency to hang up on me the last time around (“fax coming! gotta go!” *click*) — when my mother was actually available. That’s actually quite amazing though. I think my patience would be stretched thin if I was to live w. the same person for 25 years–at least for now anyhow.</blockquote>

<blockquote><a name="49"></a><a name="49"></a> Warning: long log ahead. watch for bump.Yee-Min and Ruth got married this weekend. The wedding ceremony was really interesting, especially since the couple actually kissed, the songs were sung really well (by diff ppl), and Pastor Isaac was good as usual; the reception was good too–the food, the whole “banquet” thing–cept the PA system lacked in quality (so no one could really hear anything), and not very many interesting “games” were played. For some reason though, I started feeling really old. I know I’m not, but to attend a wedding ceremony and banquet without my parents feels weird. We were jokingly saying that Yee-Min broke the ice, so everyone will soon follow suit :).
<a name="49"></a><a name="49"></a>I talked to many people this weekend, which I haven’t seen or spoken to in a very long time. I said hello to Pastor Isaac/Auntie Anita (and baby Ethan) at MCAC. I finally got to see what my cousin’s cousin looks like 🙂 [i useta refer pastor isaac as isaac goh goh cuz he knew me since i was very small, and he was my very first piano teacher]. At the banquet, I also bumped into Kelvin C, a brother in Christ, whom I met at JMC in 1997 (and never seen since then)–we chatted briefly . . . he kinda looks different for some reason (not in a bad way tho.). At the wedding ceremony, I also chatted with Lori L., someone who moved to ‘Sauga from my home church (BAC).
<a name="49"></a><a name="49"></a>T3C is this big lookin’ church, that kinda reminds me of Fraserlands in ‘couver, or a school of some sort. Some ppl that I know, have some beefs about the building itself. Since I’m useta big contemporary style churches, I don’t see anything wrong w it. However, I don’t think that’s a church I would want to call “home”–why? Well for one, worship is a big part of my “criteria” list. The worship reminded me of SCAC or our style of worship back in the days. The songs were dated 1985 or so (I only knew how to sing 2: The Servant King, and Make Me a Servant). The communion was interesting though. The “bread” was just crumbled tasteless crackers (I’m thinking that it’s probably cheaper; not Premium Plus kind either), but the “cup” was actually Welch’s grape juice! Well, at least it tastes like it. There are hardly any churches that use Welch’s anymore just because it’s soo expensive (but really good quality!)–KWCAC/OCAC uses some form of diluted grape lookin’ stuff.
<a name="49"></a><a name="49"></a>I bumped into Garvin (from OCAC), and Melissa (from Carleton) there. Lissa was back for the summer, and Garvin was just visiting his sister. I don’t like their church b/c the people are quite cold. Or maybe tis just my first week there–like how I felt at OCAC. But OCAC is justifable considering that I didn’t know anyone there. People I knew at T3C (not well tho, mind you) just kinda ignored me and associated themselves w their own friends. I just kinda stood like a statue waiting for my Ben A. when he went to change. My theory is that people in TO are very cold and unfriendly as compared to people at Ottawa. Maybe that’s why I became good friends w/ Ben C. (cuz he’s from Ottawa!). I think Ottawa has already grown on me. I’m not a person to miss anybody or anything (even in first year, I never b//c homesick)–yet for some odd reason, I started thinking about Ottawa this weekend (but I briefly talked to J at work on Sat night, because Marc screened out my calls when I tried to return his). 😛
<a name="49"></a> After the banquet on Sat evening, I found out that <a href="http://www.brianfu.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Brian Fu</a> (T3C) is one of my childhood friends, Jeamie K.’scousin!! Small world. He’s going to be going to their wedding in ‘couver. Reason I found out is that he told me he went to BAC last week when he was there visiting his cousin Jeamie! :).
Couple of other things I wanted to mention:


<ul><li>sometimes worship songs are really weird; if you listen to “Father of Lights” w/o knowing the words, it almost sounds cultish b/c it could sound like: “Father of Lies”</li>


    

<li>At OCAC, there is some weird “formula” that Pastor Dan encourages the church attenders to learn, as a first timer, it may also seem “cultish”</li>


    

<li>mental note: never marry a lawyer. though s/he could defend you, s/he could also scam you in a divorce. or maybe just never get a divorce.</li>


    

<li>when incorporating a company, never use a name of the royal family. it’s illegal.</li>

<blockquote><a name="48"></a> Heheh. Before t’was Tetrinet; now in less than 1 game, Tim C. has gotten me hooked on Word Racer (like Boggle; in <a href="http://games.yahoo.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">games.yahoo.com</a>)! Heheh. Maybe my poor diction will improve by the end of the summer because of this (well, my Chinese slang has already been expanded by <i>those</i> guys :P). Dominic decided that he had to beat me at Boggle, er Word Racer (Tim can beat me any day!), so I ended up staying up til 4 AM last night, just playing and packing for my weekend in TO. Strangely enough, I’m not too tired today.I didn’t notice it til Ben A. called me to wish me a happy birthday and asked me if I was with any friends that were girls (my family asked me the same question later on in the evening as well :P) “celebrating” yesterday night, and I took a look around and said nope [not a surprise, but I was outnumbered 7 guys to 1 girl :P–ain’t I special or what? :)]. Lessee, what did we do?
La Musee de Victoria Memorial (of Nature–free admission on Thurs) avec Josh, Andy, et Marc. It’s an alright museum, but I think I still like Science World (Vancouver) better, and the Science and Technology Museum in HK. J was the first to call me (aside from my dad leaving a voice message :P) to wish me a happy birthday (yes, for those that didn’t know, don’t worry about it. I’m only 1 year older than before, which makes me to about 17 years old now :þ). I think Marc forgot about it til Andy found out from me talking to J, because in the morning, he sent me an e-mail that talked about birth months (and so I wondered if he even realised it).
So after Marc found out, P sent me a bday ecard as well :). And that was that.
Or so I thought.
For a very late dinner (thanks a lot, Jon! :P), we went ot Man’s Kitchen for food. Aaron, I found out, is another interesting character, he left a package for me with the restaurant people, and it turned out to be an Elmo colouring book –to keep me occupied in Marc’s class :P–reminds me of what Marie T. would give if I was back home [speaking of which, I didn’t hear a word from anyone back home, aside from my family–but I did hear from Carey W., who’s an alumni from CCF–can’t believe he remembered! =)]
Yeah, so as we were just finishing up our dinner (Andy paid for mine–thanks Andy), MJ comes along with a yummy DQ “lil devil” ice cream cake! [thanks MJ–his idea!] 🙂 MMM (i know i’m mildly lactose intolerant but i dont tend to care when it comes to ice cream :P). I haven’t had a DQ ice cream cake ‘specially for me since elementary school–they seemed to have changed their ingredients a bit (graham cookie crumbs in middle instead of bottom, and contains fudge now, but still good)! Wow, aren’t these guys cool or what? 🙂
Ah yes, I forgot to mention that Jon gave me a sunglass hut glasses care kit (even though I haven’t bought anything off him yet :P). how nice of him :).
Heheh, so I guess summer in Ottawa is worth it–though last year’s bday with Jeff K. and Dave P. w/ all-you-can-eat sushi was good too!. But yep, I was surprised (even though that thought did occur in my mind once or so–wondering if they had anything up their sleeves, but they seemed to act too normal).
Now for a packed weekend ahead in TO, wedding to go to–should be fun :). Prolly won’t update again til I get back from TO, so have a good weekend! 🙂</blockquote>

<blockquote>Another class of Business Law last night. This time, I was somewhat confused in the class; but it did cause me to wonder what the difference between a Inc. and a Enterprise is–and if my parents had to go through all that legal man-fan stuff; although there really was no shareholders or anything. Boy.
I did learn one thing however; the Arabic numberical system makes complete sense! That is: 0, 1, 2, 3, etc. came to be because each number corresponds to the number of angles in the number (if written properly) [ie. 0 has zero angles, 8 (calculator style) has 8, etc.]Yet, another surprise (boy I’m having a week full of surprises!). This time, tis a good surprise! Lori, from BAC/MCAC, called me last night just to chat. I was out at Local Heroes when she called [mmmm. the philly steak sub is actually filled w steak, unlike res food-blech x( ! and dom treated . . . thanks! :)] I called her back after I got home and we chatted til midnight. Tis funny, because I’ve never actually talked to her ‘cept at church. Maybe ‘cuz I associated her w the “older” crew of girls (childhood memories xþ). But we had a good chat nevertheless–catching up on church people, talking bout weddings/engagements, etc.
Woo-hoo! I actually went to bed a lil after 12 am last night. Too bad that I fell asleep in the middle of my prayers :(…I woke up at 430am and finished my Bible reading (tho’ i dont think i retained very much. think gotta work on that :\) and quickly went back to sleep :P.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Admist my semi-depressing and tiring day at work yesterday (mind was elsewhere), I managed to be quite productive. The e-mails and ICQ msgs that people sent were very encouraging, so it kept me going for most of the day. I’ve seen mass prayer requests, but I’ve never been involoved in the middle of one. To have people praying from the West Coast (BC) all the way to the East (ON) is really neat–especially since many of them don’t even know who my cousin is!I was soo impatient in waiting for any news, that I kept calling home, and waiting for 6 PM PST so that I could watch the live VTV broadcast online (my cousin was, and still is top story for certain news reports). There was nothing new cept for a different angle of investigation. This time, they interviewed her friends, Alanis (she came to church w Mavis a couple of times–she’s quite nice) as well. It’s quite ironic. Although much of the media reports are “spiced up” [to make otherwise boring or normal news juicy], I found that this time, I really had to rely on it and do my own investigation online (found things that my family didn’t even know). The media kept me up-to-date, more than my family did (and in greater detail).
My #1 resource was actually from a church friend, Jerms (BC). The wonders of ICQ! What a blessing! He kept me up-to-date because my sister called him like every 5 mins when she found out the Mavis was safe, but not home yet. And <i>no one</i> called me! Long distance rates on phones are “expensive” I suppose. They didn’t know the details and didn’t ever call me back (guess too late to have), so at work this morning, I read up on the details on every site I knew that had her story: CBC, BCTV, CKNW 980, News 1130. The most informative one was in the Vancouver Sun. I think that without the help of the media, Mavis would not even have known that her parents were frantic (yes, thank God she’s safe!–it was all a misunderstanding/miscommunication gap btwn parents and child). If you want to read the article on the Sun (note: in Ontario, the Sun is more tabloid, but in BC, the Province is actually the tabloid paper not the Sun), go to the http://www.vancouversun.com or contact me to get a direct link, but I don’t like what they wrote about her so I won’t post up the hyperlink here.
So, THANK YoU once again for those who prayed for my family, and became involved in what we were going through. Remember, God answers prayers! 🙂 Thank GOD! 🙂 T’was a scary experience nevertheless though.</blockquote>

She has been missing for more than 24 hours now and is even featured as the top story in many of the local news @ 6, and we are all <i>very</i> worried for her safety, and me–her spiritual safety as well. God answers prayers; I’m very confident in that. What the answer is, I don’t know yet. But I do believe that something good will ultimately come out of this. It’s soo surreal though. It’s almost as if I’m part of a TV show, looking at the news as if this can’t be happening to my very own family! Yet I know that I am not dreaming. That one of each parent’s worst nightmare is taking place. Each kid’s worst fear. . .Before this, Andy and I spent a day at Salem and Toys R’ Us. Because of my heels, I walked til my feet hurt. I did end up buying some Pass-It-On cards and a CD by Paul Baloche (Open the Eyes of My Heart). The CD is quite good. Reminds of songs from BAC. Why on earth would a Christian bookstore be called Salem though? Just disturbs me to know the history of witch-hunting in Salem. . .</blockquote>

<blockquote><a name="44"></a><a name="44"></a> As a proud (?) client of Clearnet, I get a chance to rent 2 DVDs/videos for free and 3 bags of free popcorn. Thank God that this rental was free–I thought Dogma would be a lot better. Well aside from a lack of a storyline, and overexcessive, unecessary violence (swearing I’m useta from J), it gave me something to think about:1. If Alanis Morrissette was God, I’d be really screwed over as a Christian.
2. If angels and demons are like these characters, I’d fear them over God!
3. Thank GOD, that being a Christian is not as messed up as Dogma sets it up to be as . . . 🙂
<a name="44"></a> MJ made it to church today. The AA class is apparently quite interesting. He’s quite a character. Another one that knows how to treat girls properly :). Hmm, no wonder he has a gf :P.
Yet another interesting person is J Moe. He hinted at us 3 times for us to stay after Dogma to eat pizza. It’s kinda funny that he wants us to stay b/c he rarely gets any company (according to him). Poor fella. And he wanted us to go w him to buy a Palm PDA ;). He ended up getting the [shiver] Palm m105, which I still have a hard time liking. So we stayed. Twas relaxing time tho and spending time getting to know him was kinda cool, and Roge too who fell asleep during the movie. Roge’s site is soo hilarious, esp the <i>Ni Hao!</i> wassup parody…:P</blockquote>

<blockquote>I am proud to be Chinese. MJ wonders whether I am really a CBC, an English major, and a girl. But I know better :). heheh. However, there are 2 things I am not proud of, even though I actively take part in the habit too:
1. CST: most, if not all, Chinese people seem to run on Chinese Standard Time–which varies from 15 to 45 minutes after the supposed time. So, if you are a punctual person, and you are Chinese, I really admire you.
2: Loitering. I have no idea if we got this from our parents or what, but everywhere I go, be it CCF or OCAC, we all loiter! Sometimes, I just want the crowd to stop loitering–yeah, I realise that it’s a social event or something, but you know, you can socialise when we’re eating too, ya know ;). The really annoying thing is that when I was younger, my parents would seem to loiter when I really was bored, but when I was having fun w friends, they would pull me away and tell me that it’s time to go. Ironic isn’t it? Maybe that’s why there is a bylaw in TO, land of FOBS, that the police has the right to break up a group of 10 ppl gathering in the streets. They don’t want us Chinese to loiter for 3 hours.</blockquote>

<blockquote>MMM. 2 BBQs in a row just makes my day! I think I ate a lot but I kinda feel bad b/c I didn’t really cook them myself–I ended up eating 1 hotdog bun and at least 6 chicken wings on Friday night. What was really cool, was that Viv and I were praying for God to hold off the weather, and he did! It didn’t <i>really</i> start to rain, until we got into the car (well, Marc got wet walking home, but oh well :P). J, Andy, and I went to the softball BBQ and I ended up having 1 hamburger and 1 hot dog (and for some reason, wasn’t too hungry for dinner either). We ended up playing on 2 playgrounds before we headed to the Coffeehouse @ OCAC.
Mental note: Never swing vigoursly on the swings immediately after eating. Nausea may follow.Would you imagine that playing on the playground would actually exhaust you at such a “mature” age. Whatever happened to playgrounds though? These things are all made of plastic these days. Wherever did the wooden forts, structures, and everything else go? And the slides! Plastic slides generate so much static and friction. In the good ol’ days, metal slides kept you going faster! So anyhow, J decides to do some pull-ups and chin-ups on the monkey bars (still working on the latter before I even attempt the former), and we end up trying our endurance in one chin-up position. I’m a sad sight. Both the boys managed a 55 second time, and I only accomplished 32 secs. I realise that my abs exhausted first before anything else. Ack, me too outta shape– I don’t even do daily push-up/sit-ups anymore either :(.
MJ came to the Coffeehouse, and kindly made me some fresh “3-eyed” fish (pickerel) from the polluted waters of the Ottawa River…I had one to test, and it tasted just fine :). Mmmm. . .
Met some new ppl today: Laetimer (spelling?!) Hu–Ben’s bro, Sam’s cousin; Crystal (who thought I was someone else, but I still don’t know who), Kandice/Victor, and Lon reminds me of Wayne P. from UWCCF. . .um. no further comment. 🙂</blockquote>

<blockquote>Woohoo, some of us got a chance to ride in Marcy’s (well, his family’s) new Accord 2001 EX-L. Dom felt dissed, but that’s really his fault for refusing to drive some people to Summerhayes Grill yesterday 😛 We all think that Roger N. bought the exact same car as they did. Haha :).
‘Twas Bri’s and Yo’s last day in Ottawa yesterday, so we went out to eat to bid them farewell (though the dinner was for Bri since Yo is a local boy). At the restaurant, I got a chance to meet some well-talked-about people such as Ho-Yin (spelling?) and Lisa. Ho-Yin somehow reminds me of Fred H. I won’t get into details.You know what? I think J should be a mall fair/carnival entrepeneur. I think that there is a positive correlation between one and getting enough stash to own a Prowler (as mentioned in a previous entry). That Prowler has been parked at the corner of Carlingwood Mall since the day the carnival/fair started. I think it will be gone by the time the fair is done. =).
Aside: Ben Allen and Dom played Tetrinet for their first time yesterday. Heheh. Dom is quite good tho, I must admit ;).</blockquote>

<blockquote>Saying grace before meals signifies a lot. I don’t know MJ very well, but just by seeing him in the action of giving thanks (w his own free will) somehow encourages me (there’s hope? :P) and wakes me up (“hello m, if he remembers to say grace, you should too!”). Firstly, I even have difficulty saying grace in front of people (well, non-Christians), and I even have said 3 sec prayers before or neglected it altogether :(. I also know that if I wasn’t a Christian, or maybe just a semi-Christian, I would not say grace and would probably not even bow my head or close my eyes, because it would be weird. Perhaps it’s easier to do so in the presence of Christian friends, but I really admire his respect for what we believe in. I hope he’ll get outta bed in time for church more often =þ . . .”I think it’s beginning to look like Christmas”–the leaves on the trees are starting to lose their green colour (red leaves now)! Yesterday’s thunderstorm was really cool. Flashes of lightning zigzagged across the sky–including a purple one– we felt the rumble too. Thankfully, it was sunny by the time we walked home.
Speaking of which, I’ve noticed lately that many residents in Ottawa are really well-off or just … hmm. I dunno the proper adjective. It’s not everyday that I walk in front of a Dodge Viper (yellow body, black racing stripes) as I cross the intersection. And just the other day, Josh (and I) saw his sister’s fav car (and his?) the Chrysler Prowler. I don’t see them a lot in Vancouver. They mostly have Z3s or Boxters or some other cars, and rarely any w stripes either. Okay, enough about cars. That’s what you get when a girl hangs around w guys. =P
Anime. Wow, haven’t seen anime or read any comics in awhile–especially not in Chinese. Maybe last time was HK TV cartoons in ’93/’98. So anyhow, GTO is quite an entertaining series, except he is a lil too HS for my tastes 😛 I think I understand why my mom wasn’t too pleased when I started reading Chinese anime books in Grade 8 or 9 (because Lao Fu Zhi was getting a lil too redundant [and easy–I wanted to learn to read more Chinese in the process] and I didn’t have access to Ding Dong (Doramoen) books either).
Thank God for unlimited evenings and weekends. J says that we talked for 2.5 hours on a 4 way conference call yesterday. 2.5 hrs?! That’s nuts. I haven’t talked that long to even a girl for awhile now, but I guess if you divide 150 mins into 3, then you get approximately 50 mins per person ! ‘Cept Marc wasn’t saying too much. And J was half gone for awhile (not that I blame them or anything since I was ranting again).</blockquote>

<span style="font-family: Century Gothic,Tahoma;"><span style="font-family: Century Gothic,Tahoma;"><a name="38"></a></span></span>


<blockquote>My French is absolutely awful. I don’t even know what Gatineau Park in Quebec is even called in proper French. Ah well :P. J thinks that he’s a curse, but it didn’t rain when we were there, so I don’t think that there is a postive correlation of the weather with J’s presence :). Gatineau was quite fun. Reminds me of the trails in BC. Ben Allen (since I can’t say Ben A. or Ben C. since they’re already taken, he’ll be Ben Allen) wandered to the cliffs across from the lake (the place where I originally wanted to go), and so 4 of us (Hilman, Andy, J, et moi) ventured into private property and I mustered courage (after taking some convincing) jumped across short distances of water. Rest of ’em stayed behind ‘cuz Yvonne had flip-flops on. I think the adventure was worth it b/c I finally got to see a <i>real</i> beaver swimming in the water :). We also got to climb cliffs. Not that they were very steep or anything, but it felt more “real” than wall/rock-climbing, and they had better foot/hand holds on the cliffs (no safety though). I hope the pictures turned out well =).Marc was supposed to meet up with us for dinner, but I guess the thunderstorm scared him away. I’d be ‘fraid too, especially if the wind was enough to push shopping carts into cars. Ah well, no biggie since it was only a Saturn :þ
Aside: I will become very “small air” soon I think . . . have you ever seen/read/heard about Peter Pan? He has no shadow! Don’tcha think that’s kinda cool–to walk around and ppl won’t be able to detect your presence from your shadow. I wanna be just like him. But I do want to grow up eventually :).</blockquote>

<span style="font-family: Century Gothic,Tahoma;"><span style="font-family: Century Gothic,Tahoma;"><a name="37"></a></span></span>


<blockquote>Yes, that’s right! For a good time, “dial a moment with Jesus Christ” @ 820-xxxx. I don’t exactly remember the entire phone number, but that is just soooo <i>wrong</i> especially at the Salvation Army Temple (which I pass by every day to and from work). It makes Christianity, or their church, seem like a cult or something.Marc was telling me how girls were ‘fraid of honey/bumblebees at CUAR. Well girls, you’d be pleased to hear that I literally saw a bumblebee be semi-instant roadkill the other day. Some bumblebee was whizzing around me and for some reason, it wandered into the street and suddenly, WHAM, a car hit it and it whipped to the cold and gray pavement. Shortly after, it tried to get up, but I’m assuming that my bus ran it over with it’s heavy wheels. Ouch.
Jammin’@ Yao’s (last time w him–*sniff-sniff* [*=his way of italicising/emphasis]–he’s going away already, and I just met him!) went for awhile. For some reason, I became <i>really</i> tired by midnight, so I kinda made everyone else leave by my exit =|. I think I’m tired b/c I keep sleeping so late these days. Anyhow, this jam session was kinda funny, because midway, the landlord knocks on the door and tells Miranda off (well, in a kinder way) for just buzzing anyone in, and shortly after he leaves, he returns again. This time, we thought we were being too noisy and we thought that Bri and Lon might’ve been in trouble because he took them outside and they were gone for at least 30 minutes. Meanwhile, as we continued to jam, we were starting to get worried, but when they returned, they had been drinking! Apparently, the landlord was drunk, and grabbed them to share his alcohol with him and his friends–kinda amusing really.
Un Tour en Francais. ACK. 45 minutes of non-stop French is crazy! I only understood like maybe 30% or less. Why were we so stupid to go w a French tour? Well, the English one was not offered. Josh graciously took me out to the Canadian Mint and the Parliament Buildings today (Marc had to stay home and study/do chores, else I’d drag him out too), and we later met up with Marc for dinner and worshipped at the Met. The Art Gallery was on strike, but I didn’t really want to go see it. I think God was having fun up there today. Whenever we went outside,it would pour (yeah, I got drenched) but whenever we’d be under shelter, it’d stopped :D. We also tried to visit Amy at the gelato place, but she wasn’t working–I still have yet to meet her face-to-face :\ (but the passionfruit gelato was good anyhow!).
Citywide worship was really cool. Except I felt really squished. I had barely enough standing room but it was okay :). They did songs that I mostly knew, and the recurring pattern was Vineyard (I think BAC has gotten past that 😛 because whenever I go back, I learn new songs). The good thing about singing with Vineyard songs is that I was able to close my eyes and just shut out any distractions. Like about 5 feet in front of me, this couple was practically making out during the whole night. I empathise with Sponge’s experience very well now. It was very distracting and uncomfortable for me, because it felt like I was a peeping Tom (or the girl version of Tom) without the intentions. I’m glad they’ve found each other, and if that’s how they worship God, that’s cool too . . . but it distracted me nevertheless . . .
We met up with everyone at McD’s afterwards, and I think I was a lil too hyper tonight. Ah well, that’s what I’m like at home, so too bad :).</blockquote>

<blockquote><a name="35"></a><a name="35"></a> It’s nice to be able to hang around Chinese (Cantonese) speaking people at last. Being away from UW (and TO), and in the city of French-speaking people, it takes some gettin’ useta :). But, I’m reminded of CC, where Nat expressed that she feels so outta place: she’s not really one or the other. Sometimes, I feel that way too. I’m not a “FOB”, but yet, in comparison to some “jok sing”s I know, I’m not that either. I enjoy conversing/reading/writing in Chinese (and learning more as I go), listening to music (and singing–even watching Chinese TV or attending worship) in Chinese–including the CCF theme song 😛 I love most Chinese food, if not all, including Bitter Melon [yum!] :), and my ways of thinking are often so “Chinese” :\. Sometimes, even my English has a slight tinge of a Chinese accent or something in it (unintentionally). Yet, I’m not really <i>that</i> Chinese b/c I definitely lack the slang/jargon, and my Chinese has this horrible English accent to it! 🙁 Anyhow, it’s almost refreshing to be able to communicate in my mother tongue (as horrible as it is) again :).Recently, I one of my friends was sharing that she observed that all her close friends are girls. I took a look at my own life again, and unsurprisingly, I discovered that most of my close friends are guys–even in Ottawa! Within high school, all my friends were girls, but my friends from church consisted mostly of guys. I think the reason has something to do with upsetting childhood memories with mean girls, and a lack of girls my age at church (and still holds true to this very day). Often it seems that I can relate better with guys for some odd reason (I think one hindering factor is shopping (as mentioned in my earlier entries). I avoid it unless I haveta go or there is a really, really, really good sale). Another is computer-related stuff (excluding hardware). My sister is the complete opposite of me. She really hates the computer, and anything to do with programming, but if you stick me in front of a computer that has Internet access and graphic applications and such, I’d be very content. I learned most of my HTML/javascript/networking/UNIX/etc. (pinging, netstat, netbus/trojans/ip spoofing/tracing) from guys–I don’t recall asking any girl . . . but I’m fine with it :).
<a name="35"></a> Renee even pointed out that we were the only 2 girls that saw <a href="http://www.shrek.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shrek</a> today. Actually, I didn’t notice–that’s how “normal” it is for me :). Yep, so that movie was very humorous =). I think it’s one of the “cleaner” (in terms of content) comedys as done by Eddie Murphy/Mike Meyer(s)?.
Hmm, yesterday night I went to my second Business Law class. Yes, that’s how “mo liu” I am. Did you know that you consume up to 12 lbs of insect particles a year and it’s perfectly legal for companies to not specify them in such products as peanut butter, KD, jam, and all sorts of other food items? Mmm. Yum. How nutritious. Did you know that abortion, in the early 19th century, was done intentionally, often at home? Pregnant woman hit the stomaches with the top part of chairs, or they wore really tight corsages (not the flower, the clothing item) to physically force a miscarriage. Graphical. Our class also discussed the equality of women and men, and managed to get onto the topic of topless women. Highly interesting topic, but I won’t get into that.
Aside: my computer works after this long –and many attempted to correct it by Marc, Dom, MJ, and Andy. Thanks guys! 🙂
Currently, I’m reading Ecclesiastes for my devotions. It’s actually quite an interesting book but I wouldn’t recommend it for depressed people (I like Chapter 3:1-8 and Chapter 12)–I especially like this verse in Chapter 12:12b (NIV):


<blockquote>“Of making many books there is no end, and much study wearies the body.”</blockquote>


Often verses like these, and this whole book, can be taken out of context. I’ll leave you to ponder on this verse =þ: “Also, if two lie down together, they will keep warm. But how can one keep warm alone?” (Ecclesiastes 4:11 NIV)</blockquote>

<blockquote><a name="34"></a><a name="34"></a> You are here. That was the theme of Campus Challenge 2001 –but it seemed to have shifted to many other phrases throughout CC, such as ‘are you here?’ or ‘why are you here?’ or ‘where are you?’ Because many people raved about how good Campus Challenge ever since my first year at UW, I have had high expectations (even though I didn’t want to) so it wasn’t as good as everyone said it was.Here are a few highlights or things that stood out during my weekend at CC:
<a name="34"></a><a name="34"></a>


<ul><li>Perth’s KFC’s has some really deformed (lopsided) forks</li>


    

<li>Because of my late sleeping schedule lately, I missed every jam session in the evening and zonked out at 1 am (they passed out after 430 am)</li>


    

<li>I am lactose intolerant and almost paid dearly for it (ice cream!), but I’m glad that God answered my prayer and took away any signs of a reaction by the time I went up as a panelist</li>


    

<li>Because I had adequate amount of sleep, I made it to the last prayer meeting (I skipped the previous two because I couldn’t wake up on time), <i>no one</i> from my small group was there!</li>


    

<li>I had trouble staying awake for almost all of the talks =\</li>


    

<li>The last session on self-reflection went into lunch so ppl’s stomach’s around me, and including mine, were growling. Not to mention that the section on “hope” wasn’t that hopeful at all; it was rather depressing</li>


    

<li>One of my friends said that I seemed to have matured in age since the end of April (maybe because I was thinking about the Sunday panel/forum),maybe I was in a group of people that I didn’t know, or maybe I was just too tired</li>


    

<li>Another friend commented that I dress differently these days. . .hmm strange</li>


</ul><a name="34"></a><a name="34"></a>I guess my mind was constantly on Sunday night in what I was going to say (since I don’t tend to enjoy sitting in front of large crowds and sharing) as a panelist, that I didn’t get a chance to truly appreciate or enjoy all of the programs up until that time. One of the reasons why I ended up sharing to 180 people (a huge crowd!!), is because Natalie (a UWCCF alumni) asked me to last minute 1.5 weeks before this event to, and she said that if I didn’t, then it would only be her and Stan. Well, imagine the pressure! I really was tempted to say “no” but the more I prayed about it, the less scared I was. So I tried my best. Because I’m a structured/organised person, I wrote everything out first and reviewed all the main points that I wanted to say in my head.
<a name="34"></a><a name="34"></a>The funny part is that when I got up there, my legs couldn’t hold still so I was actually shaking =P. But at the same time, it wasn’t as scary as I thought it’d be. Hearing my voice over the speakers didn’t seem distorted this time around (normally it does), and I usually hate using a microphone. However, maybe it was the way God planned it, but everyone sat toward the aisles so when I looked up, or was talking to the audience in a big auditorium, there was this big gap of empty seats, and that was rather comforting. 😛 People from my small group encouraged me by making funny faces, and I saw some others nodding at my points, indicating that they were actually agreeing/listening to what I had to say. I even managed to make some people laugh, which really helped me relax :).
<a name="34"></a><a name="34"></a>The most encouraging thing of all, was that afterwards, people came up to me and thanked me for sharing, even though I wasn’t expecting it; even ppl I didn’t even know! It was funny, because one guy, Ian, comes up to me and all of a sudden says, “You’re funny.” (many times afterwards), and I was like, “oh. okay. I didn’t know that, but thanks, and btw, what’s <i>your</i> name?” Nat was concerned that what we had to say may not have reached the people’s hearts, but from what they shared w me/what they learned, I definitely think God answered her/our prayers.
<a name="34"></a><a name="34"></a>Our small group had a good time. It’s too bad I missed most of their sharing because it went past 130 am, and I was asleep by then. But one passage that we thought was rather funny is found in 2 Kings 2:23-24 (NIV):

<blockquote>From there Elisha went up to Bethel. As he was walking along the road, some youths came out of the town and jeered at him. “Go on up, you baldhead!” they said. “Go on up, you baldhead!”
He turned around, looked at them and called down a curse on them in the name of the LORD. Then two bears came out of the woods and mauled forty-two of the youths.</blockquote>


<a name="34"></a><a name="34"></a>Hahah, we cracked up over that passage :P.
<a name="34"></a><a name="34"></a>One thing that I really learned at CC (I’ll save the best for last), or maybe truly realised at CC, is that during a bicultural symposium that I attended during my free-time, is that I really appreciate the CBCs who choose to adopt to the FOB style of dress, music, speech, culture, etc. I know that I would never be able to fully relate to “FOBs” because even though I really appreciate their unique style of everything, I cannot see myself dressed that way–ever (besides, a pair of gap-material ($20) pants for $80 is a lil steep for me). And well, my Chinese is definitely lacking. But who knows, I may change my mind after I go to HK this year. I know that when a CBC is often associated as being a “FOB” is often not a compliment, but I didn’t see the advantage til this weekend. By being able to relate to the “HK” or whatever “FOB” culture, and forming a circle of friends, who may be considered as true “FOBs”, it’s SOOO much easier to reach out to them then any CBC ever could. Even though I will continue to make fun of a certain someone, I’m keeping that in mind =).

<blockquote><a name="33"></a><a name="33"></a> Disadvantages of being computer literate: I’m not afraid of screwing up. However, when I do screw up, I’ve done it bad (ie. irreversible). Like not reading specific requirements and compatibility with certain hardware devices or installing something using via the unsmart way (w/o backing up or anything). I’ve had no problems w w2k at work or with my friend’s computer before, but I didn’t realise that my TV card would not be compatible with it. SIGH. Dom and MJ — yes, I finally met the infamous MJ–tried to fix my many problems (many times the machine died on us). In the process, we reformatted my computer, but this morning, Andy reminded me that I forgot to backup some irreproducable files: certain pics, and computer-drawn graphics. Ah oh well, maybe I’ll be able to draw better versions of the same thing again :). In the process of trying to fix everything, we think that my RAM might be defective as well. Great. Another faulty computer. It took us more than 3 hours, and my computer is still not fully functional. My sound card is still down, my TV card is inoperable, and yeah. Hopefully, we weren’t keeping the landlord/lady up (:\) b/c on certain occasions we laughed a lot and well, guys’ voices tend to carry.I also think I’m beginning to get useta sleeping past 2 AM and getting up at 7:30 AM in the morning. I didn’t go to bed ’til 3 AM last night, and today I’m better than I was on Tuesday morning (Monday night was my first late weeknight and it went downhill from there).
<a name="33"></a><a name="33"></a>Marc also told me that the company that sells the meat (er, whatever that stuff is) to McD’s is called 100% Beef, that’s why McD’s can say there burgers are made w 100% Beef. I don’t know if I believe him, but at the same time, that would be very smart of McD’s/the company if there are no legalistic issues involved with naming a company 100% Beef.
<a name="33"></a><a name="33"></a>Woohoo! I got my marks back. And I didn’t fail the most important course! =). PHEW. Actually, I don’t know how I did it. I think it was all God’s doing because I certainly did not know what I was doing in the exam (worth 50%), AND I was going into the final exam with a 30% in the course (this is the course where I failed my second midterm–47% and it was worth 30%). If I take my final mark and calculate what I got on my final to pull it up, I realise that I somehow managed to get an A+ on my final exam. I’m baffled because I’m certain that it’s impossible for me to get that (unless of course, he scaled the whole class, but I highly doubt it since some people in the course did very well to begin with). If it weren’t for my Science courses that are pulling my cumulative average down, I’d be even happier =). The funnier thing is that I forgot about it for a while, and then I had a “nightmare” the other night that I had to retake it in the summer because I failed, and then I started panicking and really eager to know how badly I did. Thank God that this dream was unlike the others; the ones that came true.
<a name="33"></a><a name="33"></a>CUAR. Hmm, the more that people talk about, the less stressful it sounds (and cheaper) as compared to CC. I think if I had to choose all over again, I’d probably pick CUAR. Dr. Miriam Charter is quite a dynamic speaker,and additionally, the place has rock/wall climbing facilities and kayaking (and probably canoeing too if they have kayaks. I don’t kayak, but I canoe even though I can’t swim at all). And for some reason, it feels like I won’t be seeing my OCAC friends for a <i>very</i> long time (maybe cuz I’ve seen them everyday since Sat)–or more like, they’ll be having fun w/o me and rubbing it in :Þ.
<a name="33"></a> Aside: Josh started a weblog. His reflections are more like Sponge’s. Worth reading. Actually, I wasn’t going to post Sponge’s link b/c of the language in his text, but I gotta be fair since there is some questionnable language in Josh’s too.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Yep, that’s right. I decided to learn for free yesterday. Surprisingly, learning w/o pressure is quite fun. Maybe the prof wasn’t boring–I dunno. I don’t think I ever want to major in law though (so there for those who take my last name as an reference to my future career, you can stop now :P), because I don’t like the idea of cases. However, the notion of getting paid from $300-$1000/hr is <i>very</i> appealing. Yeah, the shorten lecture was quite interesting partially of the topics that were raised and discussed: diamond rings, ppl who take advantage of you, and such. I think that the prof is the very first prof I know who addresses everyone as “ma’am” or “sir”–it’s usually the other way around. This class actually reminds me of the Criminology (/sociology) I took last year where the prof quoted life examples. I probably wouldn’t mind sitting in another class as strange as that may sound =). Besides, it gives me something to do right after work. And I got some stuff done for Campus Challenge–so I was actually productive in class!That’s not the main reason why I decided to bus to Carleton again though. This time around, Dom and Marc wanted to eat dinner at Local Heroes, the place that Kevin H. kept talking about when he was here on work term. The pizza is soo good there on Wednesdays–’tis 1/2 price! =) Peon had dinner already so she didn’t join us. I learned something else, I have been taking the LONG way to Carleton (on the bus)!!! On Monday, Josh told me to take the 85 to Hurdman, then take the 4 to Carleton. Well guess what I found out yesterday from Marc? I went in a circle! :P. He told me to take 85 to Bank and then either the 4 or 7 because the 4 takes you to Hurdman via Carleton and 7 takes you directly to Carleton. I didn’t take the longest way this time, but I still could’ve just gotten off at Bronson and caught the 4 instead of having the 4 backtrack many blocks to where the 85 was! 😀 Hehehe. Oh well, at least I semi-recognise certain surroundings now unlike some ppl I know (eg. a certain student from Carleton that I met not too long ago) :).
Long weekend ahead of me: tonight is jam session, and long weekend is Campus Challenge. =). Ppl here will be having fun at CUAR instead–rock climbing, kayaking, and whatever else! 😉</blockquote>

<blockquote>According to the map of Canada, yesterday was my first time that I’ve ventured that far east (in terms of province) in Canada. I walked to another province too! I never did that before. Hull, Quebec reminds me of HK and Hawaii at the same time! The traffic lights are horizontal (Hawaii), and the Museum of Civilization partially resembles the art gallery, or some auditorium in Tsim Sha Tsui in HK.The scenery in downtown, Ottawa (by the Ottawa River) is quite nice, especially when the sun is setting. I didn’t bring my camera again. Sigh. Dinner was at a British Pub (Earl of Sussex) . . . hmm, I now realise that non-Chinese food is quite expensive. We tried to visit the ever-mysterious Amy (Sailor Moon girl), but she wasn’t working at the gelato place that evening. Dom joined us (Andy, Marc, me) in Quebec and drove us back over to Byward Market. Andy left shortly after and Josh called, but my phone was dying, so he didn’t end up joining us cuz well, Dom just kinda hung up on him when he called him instead . . . 😐
Chilled at McD’s and Tim Horton’s . . . Sparks Street . . .now why does that street sound soooo strangely familiar?! I still don’t know. I’m thinking maybe NY or something. Hmm, yeah, Dom was kind enough to drive me home (the West) even though they live in the East. I guess it was a guy’s night out because all they talked about (but well, I was interested–so maybe not) was life in TO, and cell phones. 🙂</blockquote>

<blockquote>What a lovely day. The bus system is soooo inefficient in the city though. And some bus drivers are extrememly sarcastic. Like I asked one if the 174 goes by (or more specifically, do you know where the 174 is? I didn’t mean it literally obviously, I just meant to ask if it stopped at this stop–I didn’t know that it did b/c of the night stop rules), and he looks in his pocket and says, “Nope, not here!” like I was stupid or something. Okay. Maybe I am. Considering I don’t know Ottawa very well yet.Ah yeah, on the topic of lovely day. I was dying to do something outdoors and with people (getting stuck at home in front of my TV/computer is entertaining sure, but you can only have so much of that). So I decided to talk to Josh and Marc about it and Josh suggested we go to Hog’s Back. The first time Vivian said it, I thought she meant Horseback–and then she got into an argument w someone about how the playground at Britannia Bay is nicer and cooler. I should go to that one some day. So anyhow, after work, I bused to Carleton U. — my goodness, the buses are sooo slow; it took me 1 hour to get there! I met up w Josh (Marc decided to stay home in Orleans cuz he’s lazy ;P) and had dinner (McD’s) on a park bench beside the Rideau Canal gates. The scenery at Carleton is quite nice once you get out of the campus itself. Well, maybe with the exception of the dead floating squirrel in the canal. The dam kinda reminds me of Cleveland Dam in ‘couver (where Dark Angel was filmed in the 1st or 2nd episode and we happened to be on the set one the same day). McD’s is surprisingly good eating beside a canal. Vivan and Peon joined us not too long after and we headed to the dam part [haha. i just reread that…the “dam” part :P], and “climbed” some rocks.
Yaay! and we ended up at the mosquito infested beach (w sand!) and played on the kids playground =). So fun! That totally reminds me of home w Marie, Clarence, and Jasmine :P. I didn’t get any more bites (I have one from the day we went rock/wall climbing). The bus ride home was amusing because I accidentally stepped on the wrong bus (well, right one but going opposite directions). I didn’t realise it til the driver pulled out, then I thought why not ride the whole way since I would haveta wait at the stop for another half hour anyhow.
I got home to realise that my TV cable is up and running! woohoo! =) I have so many channels — never in my life have I had the luxury of cable TV! =) I get to watch TV, e-mail, and ICQ and do whatever computer graphics/web page stuff all at the same time in the same place!
Ottawa would be more fun if the public transit was more efficient and faster, but right now, I’m getting by. I have successfully occupied myself with things to do during the many days the week. 😉</blockquote>

<blockquote>My shoulders! My arms! Haha, I think I’m getting older. My body is not as agile as it used to be, and it was only last year when I rock/wall climbed last at SportsWorld in Kitchener (largest in Canada). I don’t know how we managed to do 3 hours! The indoor rock climbing place here was kinda ghet –funny really, cuz it was in a warehouse! =).So, we did end up going rock climbing afterall because Ben C had to leave early–all we did w Ben C was go downtown and get me a free COWS ice cream and him one too. Too bad that I had to make some others wait =\. But my ice cream was good!
Ah yes. Vietnamese food for lunch again. Smaller portions that Ben Thanh but cheaper. Dinner at St. Hubert’s–some French imitation of Swiss Chalet. It was w Vivian, Hilman, Andy, Josh, Roger, and myself. Marc went home because he was blessed to have a mother to spend Mother’s Day with.
Bused home. Found out that Roger lives near us and that Rudolph (Rudy from UWCCF) is his brother! Small, small world. Wow, I realised that buses can give you a scenic tour of Ottawa for no price. But I think it must’ve been Josh’s FOB/punk look and the fact that 5 chinese, along with 4 white people (3 we didn’t know) that filed into the rear of the bus, caused everyone to give us stares the whole ride–not to mention that we talked like typical chinese (really loudly), and my phone rang midway (yeah, Roge says I’m a FOB but he doesn’t drink bbltea, so I’m proud to be a FOB if nonFOBs don’t drink bbltea).
Ah a good shower, and now I’m headed to bed. I think God answered my prayers. I feel like I’ve made some friends here quite quickly =)–almost to a point where even though I don’t know them very well, it seems like I’ve known them almost forever. Gnite.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Sign #3 of a cold: slight irritation of the throat–>coughin spells.Busy day for me today. First it was Ed and Nat’s wedding–a couple I met in Ottawa who drove me to church twice. The wedding was simple, but different–different music, customs, tradition. Even the bride seemed to shy away from the groom’s kiss. =) The refreshments became my lunch. Brian decided to eat my share of the shrimp (and celery?), and we all had a ton of meatballs! Brian is soooo funny at times. His expressions and the way of doing things; one would almost say that he’s “cute” cuz he holds a spoon like a 5-year old =P [I wonder if Bri would ever get around to reading this].
The odd part is I finally met the Ben Hu that everyone makes fun of (the last name). I took a look at him and instantly wondered if he was related to Sam Hu (person I know from BAC). I was thinking to myself, hmm, well he kinda resembles him . . . so finally, when I got a chance to, I asked him if he was related to a Sam Hu. Not to mention that I have this habit of asking everyone if they know Person X with the same last name. He responded, “You mean my cousin, Sam?” I didn’t know if it was but I verified it w the SFU thing and all. . . =) That’s kinda neat how I have connections in Ottawa from BC! Another fellow whom I haven’t met by the name of James Kung knows almost everyone from Westside Calgary CAC that I know!
Spent the afternoon at the Ottawa Moutain Equipment Co-op store and felt really weird walking around in a outdoors store in a dress?! Then the rest of the afternoon at worship practice. Ah yeh, my second week involved as part of the fellowship worship. This week was a bit crazy. . .we kinda fell apart. Not to mention that most ppl on the team were newbies. =p ah well, a good learning experience I’m sure.
During this week, I learned to really appreciate my old housemate Shuk-ka, especially when it comes to doing the dishes (even if the majority of them were not hers). So if you, Shuk-ka, are reading this, THANK YOU, from the bottom of my heart! =)
Fellowship was interesting. The program that was planned tonight didn’t happen because the co-ordinator didn’t show up. But, we got to know each other anyhow through games that Vivian and Hilman initiated =). Ppl got bored after a while though, so we ended early and went to the ONLY place in Ottawa that has bubble tea. Tea was okay; better than Timeless in Waterloo, but atmosphere was a tad lacking. Probably because it’s not owned by students or a younger generation. Variety of bblteas were limited though.
Anyhow, that pretty much sums up my day. I think my life is starting to pick up from here =). No rock climbing tm though cuz Ben C. is in town.</blockquote>

There are still some kinks here and there that need to be adjusted, but other than that, I’m back in business . . .Oh yeah, remember how Ben, Sponge, and myself thought those brown things were beavers? Well, Euhan says that they’re groundhogs! He agrees that there are wild beavers, but just not on the side of the highway. =)
Ottawa has weird weather. I could see the rain pour down from the clouds today (from a distance), but at the same time, it didn’t rain on us ’til much later. It’s a weird visual effect.
Did I ever tell you my first impressions of some people I’ve met here?
Danny: He must be very important to have been introduced to me 4 times unintentionally now. He reminds me of Big Jon in a way. 🙂
Dominic: Matrix boy. Someone who is seemingly cold and unfriendly. =P
Marc: he’s cool, cuz he’s the first to call me “Em” here–it’s odd sometimes to hear your name being shortened because most ppl in Waterloo don’t; only my friends back home do 😛
Josh: FOB. (well, that’s what I thought. I thought wrong ;P).
Hilman and Vivan: Very friendly and outgoing; makes you feel welcomed :).
Brian/Lon: they look alike w their black glasses and columbia jacket; irony: they live in the same place.</blockquote>

<blockquote>This weekend has been the <i>highlight</i> of my time here in Ottawa thus far, and by the time I tell you what I did, you’d think it’s pretty pathetic too :P. But I woke up this morning with a sore throat (sign #2 that I am developing a cold). I think I might have gotten it from the contagious ppl at church (miranda, vivian, or josh).Friday: Jammed til 1 AM (woohoo, back to good ol’ student days) at Brian Y’s. Renee W., Nathan K, Andy S, Brian Y (of course), Euhan C, Tim C, Hilman S. were all there.
Saturday: Fellowship at Elijah.
There were only 20 or so present: Nathan, Dominic, Andy, Brian, Renee, Miranda, Vivian, Yvonne, Yvonne (visiting from Vancouver), Dorothy, Tim, Me, Stephanie (see Yvonne), Hilman, Josh, Ben (Chan), Marc, Danny, Dave (speaker), Emily, Peter, Chris, and Euhan.
Sunday: <i>Highlights of Ottawa</i>.
Church was fairly good. Drums and more cooler/contemporary songs were done during worship. :). Pastor Dan talked about spiritual gifts, which complemented our Sunday School classes very well (but again, using the 4 Es from Rick Warren’s Building a Purpose-Driven Ministry/Church).
Lunch at Vietnamese restaurant and spent afternoon at Dow’s Lake enjoying the pre-tulip fest tulips (it’s so not worth $22 but b/c it’s “pre”, it’s “free”!) and taking pics! Then, everyone was either tired or left to watch the Raptors game (who won!), but I didn’t want to be stuck at home again doing nothing on a sunny and mild weekend, so I decided to take Ben C’s advice and get to know Dominic and the crew better.
Even though I didn’t do too much, I had fun that night nevertheless. It felt like I was back at home–1 girl amongst a group of guy friends and it’s Chinglish =P. But at the same time, I felt like I was with Sponge/Simon’s crew. Dominic is quite a character. Him and Josh combined reminds me of Sponge (and Simon and whomever else they seem to have successfully corrupted)–actions/thoughts/speech. So, I guess there are ppl like Sponge/Simon afterall. 🙂 Good ol’ Sponge/Simon needs to wash their mouths/minds w soap. Dom’s crew is cool though–and full of courteousy (at the appropriate times)! :)–so Ben C. was right (D will talk to you once he gets to know you).
Went to the driving range (I just sat and watched w Josh. I hit 3 balls and wasn’t very good.). Dinner at Zak’s (hmm so Ben A. and Sponge didn’t pick a ghet place to eat afterall =Þ). Pool/arcades at Ottawa U. I played one game w another person who was about the same level as me (or else he was too nice that it seemed that way). Everyone I useta play against knew what they were doing so pool wasn’t fun before.
So yeah, that’s my weekend for you! Hope there will be more better ones to come–like rock-climbing next week! 🙂 Can’t wait!</blockquote>

Specs:
Pentium III, 700 mhz processor
128 MB RAM
20 G HD space (that’s the smallest HD they had!)
17″ colour monitor
DVD/CD-ROM/floppy drive(s)
Matrox G400 Video
Soundblaster 16 Sound card (and soon–TV tuner for my free cable :P)
Heeheh, and Yo roped me into serving for Elijah fellowship (OCAC) in doing worship (vocalist and possible pianist) for Saturday (my first day there).
Aside: please pronounce “pianist”, “pee-ahn-nist”, because the other version of it sounds a l’il um . . .strange.
It’ll be weird but hey, these ppl seem okay =)
Guess what? I received my very first wedding/banquet invitation this week! Thankfully I’m in Ontario this summer because I have a greater chance of making it to their wedding ceremony and reception =). I haven’t been to a weddding/banquet yet where any of my relatives are not present. Well, but maybe one of them will be there. My uncle’s brother could be officiating the wedding ceremony since he pastors MCAC (who’s also my first piano teacher and who took care of me when I was less than 3 years old I think)! The funny thing is they addressed it to not only me, and to my Surrey address. 😛
Housing. I sympathise with Sponge and whomever else with the whole housing situation. Wellesey Court has been trouble since Day 1.

<blockquote>Yuckie! I think I’m coming down with a cold. I feel like sneezing all the time (first signs of a cold). I think either Sponge, Andy, Peter, or Ben somehow gave it to me directly or indirectly.Peter is guy living downstairs (who’s not a loser as Sponge and Ben concluded from evidential evidence: snowboards, blades, has a motorcycle-like scooter, own place in basement :P). Ah yeah, and Steve (the landlord) is a mechanical engineer (not a carpenter as Sponge predicted).
Additionally, I don’t know what’s going on with my left jaw. The gap btwn the top and the bottow jaw hurts (mildy sore) when I open it all the way (like when I’m yawning). Oh well. Hopefully, it’ll get better by itself.</blockquote>

<blockquote><a name="23"></a> Few things I learned in the past couple of days:
1. Febreeze makes an excellent mosquito killer. Just squirt some on them and watch them die semi-instantly.
2. Clearnet (Telus) customer care centre lets you <i>choose</i> the type of music that you want to hear while you wait (to appease your emotions while they put you on hold for 15 mins or longer perhaps?!)
3. Cable TV isn’t all that great these days (as you can see, I am so bored that I watch cable TV). People accept vulgar language (eg. “illegits”, etc) as a part of everyday life (Simpsons, Friends, etc)!

<blockquote>I can’t believe I haven’t updated for almost a week! I guess that’s how dry this place is. . . there’s not much for me to blog–which is probably why I get close to 8 hrs of sleep each day or more. 😛 There are also no mountains to see when I look out my office window! 🙁 I understand why my youth pastor back at home loves mountains (she spent many years in Regina in seminary I think). Porkie said that God must’ve placed me here for a reason (instead of Leitch or in TO/Van), and one of the reasons is probably to develop my patience. I need a LOT of patience here (to be explained eventually but part of it is new place, people, and church). The weekend was more exciting though . . .Aside: my landlord offered me to take some of his green onions from their garden whenever I needed to use any (yum, I save myself 33 cents to a dollar per bunch and get fresh ones each time too =)!).
On Saturday afternoon, my uncle took me to visit their family. Azure (their white lab) is soooo big now! She’s two years old (which explains it b/c I was there for Winterlude in 1999). She reminds me of my stuffed Pound Puppy for some reason :P. The rest of the kids have grown too! Camile (spelling?) has really long hair and the boys love their game console (not sure which one they have). My uncle also showed me the area of the house that I would’ve lived in . . . but it’s too bad that they live so far away–but I would’ve definitely improved my Français!
Heheh, we had an interesting dinner meal–hot dog weiners and carrots w rice with wine (course the kids didn’t get any). Hmm. I’m beginning to think that ppl from the French culture can tolerate wine/alcohol fairly well. I tend to turn shades but it must’ve worn off after we finished watching <i>The gods must be crazy II</i>😛 That movie is bizarre.
OCAC (is that pronounced “oh-kak” if KWCAC is pronounced “quack”?!) reminds me of BAC. Yuck. Well, not yuck, but as many of you already know, I have something against Rick Warren and the whole Saddleback thing. I will retype that article my home church printed last year one day on the 8 characteristics of small churches (stereotypes more like). . .Kat L. told me that Melissa told her that Sponge and Ben were worried about me here. Isn’t that sweet? ;P . . .I found that Rev Hing Wong is a better speaker (more eye contact vs. reading sermon) than Pastor (Rev) Dan but at the same time, Pastor Dan is a very good Sunday School teacher, so it seems. He almost makes me forget that we’re doing the C.L.A.S.S series (BLECH.), where everything is fill-in-the-blank or one verse multi-translation scripture that may or may not be out-of-context. I think I like KWCAC’s Sunday School the best still. =) At the same time, the people at that church remind me of BAC–they seem like a church family. And the way they behave seem to reflect those at my church (BAC) who have been there for a very long time. I guess that may mean it would be hard to integrate, but at the same time, Ben C. has been telling me good things about these people for awhile now . . . except Dominic still has a bad impression on me. Too cool for me or something.
What I’m not useta is to sing the Doxology before the sermon. ‘Tis very strange indeed. The songs are somewhat refreshing though–to be able to sing songs of the early 90s. Sometimes I miss them because in CCF/KWCAC we recycle the same new songs over and over and over…again. However, I would like to sing some recent songs here and there, but I have a hunch that this church doesn’t have drums. Or do they? I haven’t seen one yet (my 3rd service there). Funny though, I’ve been seeing Romans 1:20 for three times or more this term already, isn’t that something? I also saw pictures of Leah Yim (? if that’s her last name) in the Jeremiah Fellowship pics. . .must be outdated or something, cuz she’s been in BAC for awhile now. I also thought I saw a look-alike of Auntie Joan F. Very Strange. 😛
I get there extremely early (ride arrangements), so I guess I have time to settle my heart first but that means I gotta wake up extra early too. I didn’t realise that my ride was going to come at 8:45 am (for 9:30 am service). I’m hoping to catch a ride off of Ben C. if he visits in May so I don’t haveta get up as early since he passes our area I think. . .=P
Anyhow, that’s my weekend. Ottawa. Yipes. I can’t wait ’til Canada Day. That’s what I’m looking forward to in Ottawa!</blockquote>

The small items are especially good–Chinaware cups and plates at 75 cents each, halogen light bulbs @ $2.50 (vs. Canadian Tires $5+), and certain wooden coffee tables for $10! Heeheh, and it’s relatively close too :). Anyhow, so far that’s my highlight of Ottawa :P.</blockquote>

<blockquote>When I said that Ottawa is dry, I don’t mean weatherwise. On contrary, the weather has been quite warm in the past 2 days–yesterday, it reached 26C! Dry–oh boy, I don’t think I can ever live here permanently. Chinatown is <b>only</b> one street long =(. It’s not very Chinesey either because many stores are Vietnamese or something else. See, after church, we couldn’t even find a Chinese restaurant that didn’t look ghet. We ended up going to this half-decent dim sum place to “yum cha”; the siu-mei is so cheap! No shrimp roe/eggs, or yellow wrap. . .Everything else closes sooo early! I have a free COWs ice cream card, but when we got to COWS, it was closed! The store is at the heart of downtown (marketplace), but it closes at 5 PM everyday–I work ’til 5 pm everyday! 🙁
Carleton University is sooo uuuggh. I am sooo grateful that I go to UW. Although Uw is nothing as nice in archetectrial (spelling =|) form/structure as SFU, Carleton can’t compare at all! The tunnels are good in that it connects to the whole campus but it looks, feels, and smells like a SUBWAY tunnel . . . The newest residences are the only thing that’s good–they look like hotels b/c they have sinks and such in their rooms, and they only haveta share the bathroom w/ the room next door.
There don’t seem to be very many theatres here for some odd reason–at least not in my area. I think my area is a lower income area or something…b/c I read in a magazine <i>Ottawa City</i> that Kanata and some other -ville has the highest income homes. Not surprising.
I actually saw WILD beavers here! They’re like Waterloo squirrels, they just reside on the side of the road–if there’s grass and all. I’ve never seen them in my life before (aside from in zoos). They’re kinda cute-shaped; like a groundhog almost. That’s what I thought they were at first. Sponge and Ben had their first beavertails here too. 🙂
My place is quite nice! Carpeted, large room w furniture, balcony, large and many windows around the house, screen windows, free cables and laundry, etc. Very comfortable and all for $300 inclusive 🙂</blockquote>

<blockquote><a name="19"></a> Wow, I haven’t been able to update this for awhile now :\. Having internet access again (even though it’s only accessible at work for now) is such a relief! I think I wouldn’t be able to survive without internet. At the same time though, I think I’m at the beginning stages of carpal tunnel syndrome because my right wrist hurts again. . .<a name="19"></a> I have much to say . . . let’s begin with my day-trip to Toronto.
Guess what?! The Sandylion Factory Outlet <i>actually</i> exists (well I know it did since my Youth Pastor back home bought many stickers from there years ago, but my friends didn’t believe me)!! I can’t believe that none of my Toronto friends knew about it until I personally found the HQ address (from the back of retail stickers) and looked at a map and “made” Ben A. drive there. I ended up buying a package of 35 squares @ 7 cents a square (that’s 21 cents for a regular sheet as opposed to retail price of $0.35-0.45 a square). The irony of it all, is that when we drove Eric C. (Ben’s housemate in Waterloo) back to the ‘loo, I brought it up and <i>he</i> actually knows about it!
Eric is the <b>last</b> guy on the planet that I would expect to know about <i>stickers</i>. Apparently, he has a drawer full of them at home. Why? Well, his mother and aunt both work there! I thought that “coincidence” was rather amusing.
Another “amusing coincidence”: Dr. Ho.
Who’s he? Actually, I’m not quite sure since I don’t have cable TV. But apparently, he is quite famous for doing infomercials. Anyhow, when he walked in with his not-that-young-kids, Ben said, isn’t that Dr. Ho? I was like, “Hmm, I donno but he looks familiar . . .” The teen behind us started rambling to his family, “That’s Dr. Ho!” Anyhow, it was quite funny, because I think Dr. Ho was in hearing distance but it doesn’t seem that anyone else at The Taste of Japan recognised him.
I finally managed to see what Pacific Mall and Market Place looks like inside. We accidentally stumbled by a dry-cleaning place, and after brief second a thought registered into my mind, “EEPS! That’s the place [of the  Pacific Mall mystery]!” So we “casually” walked back to look inside the store, but the white chair had NOTHING in it! Hmm. So I was thinking, maybe they removed it. BUT . . .
. . .2 stores down, there it was! Yipes! I don’t know if they actually change the clothes of the doll, because on the day I went, she was wearing a pink outfit–just like the picture. Ben was scared out of his wits even though it’s only based on a rumour; it was funny 🙂
Ottawa is dry.</blockquote>

<blockquote><a name="18"></a> A couple of my friends (guys of course) and I recently started e-mailing on the topic of purses. What we don’t understand is why girls like to carry purses, aside for the sake of accessorising their wardrobes. Practically speaking, purses are a hassle–they are small (hence, can’t carry much), burdensome (must stay on your shoulder or be watched like a hawk), and just not worth it (costs at least $30 for a nice purse that matches with only <i>one</i> outfit). MEC bags are more practical, but we don’t consider that a purse 🙂<a name="18"></a> <a target="_new" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shitake Mushroom!</a>
Heeeheee, that’s a good phrase to use 😛 For example, you drop a glass onto the floor and it shatters, perfect time to say “Augh, shitake mushroom!”. It’s even better than Dan T./Dylan L.’s “What the hay?!” Hehe, that mushroom phrase is actually taken from the movie <i>Spy Kids</i>. Yup, that’s actually quite a good movie, even though it stars two kids. Amazingly, we had the theatres to ourselves. That’s quite a different experience.
C-Factor. Sponge’s infamous theory. After seeing <i>Remember the Titans</i>, one has the idea of racism fresh in mind. Hence, when we were seated in the corner (away from the playoffs/big screen TV) of Morty’s (yet again even though there were only 3 of us and plenty of tables/seats to go around), was served pink-coloured ginger-ale, diluted cocktail, and iceless water, we were once again reminded that just perhaps, that place is racist, or nicely putting it, the “C(hinese)-Factor”. Last time, one waitress even told Clinton F. that he couldn’t sit at the end of the table, and made him squish at the end of the wall. She had an attitude with our orders and well, even though she was dressed “down”–that didn’t get her any points.
I think Sponge has a bad influence on me. The End.
PS. I almost forgot to tell you that Gabbie told me that a better nickname for him is Real Big (anagram). ‘Cept I don’t know how that relates to him . . . unless he’s a real big eater or something.
Hmm, anagram for “Gabbie” is “Big Abe” 😛</blockquote>

<blockquote>Another conversation with a friend today made me recall a previous discussion with some other people, possibly with Carey and the “POH” cell group.I’m curious as to the correlation of this interesting finding: whether this is more common with guys than girls, and whether having only sons is the factor.
The first time I heard this, I was very surprised. In my mind, I was thinking that these mature people are spoiled. But at the same time, I realise that they are not because they do not demand their mothers (usually) to do this, the parent just does it out of love.
So what is “this”? Well, I asked a friend of mine why he didn’t want to move out (aside from the cost factor), even though he would be working in downtown Toronto and would have to commute on the Go train every day. Somehow, we got onto “this” topic: his mother peels fruit for his entire family, and does the laundry <i>every</i>time–including folding and putting it away for them. Amazing dedication.
As you can tell, I have no luxury of that, which may be a good thing, since I have to learn basic survival skills, but at the same time, my consumption of fruits that must be peeled decreases 😛
Another relevant question: Do most parents, especially moms, spoil their kids more when they come home especially if they are study or work elsewhere? Hmmm . . .</blockquote>

The car alarms in our parking lot was set off by the thunder–reminds me of the thunderstorms back home, where the whole house shakes (maybe because it’s made of wood?) and car alarms are set off, and dogs bark like crazy.The saying goes, “April showers brings May flowers,” so I suppose Spring is here indeed (not to mention the warm weather)! 🙂</blockquote>

<blockquote>Actually, this entry has absolutely nothing to do w/ Star Trek, aside from the fact that my CS prof is overly obsessed with it. I just finished writing a CS 100 final in the PAC. Yuck. I hate that place; it’s so intimidating. But at least I get my own BIG desk :)! Big desks are hard to find in Arts.Anyhow (hmm I tend to say that often), this exam was <i>very</i> tricky. I think the class average was too high on the mditerm. Questions, if not read carefully, can easily throw one off. One example is this one:


<p align="center">What is false?
C. The Internet is another name for the World Wide Web
D. There are over 90 000 pages on Star Trek on the Internet</p>


I tried to reason two of them out because they could very well both be false.
C would probably be wrong (my most likely incorrect reasoning) because Internet refers to a network, but at the same time, you can “get on” the Internet without going on the www (in the URL) . . .
Although 90 000 or more pages on Star Trek may sound farfetched, there may be a 0.0001% chance that it could very well be true and I just didn’t know it (afterall, prof was big fan of Star Trek).
Another one asked what’s proper formatting if you want to emphasise a title in a document?
A. underline
C. bold or italicised
Well the correct answer for title headings is C and for titles of books, it could be A or just italicised. I picked C and justified it. Thankfully, there was a comment section (which I screwed up the question referencing for one :\ and now that I think of it, I may have even changed the correct answer on the bubble sheet, noticed my error, and changed it back to the <b>wrong</b> one! yipes!).
So I don’t know how well I did. Thanks to Matt M. who helped me solve a couple of practice questions last night. One showed up on the exam :). Also, word of advice to people who try to take any CS course: unless you allow your name to be shown in UWDir, your marks cannot be posted. I don’t know why my Arts courses seem to be okay in posting my marks. Which means, I have to e-mail my TA, who’s willing to try and get my mark, for my final mark after exams have ended. *High* (that’s Carey’s way of sighing in Chinese), so maa-fan. I think I will change my permissions in September cuz I’m taking CS 200 with Sponge in Fall term.
That’s why I like most Arts exams. I can make up everything and still get marks! Okay, I’ll stop ranting about my exam now. 😐

<blockquote>Hmm today was interesting. I’ve been having 10 hours of sleep a day or so lately and it feels really good 🙂 I went to a CS tutorial today and got our final projects back. Reflecting back, I think my TA has been one of the best TAs I have had as compared with my days in Science. He’ll be a very good highschool Math teacher (his aspiration) =). Anyhow, after realising that I could’ve used Notepad as one of the new applications as required our project I unconsciously said, “Doh! You made me learn a new thing!” in reference to learning Flash. He pointed out what I said and it actually sounds rather funny :).After the tutorial, I had yet another small honey jasmine with tapioca “bubble tea” from Sweet Dreams. I don’t think I can ever get sick of that flavour. . . people also think that I am bizarre for mixing flavours like pineapple with passionfruit. . . that tasted okay too but honey jasmine is the best so far! 😛
Oh yeah, I was talking to Ben C last night and what’s funny is that I pronounced “alias” wrong. I said “uh-lie-us” and then thought, “wait a minute, that doesn’t sound right” b/c i was just reading it from my head . . . he told me that in highschool, one of his classmates in Science read organism wrong. . . :\ oh boy.
PS. Anita thinks that guy from St. Cin’s is a Jason look-alike too 😛</blockquote>

That’s not exactly what I was planning to write, but considering I am listening to it in my CD player right now, it’s hard not to sing along :P.<a name="11"></a>Anyhow, if any of you know a Jason “Hut-Yee King” L., brother of <a href="mailto:angelic@home.com">Simon</a>, there’s a guy working at St. Cinnamon’s that resembles him for some odd reason.

I think Sponge or Simon should go see for themselves and let me know . . . maybe I’m just crazy (it’s one of the 2 asian guys working there; and the other one is obviously too big/tall for a “Jason”) :P.
That place is actually pretty good. Ben C. told me yesterday that there is a St. Cinnamon’s at the mall where I’ll be living close to in Ottawa–mmmm. The price, atmosphere, and quality is quite reasonable :). Very good competition with Williams at the UW plaza.</blockquote>

<blockquote><a name="9"></a> Hmm. I think I should make a new page for <a>archives</a> although I don’t keep a archive of my <a>announcements</a> . . .
Would you believe that I went shopping at Fairview Mall (Kitchener) again?! Anyhow this time, I was with only 1 friend so we didn’t stay for 5 hours (thank God!). I was reminded of this experience that I had the last time that I was there.Aside: Porkie commented the other day that I wasn’t a girl because I was surfing on the web trying to build my own car. I tried it w/ the Acura website one day at work and on that particular night in Twinkle, I was procrastinating once again so I decided to look at McClaren F1s and Dodge Vipers–$89 000 USD. Did you know that if you have physical disabilities and you live in the US, Dodge will take off $2500 (or so) from your car purchase? Hmm.
Back to my shopping story. I know that I look young (ie. 12 years old), and I don’t dress sophisticately with class, BUT I still expect a certain level of respect. Because I was dressed very grungely the other day, I went into Laura Petites to look for some interview clothes. I appreciated the fact that I wasn’t watched like a hawk, but at the same time, the saleswoman didn’t have to look at me from head to toe like I’m being checked out or something. Anyhow, yeah, a word of advice for those who are shopping for clothes with class: dress accordingly.</blockquote>

<blockquote>I never truly realised what a bad company Kinko’s is until one of my group members pointed it out. Aside from being over-priced in charging for its services, they work only as required. What I mean is that the guy doing the photocopying will not come over to help the cashier even when there is no one taking cash, and like 6 people in line!
Would you also believe that they charge $99 CDN for AN oversize colour copy? And a per minute charge of computer usage?! They also deceive you. We got a printing quote for less than $0.75 a booklet, but what they neglected to tell us (intentionally I’m sure) is that they did <i>not</i> quote the labour costs, which eventually worked out to over$1.30 per booklet. Sponge got peeved at them today too. At this time of the year, Kinko’s isn’t that busy. However, these people don’t even have a relatively small print job done yet even after at least 18 hours!Note: Pastor Tim (Wai)’s sister is called Sponge. Jason Chan is also Sponge. This Sponge is in reference to Jason.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Is there a correlation between procrastination and performance?Most people would say yes. I would most likely say yes unless I knew what I was doing. Unfortunately I <i>thought</i> I knew what I was doing. Remember that weekend where I said I procrastinated by spending time with fellow brothers and sisters just getting to know them? Well, somehow, the midterm that I thought I did okay on came back to me and gave me such a sorry disappointment. Having gotten a A- in my last midterm (same course), and seeing this barely passing mark (D/E?) shocked me. I realised that I missed some important details in what the prof taught, and that each question was worth a lot more than the previous midterm. Each error constituted to -3%!
Since I haven’t seen such low marks since my science days, I was very worried and depressed for most of the day, not to mention that I’m taking <i>another</i> course by the same prof in the fall as well (it was either him or a course w another prof that I would have had for 3 terms in a row). Being a human being, I considered blaming everything on God or on CCF–on my time spent on committee work (or just attending meetings), or thinking, “See, this is what you get when people forbid you to talk about your academic needs in prayer meetings”–even considering “bribing” God: “Look, if you had promised God again that you’d be willing to serve on commitee next year, you’d get your marks…go on, make another commitment!”–even though I fully knew that God’s grace in one term does not necessarily mean the same for the next.
Anyhow, I didn’t blame God or anyone else, even though I was sooo tempted to but I knew that I wouldn’t get anywhere for doing that. Instead, I blamed myself. “Coincidentally”, it seems that I somehow “forgot” to write this particular midterm down as my own prayer item and it was the one I did worst on. The rest I wrote down and God met my mimimal expectations (why does that <i>always</i> seem to happen?! every time I pray, I pray for the minimal, and yet, often I wonder if I prayed for more, would I then receive more? I have such l’il faith). I’m thinking to myself that I would be merely superstitious if I correlated writing my prayer items down to having answered prayers. However, maybe it’s the way for me to grow in faith, to remember to give my worries and things that are important to me to God and to visual see His intervention?
I dunno. Hopefully, I’ll still be able to maintain my average and to well, stop procrastinating! 🙂
Note. Funny thing is that I learn a lot from this course, and I find it very interesting, even though I’m doing so terribly in it 🙁</blockquote>

<blockquote>More shopping experiences.Why I don’t like shopping. Reason #189
Whenever I <i>need</i> clothes for a specific occasion, I can <i>never</i> find anything! Everything is either not in stock, the wrong season for my liking (eg. purples and pinks), or it doesn’t even fit me!
I even had to go to <i>CAMBRIDGE</i> of ALL places to see if they had my size. Nope. So what happens?
Lesson #597: Sewing 102. I say 102 because I’ve taken Home Ec 8 and I got 96% in the sewing portion of the course. However, when it comes to the real world, the stitching they teach you is not practical at all! Hemming up 3 inches of pants isn’t my idea of a “perfect fit”–not to mention that the waist still has room for a potbelly 😛
On the other hand, life is more than just shopping.
If you were driving eastbound on the 401, and you see the person suddenly brake in front of you, what would you do?
Well, let’s assume that you would brake too. Imagine that the car in front of you suddenly stopped because s/he wanted to see want the commotion of the wesbound traffic accident, and your 15 year old car could not respond in time. You tail swerves and hits the guardrail. You are knocked unconscious.
When you come to, the Jaws of Life saves you, and you see your car totalled. You have minor injuries and you require your arm to be in a tight sling for 2 weeks. What you don’t know is that during the time you were knocked unconscious, a truck carrying a lot of stuff smashes into you. Emergency crew on the other side of the highway sees the whole accident. They assume you are dead.
Now, substitute “you” in the above story with one of my friends (well, I just met her, but I’ll consider her a friend :P).
Life is hard. But God is good. I thank the Lord for sending guardian angels to watch over her. She thinks that it’s has something to do with her mother being in church that day. In time, I hope that she realises this God of love–one that can save her from ultimate death.</blockquote>

<blockquote>I would have never guessed that shopping with a bunch of girls would be such a humbling experience.I’m such a “boy”! (I should be in Engineering/CS).
First, let me tell you that shopping for 5 hours with 5 other girls is not my idea of “fun”. Maybe because on Boxing Day one year, my sister made us (dad/brother/me) wait outside for her for 40 mins, just so she could line up, try some clothes on, and buy some clothes. I did not like shopping with her since then.
I felt like I was in <i>Clueless</i>, sweeping the Fairview Mall in Kitchener. I don’t know how we managed to stay til closing beginning at around 6 pm. However, these girls <i>really</i> knew how to shop; they knew what looked good with what and what was a good bargain. By the end, we all ended up holding onto at least one shopping bag (except Schmindy). I felt so inexperienced while shopping with them, but at least, it did me some good, because w/o Schmindy’s help, I wouldn’t have ended up buying 2 collared shirts (shamefully admitting that these two are the first two collared shirts/blouses in my wardrobe since Band 9). I needed to look for interview clothes, and I’m grateful that I had “professional” opinion along my side 😛 At home, if I ever needed clothes for occasions that I don’t have, my sister’s wardrobe is easily accessible 🙂
Please note: I <i>do</i> have clothes. They are just clothes I like to wear: comfie and well, me! 🙂 (not appropriate for all occasions).</blockquote>

<blockquote>My eventful Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday.Sunday and Monday was spent procrastinating even though I technically have an essay due on Friday, and had a midterm Tuesday. I felt it was actually worth it though. Lunch was at Ben Thanh’s (pho) with Pork, Jon, Daisy, and Irene. Afterwards, somehow Pork an J ended up coming over and we discussed the most interesting topics. I actually felt like I was back at home with my friends. I actually learned something.
I realised that it’s so true that girls “rate” other girls and yet, guys don’t seem to do it as much. I could probably tell you which girl is “good-looking” in the world’s point of view, but I tend to get stuck on the guys 😛 (no, I’m not gay, but thanks for your concern). . . Anyhow, that’s another topic for another time.
Cell group on Monday was interesting. I procrastinated by doing something productive and sight-reading in piano for cell group. PTL, 20 people showed up (which made me even more scared when it came to playing songs I have never seen nor heard in my life before).
The funny part was that a guy came in a lil before we finished and when I opened the door, I didn’t ask who he was, because he just sauntered in with a chair and apologised for being late. I didn’t know him but I guessed that one of the other cell group members did. Upon sitting down, he went on to explain that he was late because he had to drive someone to the hospital. Bosco proceeded to ask him if his friend was alright, and he said yes. Okay. Bosco picks up where he left off and mentions “Yeh-Soh” (Jesus), the newcomer looks around and sheepishly says that he’s in the wrong meeting room. I felt so bad because after he left, the whole room erupted in laughter. Everyone assumed he knew someone else and well, he probably heard us laughing.
Tuesday. Hmm. Sometimes, I wish that life was a Hollywood film, like <i>Sliding Doors</i> (even though I didn’t particuarly enjoy the movie on the plane). That way, my non-sensible side would be able to take a glimpse at what would happen in a different situation that is based on a different choice I make. Anyhow, not that I wanted to actually do this, but I was tempted to see what this stranger would say if I said, “Sure, what time?”
Lemme back up a bit.
Tuesday morning, Shuk-ka and I were walking to class (late as usual), and as we approached E2, a van stopped to let us cross. Normally, I would gesture a thanks, but I didn’t that morning. So, as we were crossing, the van slows down, and this guy hesitantly looks out the window and says, “hey!” Shuk-ka and I look back, but I think I must’ve looked back first because he said something along the lines of (in a serious manner), “You want to go out with me tonight?”
I’m not sure who he was directing that question to considering that we were the only girls around, and I’m sure his friend and him had a good laugh afterwards, but I answered for the both of us and politely replied, “That’s okay, thanks,” and walked off. I don’t think that’s a good way of rejecting someone but I don’t really put much thought in rejecting strangers 🙂
Yes, I’m aware people do that in Vancouver and Toronto, because my friend has been approached in Vancouver a number of times, even during a fund-raiser car wash . . . anyhow, these guys must’ve been on drunk, desperate, a rapist, on a dare, or trying to make fun of random people. Nevertheless, I thought it was quite amusing, especially if in the next person he asked said yes.</blockquote>

<a name="3"></a>In a building where Mathies (and CS students) reside, I would expect them to be more intelligent than this, so I won’t blame them for what happened today . By default, we will blame it on the Economics 102 class. Rumor has it that because of midterms, namely Econ 102, some idiot decides to pull the fire alarm, evacuating their class, and thus, the rest of the building. I’m in Twinkle2 trying to ignore whatever the buzz is all about until curiousity gets to me and I see everyone, but these computer geeks in Twinkle, evacuate.
<a name="3"></a> I debate whether to believe it as a hoax or to leave. The sensible side of me tells me to leave–better to wait then to die trapped in a Math building. I proceed outside . . . hmm . . . wait, I actually smell smoke!! 🙂
<a name="3"></a> Hehe, merely cigarette smoke :P. I look around for familiar faces and spot Wesley S., Mike C., Jordan T. to name a few. Finally, we re-enter the building and most of the people in Twinkle2 are still there! Okay. I feel stupid now.
<a name="3"></a> What I don’t understand is the maturity level of those frosh (assumed for 100 level course of Macro-Economics). I had a similar problem in the PAC in my first year twice, and the amusing thing is that the profs let us keep writing afterwards, after a million people discussed the answers in a foreign language.

<blockquote>In the age of technology, you would think that everyone would be in appreciation of the quick speed and the advancement in hardware and software development. I have learned a few things.
Notebooks.
What I don’t understand is why there are two terms for a portable computer: laptop vs. notebook. Personally, I think that “notebook” sounds more sophisticated. Anyhow, even though notebooks may be increasingly attractive for consumers as the weight and value decreases while increasing in (HD) size and space, keep in mind that desktops still are more versatile than notebooks.
If you are considering on buying a notebook, here’s object lesson #2.
I bought an used Compaq notebook for $1800 in Winter 1998. I am never going to buy anything used again, especially not something that is technology reliant. This notebook was one of the better ones from 1996 and it came with a modem/ethernet card, 120 mhz pentium processor with 1.2 GB of HD space and 48 MB of RAM. During the same term, my screen cracked and thus, became useless as the warranty would not provide coverage. The theory behind the reason was that the weather change from indoors to outdoors was too great, that the cold air eventually caused the LCD screen to break. Fortunately, a monitor fixed that problem.
Fast forward to the present. I have a monitor, a keyboard, a mouse, and a printer, which are all externally connected to my notebook. I cannot run my PDA Desktop software and synch my PDA because all my ports are occupied. In the past 2 months, I have ran into problems trying to find HD space for various software programs I’m interested in installing. I cannot upgrade my technical skills, because my HD won’t allow me to install both Macromedia Flash and Fireworks, because they are 40 MB and 80 MB respectively, and I have only 135 MB of space left. I am on dial-up (which is “free” vs. cable modem/DSL for $40/mth) and do not want to download a 20 MB zipfile. I think it’s time for me to really consider purchasing a desktop (HD since I have everything else).
Notebooks? Yes, they’re good for travel and convenience, but if you are investing in a computer system for long term use, be sure to weigh the pros and cons.</blockquote>

<blockquote>If you think that it’d be cool to be up-to-date with every high-tech toy on the market, then consider this object lesson.
If you don’t want to have a restful sleep, here is what you do. First you buy every communication device possible: mobile phone, PDA, pager. Next, make sure the pager is running low on batteries, and the mobile is set to “loud” mode and to receive i-fido text messages at 8:30 in the morning. Thirdly, the scheduled appointment on your PDA must be set so that the alarm is turned on to ring every 5 hours and the time set is for all day. Next, go to bed at 230 AM and be prepared to wake up at 1030 AM.
Or should I say be woken up at all sorts of odd hours in the night? First, my PDA alarm goes off at 3 AM which I turn off. At 830 AM, my mobile beeps to notify me of the weather forecast of the day. Somewhere in between 3 AM and sunrise, my pager sounds an alarm to alert me that the batteries are low. At 1030 AM, my REAL alarm clock finally tells me to wake up.
Due to cost-benefit reasons, I couldn’t throw my PDA across the room to tell it to let me have some peace, and my pager/mobile was too far away to reach. Somehow, my 8 hours of undisturbed sleep became an electronic nightmare. Thus, one of the many disadvantages of having so many high-tech toys . . . but there are many benefits too . . . just in case you wanted to get one 🙂</blockquote>
