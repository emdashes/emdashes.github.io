					<description><![CDATA[I enjoyed the experience.  It was different than what I had in mind as an &#039;orchestra&#039;, but it was done well nevertheless.
But I must say those lights were really blinding at times...
And Christopher Tin&#039;s Baba Yetu could&#039;ve been sung better.  But I keep in mind that they only had a youth choir.
Did you know that song is actually a modification of The Lord&#039;s Prayer in Swahili?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The Seattle show was full of electricity in the air. I agree with the electric guitar, but overall the presentation was too loud. The combination of the music with the visuals was great though. Maybe you&#039;re right about toning down the showiness of it all and let the music that we all know and love speak for itself.
Did you guys have the Space Invaders and Guitar Hero competititions too?]]></description>
