					<description><![CDATA[oh my goodness.  this sushi looks SOO good!  i haven&#039;t had sushi in a while - it&#039;s expensive, and when available around here (as it infrequently is), it&#039;s usually rather poor quality. your photos make my mouth water, hehe.
p.s. - wow, they had trouble with your first name?  :(  i imagine they&#039;d probably be even more confused with mine...]]></description>
