					<description><![CDATA[In response to your comment on my blog, I feel sorry for the princess. She has to kiss a toad.  :p
As for being lost...perhaps the first step is being lost ourselves.  I too wonder what do the lost look like and how do the lost live.  I once was lost.  Now going back to the &#039;lost&#039; I feel like a fish on land.
Cheers,
Cliff]]></description>
