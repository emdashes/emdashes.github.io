					<description><![CDATA[I noticed a number of the same distinctive things at my cousin&#039;s Chinese Catholic wedding in Hong Kong last year.
- We still had a full opening procession to tape-recorded music
- The priest wore cool red and gold vestments, instead of white and gold
- the tea ceremony was quite early
- the cake was eaten before the dinner
- The dinner was late and ended abruptly]]></description>
