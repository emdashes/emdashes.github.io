					<description><![CDATA[@L - I actually don&#039;t recall that, but still one would think they are more mature and classier than that!
@jopoo: we didn&#039;t dare touch the strays; who knew what rabies they had...so joseph was fine (though now that you mention it...he either was sick or had the allergies during the portion of the trip - i was afraid i&#039;d catch it too)
@mur ~ it&#039;s not &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; similar, but there are similarities :) (and it is closer and cheaper to travel!)]]></description>
