					<description><![CDATA[The sun worked SUPER well on our Grovia cotton cloth diaper inserts when we used to use cloth diapers for our kids. The sun bleached the stains out and the diapers also smelled fresher afterwards. Some inserts and AIO diapers can&#039;t be sun-dried though because it wears on the elastics too much. We were pretty dedicated with cloth diapering our firstborn (even traveled to Hawai&#039;i and Toronto with them!), became more lax with our second (supplemented with Honest, Bambo Nature, and Earth&#039;s Best disposables + Grovia compostable inserts), and haven&#039;t used them at all with our third so far. Too much laundry management already at this point, and my diaper bag is full without the giant cloth diapers. ;-)]]></description>
