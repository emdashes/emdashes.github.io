					<description><![CDATA[I agree that we need to be careful and think that relying solely on alternate “medicine” practices isn’t a good idea either. However, I wouldn’t discount them completely, instead, perhaps would consider them as a supplement to a traditional, western medical doctor. It’s a shame that in my experience, the family doctors and specialists I have seen often treat the symptoms instead of the root cause and lack a holistic approach in patient care.
While they might lack scientific evidence and effectiveness (it’s hard to quantify if each person reacts differently to natural herbs, etc. – just ask a homeopath), I know certain Chinese medicine practices including acupressure points for headaches, nausea and ginger tea when I feel like sneezing and nausea usually works for me – anecdotal qualifications I guess. For chronic issues like food sensitivities, psoriasis, eczema, or even gallstones, I would consider alternate recommendation if things like diet changes can prevent problems from appearing (or the surgical removal of say, the gallbladder, without guaranteeing that that’s causing the pain attacks anyway. Sure, one might be able to function without one, but I trust that God gave us a gallbladder for a reason).
It’s funny, because it sounds like I’m on this Chinese medicine boat, even though I knock a lot of the Chinese confinement beliefs, but I’m more about “if it makes sense”, I might consider trying it out. Thanks for the links!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Ok, I know everyone is entitled to try what they want, but I am very wary of CMDs and NDs. Their work is simply not evidence-based. Please be careful!
Some reading for you...

If you&#039;re interested in the latest research I can retrieve some studies for you. :P]]></description>
