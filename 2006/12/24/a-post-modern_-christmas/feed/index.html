					<description><![CDATA[I was one of the people guarding the doors so I felt like I was a bouncer for a night club or something... Hehehee.. I agree. I went to the last show and the veils were quite annoying as I couldn&#039;t read what the PowerPoint Presentation were trying to say. And the Powerpoint presentation were so wordy... if only they&#039;ve taken the class, no more than 6 lines, 6 words per line MAX. :P]]></description>
