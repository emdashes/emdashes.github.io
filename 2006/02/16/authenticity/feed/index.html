					<description><![CDATA[I saw in CBC National a report about Dr. Chandra, a renowned nutrition scientist, who falsified data and published in scientific journals results in favour of his corporate clients and also his own patented multivitamin products. Here is the link:
Is it surprising for people to be cynical about everything these days?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Bodybuilding magazines are like that.  They are full of articles outlining the routines of top bodybuilders.  However, they also push supplements in the articles, and if you read the fine-print  in the first few pages, you find that the company that publishes the magazine is the same company that makes the supplements.  The supplement company funds the bodybuilders, then uses them to sell the supplements in a magazine, which you&#039;ve still paid $5 to buy.  Really, it&#039;s just 100 pages of supplement ads.
Once I realized that (took me far longer to do so than it should have, I&#039;m embarrased to say), my opinion of most exercise magazines dropped to zero, and I haven&#039;t bought one since.
