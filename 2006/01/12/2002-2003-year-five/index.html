		<p>				 The (CCF) people who‚Äôve been a part of my life:
</p>



<p>
<i>Frosh Year</i>
</p>



<ul><li><b>Pastor Tim</b>: I met Pastor Tim once in 1997 at some Missions Conference
    held by all CAC‚Äôs in Canada. He knew my youth pastor from BAC from way back.
    I remember we were playing some game and he said, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre playing @$$hole!‚Äù
    and I thought to myself, ‚ÄúWhat kind of pastor swears?!‚Äù Not to mention he
    said to me, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not going to make it into Optometry.‚Äù (ouch). He definitely
    isn‚Äôt like any other pastor I‚Äôve ever known (in a good sense)! My pastor at
    BAC somehow told me that KWCAC had some free shuttle service from the airport
    (which doesn‚Äôt exist), yet when I e-mailed Pastor Tim, he offered to pick
    me up from Pearson :). To this very day, I‚Äôm very thankful for him (even though
    I proved his statement right about Op) and has over the years, showed me that
    pastors are just normal people (instead of people that you only see up on
    the pulpit on Sundays).

<p>
  </p>

</li>



<li><b>Dylan Lum and Amy Tung</b>: In Grade 12, those two kept in contact with
    me by answering my many questions through e-mail about CCF. Ha, and to think
    that I thought CCF was going to be in Cantonese (hence the name, <i>Chinese</i>
    Christian Fellowship)..Dill is the least likely Chinese =). It occured to
    me once that perhaps Dill and Amy were going out then because Dill talked
    about his girlfriend (back then) and well, Amy seemed to be quite involved.
    I didn‚Äôt realise they were part of the same committee ;). From our first discussions
    in my frosh year about our differing views on disciplining children and homosexuals
    serving in the church, I‚Äôve come to see how much he‚Äôs grown in God by the
    time he graduated.</li>



<p>
  </p>



<li><b>Alan Liu</b>: ‚ÄúHi! I‚Äôm Alan!‚Äù I distinctly remember him as being one
    of the first ones to introduce himself to me during the first CCF Praise and
    Worship night at KWCAC. I also remember him saying that he was from Missisauga,
    but no, didn‚Äôt attend Pastor Isaac‚Äôs church (MCAC) but rather, MCBC. Through
    him, I met others like Will Wong and Yee-Min Cha.</li>



<p>
  </p>



<li><b>Sandra Cheng</b>: She was the leader of my worship team (who I think
    also had Daisy and some others). Not only was she passionate for God, she
    truly had the gift of caring (and still does to this very day). I remember
    that even though she was on her work term, she would call me to see how I
    was doing as a frosh.</li>



<p>
  </p>



<li><b>Ken Chung</b>: During one Sunday after a CFC service, he invited me over
    to Shakespeare and made some noodles for lunch, while watching Veggie Tales
    (Madame Blueberry)! I didn‚Äôt know him well then, but soon got a chance to
    just hang out w him and Andrew Ma in V1. I ended up watching Martial Law and
    Buffy üòê every week during dinner with him and Eric Fung (the fruitopia label
    collector :P).</li>



<p>
  </p>



<li><b>Karen Leung</b>: Although she was not a UWCCF goer (she was a Guelpher),
    Karen came to visit UWCCF many times during my first year. I was struck by
    her hospitality and kindness in outreaching to people she didn‚Äôt know. During
    one thanksgiving weekend, she even invited me over to her place (in Guelph)
    for some Thanksgiving dinner‚Ä¶.I had to decline because it was too far away
    (but PT invited us!).</li>



<p>
  </p>



<li><b>Larry Kim</b>: Although a quiet-to-himself sort, he didn‚Äôt hesitate to
    offer to walk me, a stranger, home to res after seeing me at the old twinkle
    lab (surrounding the MC Red Room) to check my e-mail and to contact my friends
    back home after CCF one night, even though he lived in the complete opposite
    direction. From his actions, I soon realised that many brothers made sure
    that their sisters were walked home safely back then.</li>



<p>
  </p>



<li><b>Alan Wong, Andrew Ma, and Jason ‚ÄúSponge‚Äù Chan</b>: Alan taught me the
    basics of UNIX and how to navigate through that OS, whereas Andrew, he looked
    my age and got me addicted to Atomic Bomberman‚Äìmy rep as a found-out-hacker
    (netbus) stems from Mr. Ma and Sponge‚Ä¶netstat, pings, netbus, trojans, tracert‚Ä¶it‚Äôs
    amazing what I learn in 8 months from these people (the more productive end
    of it is web development)!</li>



<p>
  </p>



<li><b>Natalie Wong, Carey Wan, Henry Chen, and cell-group</b>: The female engineer
    who‚Äôs been teased a lot‚Ä¶but Nat is also quite caring in her own l‚Äôil way.
    I think to this very day, she still sees me as a l‚Äôil girl (I‚Äôve grown up
    a bit now Nat :T). She and Carey were in my cell group and both of them took
    time to talk and help me out whenever I needed it. The rest of my cell group
    showed me what love meant (ex. Kenneth Lam, Samuel Ooi, Tom Cheng(?), Alan
    Wong‚Ä¶.). Henry, he the funny one. We‚Äôd have endless discussions about fundamental
    views of Christianity, played Tetrinet til late (I think he was the one who
    introduced it to me), and provided me places to study (like his office/basement/etc.).
    I think we disagreed more than we agreed on many issues, but I learned from
    him lots; his walk with God affected mine greatly. Henry and Nat and I went
    to the Ontario Science Centre one day and we all got in free because I had
    Science World membership :)!</li>



<p>
  </p>



<li><b>Wayne Pau and Matthew Mark</b></li>


  : Wale?! I donno why Wayne started to call me that, but to this very day, if
  I hear that name, it‚Äôs usually in reference to me and I know it‚Äôs Wayne. Shortly
  after, Matt kept calling me Beast (for what?! o_O ), which soon stemmed to everything
  else as being ‚Äúbeast‚Äù including Clara‚Äôs eating habits. Near the end of first
  year, not only did Matt help me buy a dresser from
  Ikea (near his place) for me to move into TJ‚Äôs place, but he also came down one day from TO to deliver me 2 ‚Äúdj rumble wale CD compilations‚Äù and surprised me with some bubbletea! That was my very
  FIRST bubbletea from Canada ‚Ä¶ (I‚Äôve had it in HK). I was still sleeping (how
  embarassing..hehe, to open the door to see Matt with my ‚Äúsleepy‚Äù look)‚Ä¶but
  it was nevertheless, something I remember =).

<p>
  </p>



<li>CCF event-community outreach: While some people went to Oasis (a homeless
    shelter), a group of us went to Kitchener to Anchor House, a Christian(?)-runned
    Young Offender‚Äôs House. Played foosball with a few of the youth (they‚Äôre in
    there to serve as a sentence for various offences as a substitute for jail
    time) and my eyes were opened that night. One teen, ‚ÄúJ‚Äù, while joking around
    and in good spirits, as soon as his mother was mentioned (or seen), I caught
    a glimpse of his bitterness and a hurting‚Ä¶and was saddened at how much emptiness
    was reflected in his eyes, and how less of an impact that we had on him because
    we were only visiting once, never again to do anymore follow-up or to build
    any deeper friendships with these lost teens.</li>


</ul><i>Second Year</i>


<p>
Vince(?) or asked me to serve at the Welcome Table. Through that ministry, I was able to put more faces to names, and got to know more of the other brothers and sisters in CCF. That year, I moved into WCRI and lived with TJ.
</p>



<ul><li><b>Tai Jing Moyung and Daniel Hsueh</b>: I‚Äôve seen their ups and downs (and had the honour and privilege to attend their wedding last year!), but they (along with Carey, and other Master‚Äôs students) showed me that Masters is a quite a suffering and enduring process. In a sense, TJ was like a big sister and Daniel had an influence in where I am today; he was one of those who supported my decision to switch into RPW, an ‚Äúelite‚Äù program, he said and he respected people like Eva Chan who was already in it.</li>



<p>
</p>



<li><b>Kevin Ho</b>: I don‚Äôt think I knew him until one day, Ken Chung drove himself, Kev, and I for dinner at China Gardens. Shortly after, he asked for my opinion on choosing a set of frames and thus, I believe our friendship began there. I remember him even bringing a Cha Siu Bao over for me once for lunch :).</li>



<p>
</p>



<li><b>Benjamin Abbas</b>: I looked up to him (Sponge and Jen Mok) as ‚ÄúArtsies‚Äù. There weren‚Äôt many people in Arts during those days, and with the many questions of switching into an Arts program were mainly answered and supported by Ben. He also saved me from some strange stalkers a few times. I also had the chance to serve together on commitee and as Sunday School teachers. I really appreciated our friendship over the next few years.</li>



<p>
</p>



<li><b>Vonne Young</b>: I think my see-lai-ness started to become evident on our trip to New York/New Jersey together. I didn‚Äôt know Vonne very well, until somehow, we became travelling companions. I don‚Äôt know how that even came to be, but I thank God for enabling me to get to know her better through this trip, providing me with not only a friend, but a accountability/prayer partner over the years. hahah, $1 pens at the Disney store and my, oh my, to save a few dollars, we walked sooo much! :).</li>


</ul><i>Third Year</i>


<p>
I ended up serving in committee for 1 term and began to teach Sunday School at KWCAC. Ben and I taught together and although I did not feel that I was made for teaching Sunday School, teaching the teens taught me greater patience and love. And, from then on, I‚Äôve come to love the people that I get a chance to share an hour with every Sunday and have the privilege to take part in their spiritual journeys (ex. Wallace becoming a Christian at TC!). And to this very day, although I‚Äôve shared them with others like Daisy, Tania, Josiah, Feng, I wouldn‚Äôt trade them for any other group :).
</p>



<ul><li><b>Sherwin Chim, Gabe Chang, Winnie Wong, Dylan Lum, Benjamin Abbas, Abraham Wong</b>: Okay, I admit, Gabby wasn‚Äôt exactly a committee member, but his dedication and willingness to serve by taking cell groups and prayer meetings under his wing showed his passion for God and for people. I didn‚Äôt know who Sherrie was when he ran for committee, but I‚Äôm glad that I got to know him through our term serving together. The insights that they, along with Winifred, Dill, Pork and Ben, gave and the weekly prayer meetings that we had really shaped up my walk with God. Many nights, Pork helped me with my Flash website, and through serving as co-DL, his questions often challenged me into thinking deeper (‚Äúam i doing this for love or obligation?‚Äù) and desiring to live God‚Äôs word. The committee members met outside of administrative and CCF events, which really helped build greater accountability and deeper friendships.</li>



<p>
</p>



<li><b>Benjamin Cheung</b>: I got to know him through my late nights in the Twinkle lab. His accounting friends would all be working on something, while I worked away on my essays. Our discussions on certain moral questions (e.g. is lying wrong? what about killing?) led into late night chats and massive research for biblically supported answers, but I‚Äôve learned a lot from them as well. Sometimes, Benjamin reminds me of a little kid‚Ä¶I had tons of fun when he was around. Him and Johnny Wong, I‚Äôve sadly lost in touch with‚Ä¶but I still have Ben‚Äôs Point of Grace CD that I have yet to give back to him when I see him‚Ä¶</li>


</ul><i>Fourth Year</i>


<p>
Fourth year was a mess relationally. Had troubles beginning in the summer with more than one relationship, which ended up taking away any trust, sensitivity, compassion I had for anyone in general‚Ä¶one friend even wanted to commit suicide (thank God he didn‚Äôt), my cousin went missing; it was a rough summer (and result, year). I withdrew from many people, not trusting and not knowing who was against me. Miranda Kong isn‚Äôt a CCFer but I thank God for her anyhow, for trying to reach out (for what purpose I don‚Äôt know but she persisted) and for Garvin Lee for the wisdom and maturity he has shown through our conversations, although I‚Äôm sure he doesn‚Äôt think so or realise it.  Funny, I look back now, and although my walk with God dwindled for awhile, the experience prepared me to be patient with people that would have formerly driven me insane within a matter of weeks.
</p>



<p>
Sadly, I can‚Äôt remember anything good about CCF that year; merely a blip in my memory.
</p>



<p> <i>Fifth Year</i>
</p>



<p> I don‚Äôt know Andy Yu or Wayne Chang very well at all, but these two people
  started coming back out and serving in CCF after seeing them maybe once in first
  year, and I‚Äôm encouraged. I‚Äôm encouraged to see them because in first year,
  for awhile, I kept seeing Wayne in the caf and asking him how he‚Äôs doing, noting
  that I didn‚Äôt see him at church etc, and his reason would be, ‚ÄúI slept in.‚Äù
  to the point where I just gave up‚Ä¶but I‚Äôm glad that others continued to minister
  to them.
</p>



<ul><li><b>Jeff Chang</b>: I can‚Äôt remember how I met him, but I do remember thinking that he had so much energy, much like a frosh at NSR. He made it at point to make sure my first term of my last year was one of my better terms (or the ‚Äúbest year‚Äù in his words). He challenged me by asking questions relating to his search for a better relationship with God. He succeeded in slowly drawing me back to CCF. His willing to serve by spending late night working on Insight, on the retreat handbook, by committing to help out with MCCF really reminded me of the fire for God that such young Christians have, and that older Christians should continue to have!</li>



<p>
</p>



<li><b>Jason Wong</b>: Jason literally helped me pass my cs230 algorithms course. He spent countless hours trying to explain and walk through logic with me to successfully progam and complete my assignments. Many times, I would feel on the verge of giving into sleep, but Jason would press to continue onto completion. His heart for God is shown through helping others. To a lesser degree, but still important, other people whom I‚Äôve asked for help that‚Äôs taken some time out to help someone they barely know include: Sam and Tim Ng, Joseph Wong, Waiki Lee, Dave Tse, Dan Tey and my other friends Eric Liu, Jeffrey Kwong, and Terence Wong.</li>



<p>
</p>



<li><b>Mike Mak</b>: I actually don‚Äôt know this guy. Like some say, his quiet nature in large unfamiliar groups, makes him look quite intimidating. However, I got to see the other side of him one day when Waiki, or rather Mike, kept repeating, ‚ÄúI Love You‚Äù on Waiki‚Äôs ICQ. He brought a smile to my face especially when at first I thought Waiki‚Äôs account was hacked, but soon learnt, with Kevin Ho and Pastor Tim‚Äôs help, that it was Mike =). Although I have yet to take up his offer and invitations to Westcourt events this term, his caring nature for others is evident through his actions, which I only attrtibute to God.</li>



<p>
</p>



<li><b>Joseph Wong</b>: I owe him a bubbletea, and much more. Not only did he find me a job in the summer, but the small actions he does is reflective of the gentleman that he is and also reflective of how a brother should treat his sister in Christ. His maturity (and immaturity at times :P) and his willingness to serve God whether in a leadership position or behind-the-scenes is thus reflected in him well.</li>



<p>
</p>



<li><b>Becky Chan</b>: I got to know Becky through our various conversations that we‚Äôd have. I think I‚Äôm drawn to Becky because of the tie she has to ‚Äúhome‚Äù, but she understands and similarly struggles with finding a fellowship to belong in‚Äìto call CCF ‚Äúhome‚Äù. During Winter Retreat, I had the chance to share with what‚Äôs on my mind with both Becky and Anna Chu.</li>



<p>
</p>



<li><b>Steve Wong, Daniel Lee</b>: Their company, especially during the times of studying at the SLC. I have to include Terence Wong here too, for he got me hooked on Daytona for a term while he made sure (and helped) me to stay focused on studying :).</li>


</ul>


And outside of CCF:


<ul><li><b>Jasmine Choi</b>: She cared for our friendship. Jasmine made sure that I didn‚Äôt stay mad at her whenever there was a reason to be‚Ä¶And, along with Joanna, they cared for the people around them. Noteably, she made sure that not only one of us, but both of us were okay.</li>



<p>
</p>



<li><b>Eunice Chiu</b>: She coerced me into being her god-sister, but I still love her. Over the past few months, I think she‚Äôs unknowingly drew out the love for others and the care that I have buried deep within me. Tears have been shed for her (yes, eunie!) and prayers have been said in earnest for God to take care of her. I think she‚Äôs a great part of my life now especially since she calls, like, everyday =) (and the days she doesn‚Äôt call, haha, you don‚Äôt want to know what she‚Äôs doing). I may not agree with her lifestyle, but she‚Äôs challenged me to live a life worthy of His calling in many ways more than one.</li>


</ul>


I know I‚Äôve left out many. With over 186 UWCCFers that I‚Äôve come in contact with over my 5 years here, it‚Äôs impossible to name them all. I would leave you with Philippians 1:3-6, but because that‚Äôs been overdone lately, I shall leave you with another. Jesus says in Matthew 5:3-10:


<blockquote>
   Blessed are the poor in spirit, <br>
       for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. <br>
    Blessed are those who mourn, <br>
       for they will be comforted. <br>
    Blessed are the meek, <br>
       for they will inherit the earth. <br>
    Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness,<br>
       for they will be filled. <br>
    Blessed are the merciful, <br>
       for they will be shown mercy. <br>
    Blessed are the pure in heart, <br>
       for they will see God. <br>
    Blessed are the peacemakers, <br>
       for they will be called sons of God. <br>
    Blessed are those who are persecuted because of righteousness, <br>
       for theirs is the kingdom of heaven
 </blockquote>


Or as the Message translates it:


<blockquote>
You‚Äôre blessed when you‚Äôre at the end of your rope.<br>
With less of you there is more of God and his rule.<br>
You‚Äôre blessed when you feel you‚Äôve lost what is most dear to you.<br>
Only then can you be embraced by the One most dear to you.<br>
You‚Äôre blessed when you‚Äôre content with just who you are‚Äìno more, no less.<br>
That‚Äôs the moment you find yourselves proud owners of everything that can‚Äôt be bought.<br>
You‚Äôre blessed when you‚Äôve worked up a good appetite for God.<br>
He‚Äôs food and drink in the best meal you‚Äôll ever eat.<br>
You‚Äôre blessed when you care.<br>
At the moment of being ‚Äúcareful,‚Äô you find yourselves cared for.<br>
You‚Äôre blessed when you get your inside world‚Äìyour mind and heart‚Äìput right.<br>
Then you can see God in the outside world.<br>
You‚Äôre blessed when you can show people how to cooperate instead of compete or fight.<br>
That‚Äôs when you discover who you really are, and your place in God‚Äôs family.<br>
You‚Äôre blessed when your commitment to God provokes persecution. <br>
The persecution drives you even deeper into God‚Äôs kingdom.
</blockquote>
