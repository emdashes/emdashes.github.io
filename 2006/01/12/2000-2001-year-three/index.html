		<p>				CCF and me. 
  

</p><p>Hearing the voice of God and following His will is never easy, at least not
    for me. Most of the time, it’s not even about obedience, but rather,
    I struggle with the first part–listening and being able to recognise the
    voice of God. Maybe I’m a literalist, and if so, I admit that I am not
    able to discern the will of God through a still small voice, unlike Samuel
    in the Bible. I thought I was different because I remember in my high school
    fellowship one year, a speaker distinctly told us that she literally heard
    God’s voice calling her to serve at YWAM (Youth With A Mission), a Christian
    organisation that has a focus in inner-city missions. I could not identify
    with her, for God definitely did not speak to me in that way. Many times,
    I just figured that my spiritual walk was not mature enough even though I
    saw God at work through other means. However, I must say, I do believe that
    God works through my life, in the lives of others, and through different circumstances,
    to show me what I need to do to follow and glorify Him. </p>


  

<p>So if you ask me why I’m serving on CCF (Chinese Christian Fellowship)
    committee this term, I would not be able to give you a solid answer. I cannot
    say that I heard God’s voice because I don’t “hear” His
    voice. I cannot say I was called either, because I was not convicted and my
    conscience has not been nagging me for saying “no” since the end
    of my 1B term. I wasn’t dying to serve on committee either. If you have
    not already noticed, I’m not a very vocal person, especially in large
    groups. Apparently, I’m a task-structured person, which explains why
    I don’t exactly like sharing about myself because I don’t know what
    to say unless I’m answering a series of questions. Unfortunately, when
    sharing, there are no questions to answer. I also remember that the girls
    in previous committees were so passionate that they would cry during their
    sharing. Don’t get me wrong, crying is okay and it doesn’t show
    signs of weakness, but I just hope I don’t do that. Anyway, onto my sharing
    . . . </p>


  

<p>How then did I end up on committee if I didn’t feel a strong calling from
    God? For some odd reason, I had a feeling that I most likely would be asked
    one day to serve on committee even before I came to Waterloo. Why? Before
    heading out to Waterloo, my mother cautioned me against saying “yes”
    to committee too quickly for fear of falling behind in my studies. She seem
    to have known that I was likely to be involved in a fellowship, perhaps because
    she saw how much time was spent as a committee member for 2 years in my youth
    fellowship. </p>


  

<p>In my last year of high school, I decided to further explore CCF at Waterloo
    by finding their site online and e-mailing them a series of questions. I was
    all ready to go to a Chinese speaking fellowship when Dylan surprised me by
    saying that CCF is held in English and less than half of the people were even
    Chinese speaking! Ironically and amusingly, when I later met Dylan face to
    face, I realised that he didn’t even know much Chinese in the first place.
  </p>


  

<p>I was slightly disappointed at the fact that CCF wasn’t as Chinese as
    I expected. Even though I am a “jok-sing”, as people like to term
    us CBCs, I was ready to try another Chinese fellowship. I was encouraged to
    see Sandra lead some praise and worship songs at the NSR Dinner (perhaps even
    Praise and Worship night too) in Chinese and with the English “pinyin”
    underneath. I was very impressed :). To also learn that at one point CCF was
    led entirely in Chinese and the ratio of Chinese speaking to the English speaking
    was almost exponentially declining every year, was saddening especially since
    I saw more and more people speak Chinese around campus. Additionally, an exchange
    student from Hong Kong shared with us his experience with CCF, which impacted
    and challenged the ones that were left to carry on his vision once he returned
    home. Perhaps that is why I have always felt the burden to reach out to the
    Cantonese or even Mandarin-speaking, even to the point where I offered to
    lead a mixed English/Mandarin-speaking cell group in my 3A term. Yes, even
    though, “wo de guo yu bu hao; wo bu ke yi jiang, ye dou bu dong.”
  </p>


  

<p>I felt at home in CCF even in my first term. Although I must admit that I
    had trouble making friends that were my own age group, the people I got to
    know really influenced me. Most of them who had touched my life have already
    graduated and I am encouraged at what they have left behind, or what they
    still see in CCF. I glance back into time, and realise that it is through
    cell groups that I have learned the most. That is why cell groups are also
    very important to me. There were days that I only had fun and did not learn
    anything spiritual, but I learned from the people in the cell groups. They
    taught me a lot, especially through life example (okay, for life example,
    maybe excluding Carey in certain cases . . . well, maybe what not to do).
    These people influenced my ways of thinking, and how I act today. If they
    did not pay any attention to young frosh like myself, I may not have continued
    to attend CCF. I may have listened to a certain campus fellowship that regarded
    CCF as being less important because they saw that reaching out to Chinese
    was merely reaching out to a tiny portion of the bigger picture. But, I’m
    glad I didn’t. I’m glad I saw the importance of reaching out to
    people of the Chinese culture and that CCF took care to look after the frosh.
  </p>


  

<p>Although I did not get a distinct calling to serve on committee, nor had
    a choice on what position to take, I can say that my experience on committee
    thus far, has definitely been worthwhile. My first impression of serving in
    committee was meetings, meetings, and more meetings, especially in the first
    couple of weeks. Interestingly enough, Dylan said that meetings were one of
    his favourite pastimes. I thought that he was crazy. Well, I’m not so
    sure myself anymore. He still may be crazy, but I have to agree that meetings
    are similar to cell groups in itself and are very much enjoyable, especially
    prayer meetings. We share so much with each other, including laughter and
    Dill’s crisis of the week, and Pork’s (ahem, Abe’s) super long
    prayer requests 😛 . I learn a lot from these people and by serving on committee,
    I also see the fervour in encouraging other CCF members to be actively involved
    with campus ministry. I see “vision” being lived out. </p>


  

<p>The term vision has been overused since my first year, but at least I understand
    what the difference between purpose, vision, and mission of CCF now. I realise
    (with the help of Peter Lau) that the vision of CCF is the big picture of
    what God wants us to accomplish to advance his kingdom, the mission is the
    objective(s) set to help fulfill the vision, and finally, the purpose is why
    CCF exists. With those definitions, I can place evangelism under vision with
    certainty and short and long-term goals (programs, active ministries, etc.)
    with mission. Why CCF exists? Well, I would say it would ultimately be to
    carry out the Great Commission as set out by Jesus in Matthew 28:19-20. Additionally,
    I would say that because we are the Chinese Christian Fellowship, we are set
    apart from the rest of the fellowships because we have our roots in the Chinese
    heritage and therefore, we are the key to reach the Chinese–be it Mandarin
    or Cantonese-speaking, or even the CBCs! I don’t feel as hopeless or
    as helpless as I did in first year, and I can better support the fellowship
    because I understand where CCF is going, or at least trying to go. Most importantly,
    I see what steps CCF will take to continue to reach out to those on campus.
  </p>


  

<p>Back to the question, so after all this has been said, why am I on committee?
    Well, like I have previously said I have no “real” reason. My only
    reason is because I ran out of excuses. Last term I promised God that if my
    marks turned out well in my first term in English, I would say “yes”
    to anyone who asked me to serve on committee. With God’s sense of humour,
    He gave me the highest average that I have ever seen on my transcript in my
    university career. I’m thankful for my marks and because of what I promised
    before, how could I say “no” when Dill asked me? So that’s
    my tale. </p>


  

<p>NB. Most references to “Chinese” refers to the Cantonese dialect.
