    Incomplete Transcript</p>


  

<p><i>What is your name and please tell everyone a little bit about yourself
    (i.e. background about what you are doing now; school, GCN, teaching, etc)?</i></p>


  

<p><b>Me:</b> Hi. This is actually my first year at Campus Challenge because
    I normally go home every year. I am originally from Vancouver, BC but I am
    currently working in Ottawa for the summer. In September, I will be entering
    my 4th year as an undergraduate student at the University of Waterloo. As
    much as I would like to say that I am studying CS or Engineering or something
    that Waterloo is known for, I am not. I’m actually majoring in English by
    choice. =)</p>


  

<p><b>Nat:</b> My name is Natalie Wong. I am currently a grad student at UT.
    My current field of studies is in Electrical Engineering. This is my first
    year at UT. I previously completed my undergrad program at U. Waterloo. </p>


  

<p>I have accepted Christ right before entering university. Throughout my undergrad
    years, I have been serving in Waterloo CCF (in cell groups, IBS groups, in
    the committee, etc.) God has revealed himself most to me during these years,
    which has ultimately shaped my life as an individual. I believe that the years
    we spend in university is the most crucial turning point in our life journey.
    At the same time, the campus setting is truly unique, where students are most
    exposed to higher learning and a broader worldview. Some say that university
    life prepares you for the real world. In actual fact, the university life
    is the real world. In this type of setting, it is so important for us, as
    Chinese Christian students, to integrate our faith into our studies, to live
    out our Christian lives, and to bring forth Christ’s love on campus where
    there is such a need. </p>


  

<p> <i>What changes have you been observing about your respective campuses recently?</i>


    <b>Me: </b>Well, first there are visual changes that make it obvious that
    the university is slowly expanding. If you walk around our campus, you see
    that many buildings are either renovating or expanding. New classrooms and
    offices are implemented and new buildings for classes or other student/campus
    services are being constructed as well. Even the School of Architecture is
    relocating to a new building in Cambridge in 2003.


    Another clue that the university population is growing is the number of new
    buildings that are designated to be residences for frosh only. I think that
    UW realises that many universities in Ontario are guaranteeing residence for
    the frosh, so they need to be just as competitive. Last year, they had one
    new building, but in the coming years, they plan to have at least 3 more.


    There are also less obvious changes. Even though my program has next to zero
    Chinese-speaking students, I notice that there is an influx of graduate students
    that are from Mainland China, the increase of number of campus clubs, growth
    in attendance in fellowship and local churches. Additionally, in the UW daily
    info, the bulletin often announces special talks with guest speakers that
    talk about the “double cohort” issue.</p>


  

<p>Changes in technology seem to be implemented including the ability to allow
    students to check their marks online (instead of just relying through the
    mail) beginning the Fall term, the Faculty of Arts will also be using percentages
    to determine final grades instead of placing students in a range of letters,
    and students are able to choose their own timetable now (including view a
    list of professors who are teaching in the next term).</p>


  

<p> <b>Nat:</b> As a grad student, I am constantly interacting with many other
    grad students in electrical engineering. One of the trends that I’ve noticed
    about the campus is that there are a lot of international students – both
    in the graduate level and the undergrad level. In general, many of them come
    from Mainland China and Hong Kong, and also from Muslim countries such as
    Iran, Pakistan, and India. They come to Canada under as a VISA student, and
    most of them are actually quite mature in age. Many of them have their own
    families with them (i.e. Spouse and children). And definitely, these grad
    students are highly intellectual people. </p>


  

<p>Another thing that I notice about my campus is that there has been a lack
    of faculty members. One reason for this is because a large number of professors
    are at an age of retirement. Another reason that is occurring is that many
    engineering professors are “starting-up” their own companies, and
    patenting their own research ideas. As a result of this, a lack of faculty
    members trickles down to many uncertainties. </p>


  

<p> In a way, the double cohort situation brings forth a great deal of anxiety
    to the high school students, as well as to the Ontario universities. Will
    there be quality educators to teach them? How will they be able to excel in
    their studies in such a competitive environment? What kind of career path
    will this lead them to? These are some of the questions that would arise.
  </p>


  

<p>More and more professors are relying on their grad students to teach the
    course materials. Interestingly enough, grad students are regarded as part
    of the faculty. And therefore, due to the large increase in university enrolment,
    the Ontario universities have been trying to lobby the government to increase
    funding to attract intellectual grad students from all over the world, and
    hopefully, to hire new faculty educators. As our UT President, Robert Birgeneau
    says, research universities are the prime source of the qualified researchers
    and teachers who people our nation’s research, educational and industrial
    enterprise.” </p>


  

<p>Overall, the double cohort issue isn’t simply an issue that is affecting
    the undergraduate level. </p>


  

<p><i> As an undergraduate student, who may see the large influx of students,
    what do all this issues mean to you? How do you see your role fit in the changing
    university campuses?<br></i><br><b>Me:</b> Because I only have approximately 1.5 years left as an undergrad
    student, I won’t be immediately and directly affected by any changes that
    might occur in 2003. However, it doesn’t mean that I can be passive now because
    I can only imagine how many challenges are ahead. As a high school graduate,
    it was already difficult enough to apply to any program in Waterloo because
    of its good reputation and various programs. I remember that back then, students
    need a 95% Grade 12 GPA just to be considered for Computer Engineering or
    CS at Waterloo, along with a high score in the Descartes math contest. I can
    see that eventually, due to the mass number of students applying to Ontario
    universities in 2003, many universities may withdraw their offers of scholarships,
    or they will offer it only to the top 5% of the class, which would mean that
    as an student, there will be more academic competition, and increasing pressure
    to excel.</p>


  

<p> To keep a limit, UW has set a max increase of 15% in 2003, and plans to
    balance the influx of students in 2004. Teachers of Ontario high schools are
    even encouraging their students to stay behind an extra year for the optional
    OAC. However, even if there was not an influx of students at UW, I have noticed
    a trend that many high school seniors are entering universities immediately
    after graduation instead of taking time off to work or transferring credits
    from college-most likely because of the increasing demand of degrees from
    various companies. Other universities are also affected by the “double
    cohort”-even universities outside of Ontario. A university in New Brunswick
    anticipates to accept more students in 2003, so they are already beginning
    to expand their building as well.</p>


  

<p>As a student, my primary role on campus is to be a student, focusing on my
    academics. However, as a Christian on a changing campus, it would be a greater
    challenge to reach out because there will a greater need to bring the lost
    to Christ. Now would be the time to start as the student after us will be
    following in our footsteps. I now realise how much easier it is to reach out
    as a student than as in the career field. In Vancouver, I have friends from
    my days in high school who are non-Christians, but in Ottawa, I have yet to
    meet someone who is unchurched aside from my co-workers, who are more mature
    in age and live separate lives with their families and friends.<br></p>


  

<p><i>As a grad student who has frequent encounters with faculty members and
    grad students, as well as undergrad students, how do you see your role fit
    on campus in light of the changes going on in Ontario universities?</i></p>


  

<p><b>Nat:</b> To be honest, with the marks that I had coming into UT for grad
    studies, I honestly didn’t expect that God would open up the door for me to
    be at UT. After receiving my letter of acceptance, I know that God had many
    things in store for me. To tell you the truth, it hasn’t been an easy journey
    in grad school. The life of a grad student is not the same as an undergrad.
    I’m most thankful for UTCCF to have been there always in support of me through
    their love, and through prayer. But there are many overseas students who endure
    struggles much more different than what we (who live in Canada for many years)
    endure. They must struggle with English, to do well in school in order to
    maintain their status as a VISA student, and most often, their lives evolve
    around their research. </p>


  

<p>To answer the question of what I see my role on campus is, right now I know
    that I must focus on my graduate studies given that God has granted me to
    study here. At the same time, I hope to be more involved with the grad ministry,
    and to build strong bonds with my fellow classmates and professors. CCF is
    also a big part of me, and so, I will definitely support the Chinese Christian
    ministries. Most of all, I really hope to be a good witness for Christ in
    my graduate program, as many of them do not know Christ and may not have a
    concept of God. </p>


  

<p><i>As a student who have been in leadership position in a Chinese Christian
    fellowship, what implications do these changes on campus mean to the A/CCF
    on campus?</i>


    <b>Me:</b> Firstly, as anything I said earlier, my opinions reflect what I
    see or have experienced at UW only. UWCCF may be different than the A/CCF’s
    elsewhere because we average to approximately 100 people on a busy term, and
    it’s comprised of students from 2 different universities: WLU and UW. We also
    lead almost everything in English. Because of the changing environment/dynamics
    of the types of students are that our on our campuses, it would first mean
    that we need to be aware of such issues and people. At this time, I feel that
    UWCCF is already starting to prepare by taking care of the frosh in more effective
    ways. We also need to look for a bigger room soon to accommodate the increase
    of numbers in attendance. And for a campus fellowship to be known, we need
    to be an active presence on campus and to focus on reaching outwardly more
    so than inwardly-one example is to focus on evangelism instead of discipleship.
    Yes, I do agree that discipleship is important, but evangelism is extremely
    important as well. One example is that last term, CCF focused their programs
    on evangelism (and this term people are encouraged to bring a new friend every
    week), whereas the cell groups and prayer meetings were more focused on discipleship
    and accountability. As previous Campus Challenges have emphasised, we also
    need leaders to pass the torch along to the future generation of students.
    CCF may be one of the bigger fellowships at UW, and so we need to perhaps
    work together with the others on campus to be even more effective as one body
    in Christ and most definitely-to pray for our campuses, including for us to
    have the compassion and a heart for the people.</p>


  

<p> There are different groups to cater to on campus, there are not only the
    CBCs/non-Chinese (as we are more comfortable to reaching out to), but there
    are also the graduate students, and those who are Cantonese/Mandarin speaking
    as well.</p>


  

<p><i>What would you recommend CCF to do now to better position themselves?</i></p>


  

<p><b>Nat:</b></p>




<ul><li> Two key words that I would hope that every Chinese Christian group have are:
  Visibility and Prayer</li>


  

<li> The first aspect I want to stress is “Christian Visibility”.
  Most often, CCF can be so self-contained, sometimes becoming an entity of its
  own. I find that most often, CCF’s do not realizing what goes on beyond their
  Christian circle. While the whole society is changing, we are not keeping up
  with them. And we are definitely not equipping ourselves to be better warriors
  for Christ.</li>




<li>Christian Visibility is important because CCF is there on campus for the campus.
  I hope every Christian student recognize that. CCF is there on campus for the
  campus! It is NOT a support group for the Christian students. We should be more
  visible, much more than before, especially in times like these. To let the students
  to know that there is an absolute truth in this pluralistic environment. To
  let the students know that Jesus Christ loves them.</li>


 

<li>The second aspect I want to stress is “Prayer”. It is so
    easy to get burnt out when serving in our respective campus Christian fellowships.
    Trying to juggle with school and with serving God in the campus ministries
    is very tough. We always fall into the trap of “doing” things, rather
    than reflecting upon what we are doing, and why we’re doing it.</li>


  

<li> Instead, I really hope that every one of us who are part of our campuses
    would just stop what they are doing, and come before God in prayer. There
    is such a need for prayers for the campus. Do we honestly pray enough for
    our classmates, for our professors, for the campus as a whole?</li>


	</ul><p>I want to challenge all of you to think about your campus as a mission field.
    With any mission field, each missionary prepares their hearts to listen and
    to obey God’s guidance. Despite the fact that the mission is full of hardships,
    we learn to love those whom we come in contact with during the mission. We
    cannot do much for Christ if we aren’t close to Him in prayer, and it would
    be worthless if we were to serve without love for our mission field. </p>




<p><i>If there were one overarching idea that you would want the current students
  on campus to have as a result of this forum, what would it be?</i></p>




<p><b>Nat:</b> During the UTCCF winter retreat, our speaker Pui-Wing Wong (who
  is also a Waterloo alumni) challenged us to think about what sort of reputation
  do we as a fellowship portray to the rest of the campus. During Pui-Wing’s time,
  he shared that CCF had a reputation for their investigative bible studies. His
  sharing really made us think…</p>


  

<p>So what kind of mark do you want to leave on your campus?</p>




<p>
    The Campus Challenge is “You are here”, not only to challenge us
    to think about why we are here on campus now, but also to look to the future
    as well. I hope that through this whole weekend, we would all be more aware
    of what goes on in our campuses. I hope that through this forum, it will really
    challenge everyone to think about his or her positions on campus.
  </p>
