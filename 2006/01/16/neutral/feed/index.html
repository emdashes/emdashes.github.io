					<description><![CDATA[when stopped
- depending on the car, it may save you gas when you&#039;re idling, you may notice your RPM&#039;s are lower.
- will reduce shake, b/c your car is not trying to pull ahead while you are braking &#038; stopped
- BUT, bad b/c you may need to suddenly accelerate away, and cannot do so as quickly since you have to shift BACK into gear. (then again, in older days, manual drivers were encouraged to actually shift to neutral, rather than leaving it in gear and stepping on the clutch.  reason being to prevent premature wear of the clutch plate spring. I think sytems may have improved in the last 5 years.)
agreed on the pressure change in your torque converter when switching in and out of neutral. but if your RPM is sufficiently low when shifting BACK into gear, it&#039;s unnoticable. (ie, when stopped, don&#039;t stomp on the gas THEN shift into gear.  into gear first)
WHILE STOPPING:
a) bad idea on roads with poor traction.  your wheels are more prone to lock up.
b) reduces gas consumption marginally as your RPM&#039;s reduce to idle instantly (\~6-900) rather than gradually as the car speed decreases. -- related to maintaining relatively constant forces in your torque converter.
c) depending on your car gearing, it may or may not require more braking force.  Toyotas don&#039;t slow down as quickly when you let of the gas (due to engine compression) b/c of the transmission gearing. these cars will coast for a LONG time. american, german and sportier transmissions have a lower gearing, and once you let off the gas, the car quickly begins to decelerate.
end result: under good road conditions, you can often stop a car quicker in neutral.
in real emergency, you&#039;ve got three choices.
1) neutral and brake hard, locking wheels -- dry road only please
2) downshift and brake hard (ok with ABS)
3) just brake hard
options 1 &#038; 2 should stop shorter.
summary:
it may make a difference in gas, but imperceptible.
it does make a difference in control, but depends on how automagic your car is.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Neutral braking wears out the brakes because all AT engines in this day and age are designed to provide engine assisted braking which takes a load off the brakes.
If at high rev, you suddenly pop the car in neutral, the pressure inside the transmission would also momentarily become abnormally high (high rev with suddenly no resistance) which will also eventually cause additional damage.
The majority of the cars you drive today are optimized for &quot;normal&quot; driving. Anything outside of the predicted norm would provide less than optimal performance.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Popping a car in neutral while braking will:

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve heard instructors say that this is generally a bad practice.  You don&#039;t save much gas and you risk not being in gear if something unpredictable happens.
I&#039;ve never heard anyone advise people to shift their auto into neutral.  I think the only people who do it do so out of habit from driving a stick.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The one that gets me is that every time I&#039;m about to start a car with an automatic transmission, I awkwardly stomp on the brake with my left foot.
...or suddenly panic when I&#039;m coming to a stop and realize that I haven&#039;t pushed in the clutch.
YMMV
