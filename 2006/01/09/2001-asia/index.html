    As we left the house at 8:54 AM PST, a white VW Beetle drove by and surprised
    us all when we saw that it was a courtesy car from a car dealer. That must
    be a sweet deal for the person who brought her (I‚Äôm assuming, as Beetles are
    more suited as a chic car) car into the shop for repairs-unless of course,
    she was driving a Beetle herself.
  

</p><p>9:41 AM <br>
    A riced neon roars by with spoiler/rear wing, body kit, lights, muffler and
    paint job. Very disturbing to the eyes and ears. And if that wasn‚Äôt enough,
    at 11:53 AM, we boarded a plane full of fobs (a big surprise here). One realization
    came to my brother and I though. The Hongers cannot be fobs, b/c they didn‚Äôt
    get off the plane to land in HK, so does that mean we, the CBCs, are fobs
    in HK?! </p>


  

<p>A small A340. I cannot tell the difference between that and a 767. But it
    seemed scarier that a plane that is almost the same size as the 767 (the plane
    that took me from Ontario to British Columbia), would carry me 12 hours to
    HK! Prior to takeoff, I sneaked a magazine off the executive-class (I think)
    shelf and shocked my mother into asking me if my ‚Äúboyfriends‚Äù in
    Ottawa were interested in cars, because it was entitled, ‚ÄúCar & Driver‚Äù-there
    are some interesting things in that magazine. It beats the one on street racing
    and car parts that my brother bought before we boarded. </p>


  

<p>Saturday, August 18, 2001 </p>


  

<p>17:05 HK Standard Time <br>
    Heat wasn‚Äôt too bad the first day. It kinda reminded me of extreme Ottawa
    heat at 32 C (excluding humidity). </p>


  

<p>21:00 <br>
    Dinner at some restaurant that I have never been to-probably because my grandfather
    would have never approved of this food and ‚Äúlow classness‚Äù if he
    was still around. I enjoyed my first quail from HK (since 98), and had yummy
    ‚Äútong choy‚Äù (or ‚Äúoong choy‚Äù), even though I just had some
    before I left Ottawa. </p>


  

<p>I actually went shopping in HK. My first stop was at Bossini, where I proceeded
    to buy clothes that actually fit me! At $6 CDN, the black cubic-zuchornia
    (however you spell that word-in any case, they remind me of diamonds), strapped
    top was definitely a good bargain! In HK, the exchange rate was on the average
    about $5 HKD: $1 CDN. I can‚Äôt believe that in HK, of all places, there are
    actually people who rice their cars-whatever for?! By the way, in case you
    don‚Äôt understand some Ottawa lingo-like my brother, I will explain some terms
    here and there: ‚Äúrice‚Äù is the same thing as ‚Äúsoup‚Äù or
    ‚Äúaccessorize‚Äù when it comes to cars. </p>


  

<p>23:00 <br>
    Why, you ask, am I using army or Quebec style of time?! Actually, I‚Äôm not
    sure. I think I picked it up in one of the mystery books that I useta read
    and I liked that system because it‚Äôs so unique and causes less confusion.
    I remember that in Waterloo, Carey used it many times to organize cell group
    meetings and all, and even though I had to constantly subtract the last digit
    by 2, to determine the time, it kinda stuck. </p>


  

<p>Surprising, I went to bed by 23:00. I was tired. But not really jet-lagged
    b/c I didn‚Äôt wake up ‚Äôtil the next morning (unlike in ‚Äô93 when I woke up at
    4:00 and couldn‚Äôt go back to sleep). </p>


  

<p>Sunday, August 19, 2001 </p>


  

<p>I started having dreams again. That night, I dreamt that that I was on the
    verge of missing my third exam in the examination period. I was talking to
    Jen (Waterloo classmate at one point in time and good friend), and suddenly
    realised that it was the 17th, and that I had exams scheduled on the 15th,
    16th, 17th, 30th, and 31st of August. I was supposed to be writing a geometry
    test on that day and was freaking out b/c all of my finals were worth 40%
    (sounds like high school!) and I had already missed 2. </p>


  

<p>That morning, at around 10:30, we headed to a Whampoa Alliance Church, a
    small Chinese church that played really old contemporary music and hymns,
    much more older than OCAC‚Äôs style of worship. The funny thing is that the
    name, ‚ÄúWhampoa‚Äù, actually sounds more Flip or of some other ethnicity
    other than Chinese. The sermon was considerably easy to understand, considering
    I had my Palm with me with the NIV bible on it, and the speaker was talking
    about the Prayer of Jabez. All I needed to do was to read my newly acquired
    book, The Prayer of Jabez, a gift from the Billy Graham Ministry, to understand
    the whole sermon. What shocked me, when I read the book, was that the pastor
    took everything from the book, including the analogies. </p>


  

<p>Lunch at 12:50. I have never realised that a Chinese custom of reserving
    a table is to stand behind a seated party and wait for them to leave before
    you grab their seats. I‚Äôve realised why Dom says that he‚Äôs sick of Chinese
    food-you can only have so much dim sum before you get sick of it too. Especially
    if you have dim sum for breakfast, dim sum for lunch . . . thank God that
    it wasn‚Äôt dim sum for dinner! Although, we did go to a restaurant across the
    street from our place for dinner, that DOES serve dim sum during the day.
    üôÇ </p>


  

<p>Upon arriving to that restaurant at 19:47, memories flooded me as I recalled
    having some tea or some sauce spilt on me by the waiter in 98-that was when
    I realised how effective Shout (shout it out!) was and I have been using it
    ever since (great way for some advertising eh? :P). I think my grandmother
    is a VIP customer there, because the service was so good and the waitresses
    knew her name (well, last name anyhow). They offered tea 4 times, because
    we were drinking sugar cane juice instead. Yum! </p>


  

<p>My sister, being a Broadway freak, decided to sing a song from Annie, in
    the middle of the evening, and for the rest of the night, I had the chorus,
    ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a hard-knocked life . . .‚Äù going around in my head-not the
    actual song mind you, but the one that Silq kept playing in Ottawa. </p>


  

<p>During that day, I made a couple of general observations: </p>


  

<p>My brother kept wanting to play with my Palm. <br>
    There are really odd-looking cars in HK, and cars that aren‚Äôt seen here in
    Canada, like the Mitsubishi Lancer. <br>
    Internet withdrawal is no fun at all. And even though there is a cyber caf√©
    right next door, my parents didn‚Äôt think it was safe for me to wander down
    there. <br>
    Monday, August 20, 2001 <br>
    Another night of strange dreams including a portion where I was shooting at
    people with a gun made of Lego, and another, where I was at a banquet with
    a family (parents) I didn‚Äôt know very well with one other person I knew I
    think. </p>


  

<p>Off to Ocean Park we went. My third time there (‚Äô82, ‚Äô93, ‚Äô01), but this
    time, we went with our cousins and my aunt. That day, I decided to wear shorts
    (because it was very sunny and hot). It was a good and a bad thing: the good
    part was that I was able to get a slight tan line (which seems to have disappeared
    already), and the bad was that I managed to obtain 5 very itchy mosquito bites-all
    at one ride: the Raging River. Consequently, I never wore shorts outdoors
    again during my trip. The Raging River was located under trees (provides the
    bugs shade), and it had really dirty water (nice place for them to lurk),
    but the ride was fun-didn‚Äôt close my eyes this time when we dropped! üôÇ The
    Dragon, which is a roller coaster boasting to be the biggest in HK, was once
    again fun and this time, I didn‚Äôt close my eyes for the loops as I did in
    93, either ;). The Flying Swing is much like the one at PNE/Playland-very
    calm and soothing. However, the virtual ride does not compare to the one in
    Universal Studios, Hollywood at all! This one lasted maybe a mere 5 minutes
    and it wasn‚Äôt too ‚Äúextreme‚Äù (too bad). One funny incident that almost
    costed my mother her ankle, was that we were talking about bats and all of
    a sudden, a couple of black butterflies flew around us, and I screamed, ‚ÄúBAT!‚Äù-heheh,
    my mom freaked. </p>


  

<p>Dinner was spent at my aunt‚Äôs. Her maid cooked up some yummy meal, and surprised
    us all because when she first started her job at my aunt/uncle‚Äôs place, she
    didn‚Äôt know how to cook so she read off some cookbooks that my aunt bought
    for her (b/c she useta be a supervisor for the rest of the maids at some temperamental,
    rich famous guy‚Äôs place). I later realised how well off that area was, especially
    with so many nice cars, and a somewhat famous singer by the name of Shirley
    Kwan (admittedly, whom I have never heard) that lives next-door. </p>


  

<p>Tuesday, August 21, 2001 </p>


  

<p>More interesting dreams. One of them I attended a small church fellowship
    in HK and one of the guys made me feel welcome and asked me where I was from,
    etc. etc. </p>


  

<p>Cold water showers are so much warmer than cold water showers at night. I
    don‚Äôt like taking cold showers in general, but I didn‚Äôt know how to work the
    hot water. I later realised that you had to wait a couple of minutes before
    each tiny change of temperature would take into effect. </p>


  

<p>I accompanied my mother and my aunt and my sister in hopes that I would be
    able to buy something while my mom was shopping for shoes. Unfortunately,
    she literally stuck to the plan and for many hours straight, all we did was
    look at shoes. Thankfully, I managed to purchase something, not exactly what
    I was looking for (clothes), but oh well, a pair of sandals for $20 CDN is
    still pretty good :). Thankfully, we got a break from shopping in the evening,
    when we went bowling at the Hong Kong Cricket Club that my aunt‚Äôs family belongs
    to in Happy Valley. Yes, my aunt‚Äôs garage alone in Happy Valley is home to
    some nice cars: Audi TT, Porsche Boxter, a Ferrari of some sort. Others that
    zoom by include Z3s, s2000s, and 911s, MR2 (not Spyder though). Skyline seen
    in Tsim Sha Tsui. </p>


  

<p>Wednesday, August 22, 2001 </p>


  

<p>I think I‚Äôm a l‚Äôil ‚ÄúOttawa‚Äù-sick because my dreams that evening,
    had Dom, Josh, and Marc in them. In one of my dreams, I figured that if ‚ÄúMelancholy‚Äù
    didn‚Äôt have such a depressing association with it, it would be a nice name
    b/c it‚Äôs 4 syllables in length and one could shorten it to ‚ÄúMel‚Äù.
  </p>


  

<p>Today, we went bowling yet again. I seem to only bowl well with a 9 lb bowling
    ball. The unfortunate thing was that there was only 1 of those available to
    be shared w 4 lanes. Everything else ends up in the gutter. Sigh :\. I don‚Äôt
    think I‚Äôve ever bowled this many times in a week before. </p>


  

<p>We also went to the CityPlaza Shopping Centre and while my mom shopped for
    shoes, my sis and I decided to explore the rest of the place and discovered
    that the Disney Store had a closing sale and everything was ¬Ω price
    off the lowest ticketed price!! We were lucky (I don‚Äôt believe in luck) because
    2 days after when we went again, it was already closed. I bought a couple
    of items, including a Mulan VHS video (in Cantonese) for $8 CDN. However,
    in my AV ignorance, I didn‚Äôt realise that the videos in HK could not play
    in Canadian VCRs unless one has a dual VCR (which we don‚Äôt). I also bought
    two ¬æ-sleeve shirts for $9 CDN each at U2. </p>


  

<p>Thursday, August 23, 2001 </p>


  

<p>Our family and my grandmother left HK early to take the train to Shenzhen
    (45 min to 1 hr train ride). I think I understand why we like to stereotype
    ‚Äúbig green‚Äù people-most have a less sophisticated lifestyle than
    the average HK resident. If you ask me to go to Shenzhen again, I think I‚Äôd
    have to think twice. </p>


  

<p>We stopped at a restaurant for some lunch. There, I discovered that using
    tea to wash dishes in TO or Ottawa is nothing compared to what they do in
    China; they actually give you a bowl of tea to rinse your dishes in before
    they take the dirty tea bowl away. And I thought that was bad. The dim sum
    is the most disgusting restaurant food I‚Äôve had in a very long time! I refused
    to eat the pork spareribs because my mom told me that they went bad, and my
    shark-fin dumpling soup tasted like ‚Äúsoap water‚Äù (gan-sui). Most
    people in Shenzhen speak Mandarin (and only understand Mandarin) now, even
    though this was originally a place of Canton descent. Getting around this
    area would be difficult if one did not know any Chinese at all. The maid (who
    is 23 years old), at the place where I was staying, was surprised to learn
    that I did not speak or know any Mandarin (well, ‚Äúany‚Äù is almost
    right considering China Mandarin is not what I know). I don‚Äôt think she realises
    that in Canada, not every ‚Äújook sing‚Äù is bilingual in Cantonese
    and Mandarin. And if a ‚Äújook sing‚Äù is fluent in one of these dialects,
    that is already pretty impressive in itself. </p>


  

<p>Shopping. Negotiating is not something I‚Äôm professionally good at-so I leave
    all the negotiating with my mom. Somehow, we ended up negotiating a cell-phone
    cover from 10 RMB (Ren Men Bi?-China currency is 10% less than HK) to about
    6 RMB (that‚Äôs around $1 CDN). In retrospect, I believe that we could‚Äôve done
    better. Ah well. It‚Äôs only $1. </p>


  

<p>That night, we went to some cultural centre to view a costume poetic performance.
    Many tourists from HK were there. Thankfully, it took place indoors (w mild
    AC) so we didn‚Äôt die in the heat. The mini bus system is crazy there! They
    squished at least 50 people in a 16 or-so-seats mini bus. I almost suffocated
    in there. </p>


  

<p>I can probably say that a missions trip to China was very appealing to me
    until I went on this 1-day trip. I don‚Äôt think I can stand having to live
    without toilets for a month or so. Even though at some places, the holes in
    the floor are flushable and are surrounded with ceramic, I‚Äôm just thankful
    that I was paranoid enough to bring a roll of toilet paper w me from Vancouver
    ;P. Well, there‚Äôs always Kleenex packs, but I don‚Äôt like using them. The technique
    of peeing in a hole. Well, anyhow, I envy the guys when it comes to this.
  </p>


  

<p>Friday, August 24, 2001 </p>


  

<p>After spending a very hot night (the AC shut off in the middle of the night)
    trying to sleep on a sofa bed (hard plywood board at the top and soft at bottom),
    my mom, sis and I decided to leave early b/c we couldn‚Äôt stand the heat (yeah,
    I know we‚Äôre wimps/high maintenance). There was a heatstroke warning that
    day anyhow. I don‚Äôt think we would‚Äôve survived if we were to go the ‚ÄúSmall
    World‚Äù park of the miniature wonders/landmarks of the world. </p>


  

<p>Spent the evening at my aunts after s‚Äômore shopping. I bought 2 pairs of
    semi-casual sandals for $10 CDN each (nice but they have heels that are waay
    too high for me-well, at least I can now be at least 2.5 inches taller! :)).
    Boy, is HK so much cooler in comparison to Shenzhen! </p>


  

<p>Saturday, August 25, 2001 </p>


  

<p>This time, my dreams had Peon, Marc, Jon, Dom, and Josh in it. Peon asked
    me a strange question but I can‚Äôt remember what it was exactly or why she
    asked it. </p>


  

<p>In the evening, I met up with Jen Lam at Causeway Bay after a morning of
    shopping at Wan Chai (bought a shoulder bag for a mere $4 CDN) and an afternoon
    of bowling. It was our first time in HK without people taking us around, so
    it was an adventure. I took Jen shoe shopping (because I was there earlier
    in the week when my mom was looking for shoes-the reason why she looks for
    shoes like mad is because she‚Äôs only a size 34 (4-5) and not many stores carry
    that size) and Jen took me to the Hello Kitty Caf√© to eat dinner. It‚Äôs
    a very ‚Äúcute‚Äù caf√©. Everything is Hello Kitty-from the tables/chairs
    to the food itself-the ‚Äúsoy‚Äù meat in the noodles were shaped in
    the face of Hello Kitty. </p>


  

<p>I think if I didn‚Äôt meet up with Jen that day, I wouldn‚Äôt have been able
    to find such good deals in HK b/c we ended up stopping at U2 and we bought
    the same pair of pants ($8 CDN though the price tag said $12CDN/$60 HKD)-except
    she commented that I gained weight b/c she fits a M and I had to take an XL
    b/c they had no more L left and usually, we‚Äôre about the same size in weight
    and height :P. I also grabbed one ¬æ-sleeve long-sleeves for $6 CDN,
    and 2 v-necked T‚Äôs (style like my white one but w/o buttons) for $2.40 CDN
    each. üôÇ I think she bought a T too, cept she chose one size smaller than
    what I had (because I don‚Äôt like it when it shrinks in the dryer). </p>


  

<p>Sunday, August 26, 2001 </p>


  

<p>After church that morning, we decided to see the Whampoa mall, which has
    a very unique architectural design-a cruise ship structure-very interesting,
    especially when you can see it from the harbour. On the StarCruise Leo, we
    were able to see this mall smack in the middle of residential buildings, looking
    as if it was a scene from Speed II. </p>


  

<p>The StarCruise Leo-first time on a cruise. First impression of lobby area:
    woah, this is like a hotel (somehow it reminded me of West Ed Mall)! Each
    ship of the company is named after an astrological star/constellation, but
    my brother made an interesting comment, ‚ÄúWhat about StarCruise Cancer?!‚Äù
    as he noticed that his ‚Äúsign‚Äù was missing from the fleet). During
    that entire day, I felt like I was coming down with something because I felt
    like throwing up because my stomach was quite wheezy-and during the previous
    night, while my sister was warm in her sleep, I was freezing cold. It didn‚Äôt
    help that I still feel the ship move, even in mild weather. </p>


  

<p>During this trip, I developed an interesting theory on why I don‚Äôt like airplanes
    rides. I think it‚Äôs because it‚Äôs constantly rocking/moving, and one‚Äôs enclosed
    in such a tight space. Not to mention that whenever I fall asleep, I‚Äôm half
    self-conscious b/c of where my head goes-if it leans over to the next person,
    if it falls forward, etc. </p>


  

<p>There‚Äôs not too much to do on a cruise ship. Internet access is $8 CDN for
    ¬Ω hr and everything else (such as arcades) require money as well. The
    only thing I did that day was ‚Äúswim‚Äù (or splashed around -that‚Äôs
    more like it), saw a dance/acrobatics stage show (with Vegas showgirls but
    they, thankfully, had clothes on in this session) where in one act, a woman
    used a bow and arrow to shoot an apple off of her own head! Very dangerous
    indeed. </p>


  

<p>Monday, August 27, 2001 </p>


  

<p>Around noon, we arrived at Sayan Hainan Island, China. Our family joined
    a bus tour to a big Buddhist temple. We made a bathroom stop along the way-you
    know, the places where the tour guides and the company has an agreement that
    if we buy into what they are trying to sell us (this time it‚Äôs ‚Äúlian-zhi‚Äù
    leaves), the tour guides get a percentage of commission. The ladies seem to
    be the ones that target you-they try to push you to buy their products like
    crazy. Anyhow, I can‚Äôt believe I went to the bathroom here; I had to endure
    another ‚Äúholy‚Äù one. See, if I knew that the temple actually had
    toilets, I probably would‚Äôve used those instead. Sigh. </p>


  

<p>Sheesh, the roads there are worse than those in Montr√©al-tons of potholes
    that shoot you to the ceiling. I was really tired so I managed to catch a
    wink of sleep because I was extremely tired that day. There was not much to
    see at the temple. However, I did learn that they were starting to build an
    idol/statue that would reach higher than the Statue of Liberty in New York.
    That‚Äôs crazy. Next, they‚Äôll probably repeat the story of the Tower of Babel
    as told in Genesis. The vegetarian meal was done quite well though at the
    local temple restaurant. Much of the texture of the imitation meat (soy) was
    very close and it tasted quite like the flavour of the meat dish. </p>


  

<p>On our way back, the tour bus let us stop to try some ‚Äútea‚Äù-one
    kind of tea they let the group try was made from ‚Äúfoo-gua‚Äù (bitter
    melon). It tasted very interesting. There were other bitter teas that they
    brewed, but after we tried them all, the ladies once again tried to sell them
    to us-I can‚Äôt believe that a can of tea leaves would cost at least $80 CDN!
  </p>


  

<p>By the time we boarded on the ship again, it was around 19:02. I was somewhat
    hungry again, and during dinner, my sister and I ate a 3 course Western meal,
    while my parents and my brother chose the Chinese set menu. According to my
    sister, I apparently ‚Äúeat a lot‚Äù-she said that I used to eat less
    than she did. Well, if that is the case, I‚Äôm grateful for a high metabolism
    rate then, because I haven‚Äôt gained much (if any) for many years now :). </p>


  

<p>After an evening show at the theatre (which included a synchronised light
    and music show, and an elderly lady in the audience energetically following
    the cast dancing to the YMCA onstage-which was mighty impressive), my sis
    and I decided to check out the small casino that was on the ship with my mom
    in tow. As we arrived at the door, the security guards asked us ‚Äúyoung
    ladies‚Äù to step aside (you see, the age of majority is 18 there so my
    sis wanted to take the opportunity to see something like this before she heads
    back to Canada and waits another year). As my mother waited for a cross-reference
    check (asked us for our access cards and called security office) on her kids,
    my sister in a stage-whisper loudly proclaims to me, ‚ÄúBut, you‚Äôre 21!‚Äù
    ‚ÄòTwas quite amusing because I don‚Äôt think the security guard actually believed
    her because he turned to take a glance at me, considering I think he probably
    thought my sister was older than I was-and until the reference confirmed that
    we were of legal age. All he said was, ‚ÄúThank you,‚Äù as we walked
    off smirking. </p>


  

<p>Tuesday, August 28, 2001 </p>


  

<p>This time, my dreams contained Melody C., and Ben C. in them (they are not
    related. Melody is from my high school and Ben is from UW). </p>


  

<p>At 7:30, the ship docks in Danang, Vietnam and we disembark for another tour.
    This time, we joined a bus/walking tour to the local museums and embroidery
    shops/galleries. </p>


  

<p>Impressions of Central Vietnam (first time in Vietnam): </p>


  

<p>Many signs of a developing (poor) country/city. <br>
    Too many motorbikes/cycles/scooters zooming on the roads. <br>
    Driving a bus or any type of vehicle is like playing the arcade game, ‚ÄúCrazy
    Taxi‚Äù. Sitting in the front seat of the bus is very scary. All you see
    is the bus getting so close to these bikes and most of the riders aren‚Äôt even
    wearing proper helmets (and to think that in China, we saw the remains of
    a bike accident w the helmet on the ground and the body gone). <br>
    There are too many people on the streets trying to sell goods to the tourists,
    especially to the foreigners (ie. Non-Asian) because they don‚Äôt know how to
    bargain with their prices/products. They know that it‚Äôs illegal to sell on
    private property, so they loiter around the building until we step onto the
    street, and then they start hounding us again, trying to make us pity them.
    Actually, I was lucky, I didn‚Äôt get bugged even though the rest of my family
    did (including my sister). I have a couple of theories on why: A) I followed
    behind the Australians (so to lose the focus) or B) I don‚Äôt look like I have
    any money on me b/c I still look young. These peddlers are willing to follow
    us around for blocks! <br>
    Food in this part of Vietnam definitely does not compare to pho in Canada.
    Maybe we were not served the best, but the pho and spring rolls are really
    gross compared to the Canadian Vietnamese food. However, dragon fruit has
    a very interesting taste to it. <br>
    At this point, I concluded that I felt fat (for once). All we ever did on
    the cruise was eat, eat, and eat. No time to digest. I remember that towards
    the end, I kept feeling hungry 1 hour after I ate a meal, even though I knew
    that I just ate. Thankfully, I don‚Äôt think I gained any, if much. If I did,
    it‚Äôs only a maximum of 1 lb. (but unfortunately, it would be in the wrong
    areas). </p>


  

<p>Back at the ship, we watched Cast Away, starring Tom Hanks and featuring
    Helen Hunt (I wonder if Dom has this one). I didn‚Äôt like it b/c I almost fell
    asleep-the storyline went a l‚Äôil too slow for my liking, and we had to endure
    1 hour of monologue w/o any musical background. I don‚Äôt understand why they
    chose to feature this film though, due to the fact that we were, afterall,
    on a cruise and the weather was becoming stormy. Well, at least they didn‚Äôt
    show Titanic (although the drills they had at the beginning had life jackets
    much like those on the Titanic). </p>


  

<p>Stormy weather. Not very pleasant on a cruise. I decided to be adventurous
    so I went outside alone, but it wasn‚Äôt a very good move because I almost was
    stuck out there. The winds were so high (not to mention that it was starting
    to rain) that the main doors were steeled shut and the smaller doors were
    soooo hard to pull back open b/c of the air/wind pressure or something. I
    had to pull with all my might. I think it was also around then that I decided
    to go down to the Captain‚Äôs bridge again (pretty much an area where you can
    see the ‚Äúcockpit‚Äù if you were in a plane) to see what it was like
    up front. Guess what? They turned off one of their radars, and they were using
    binoculars to see! I was like, uh-oh, that doesn‚Äôt seem right. There must
    be a lot of fog or something-glad no icebergs got in the way üòõ </p>


  

<p>During the evening, I beat my brother at the arcades (racing a Celica vs.
    NS-X or something and out-cycled my brother on the physical virtual bike race).
    I slept well that night, but most of my family members didn‚Äôt because the
    ship was rocking too heavily. </p>


  

<p>Wednesday, August 29, 2001 </p>


  

<p>Surprisingly, I didn‚Äôt experience sea sickness, but my sister got mildy sick
    and we saw the remnants of someone‚Äôs breakfast on the carpet. </p>


  

<p>This time, we spent another $6 CDN on arcades (that‚Äôs $3 each) and my brother
    beat my choice of car (MR2) and beat me on the bike by 1 second or so. Ah
    well. You win some, you lose some. </p>


  

<p>We docked and disembarked around 16:00. Does it ever feel good to be on land
    again :). Oddly (psychological effects I suppose), on occasions, I still felt
    the floor moving as if I was still at sea. After my first time on a cruise,
    I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll be too overly excited to go on another cruise again. Firstly,
    there‚Äôs not much to do on a ship that cannot be done elsewhere on land (as
    everything isn‚Äôt free), you don‚Äôt get to visit too many exciting places, and
    all you do is eat. I think that because it‚Äôs a Chinese tour group, that it‚Äôs
    also very noisy and rude (especially when they‚Äôre all fighting for buffet
    food). </p>


  

<p>Eew. I don‚Äôt think I will ever dare to drink wine that contains dead, preserved
    baby mice. That‚Äôs what my grandmother has in one of her shelves. Gives me
    the creeps even though I don‚Äôt mind dissecting these rodents. </p>


  

<p>Thursday, August 30, 2001 </p>


  

<p>During the previous evening, it started to really pour in HK. Even the ceilings
    in our apartment started to leak (and annoyed me to death as I was trying
    to sleep and all I could hear was plink-plink into the buckets). </p>


  

<p>I actually spotted the first VW beetle on the roads of HK today. It seems
    like a rare sight for some reason. We spent lunch at this expensive dim sum
    place with my mother‚Äôs church friend from her high school years in HK. He
    happens to be a taxi driver, and the last time we were w him (‚Äô87), my sister
    threw up in his car on the way down/up the Peak b/c she got carsick. </p>


  

<p>36 guests came out to my grandmother‚Äôs 80th birthday celebration. The bill
    came to a close $1720 CDN (works out to be $47 CDN + $4 CDN ‚Äúlai see‚Äù/
    ‚Äúhong bao‚Äù/ red pocket per guest). The cake (from Maxim‚Äôs) itself
    costed $1000 HKD ($200 CDN). What a rip-off, considering there was not much
    fruit-filling in the cake and the texture wasn‚Äôt all that good. I realised
    that wedding banquets must cost a fortune then considering that there is often
    a lot of guests, decorations, hired hands, and food and alcohol consumed.
  </p>


  

<p>That night, my dad killed a cockroach the length of my middle finger (at
    least and much fatter than that as well). Thankfully, that‚Äôs the first one
    I actually saw in the house. </p>


  

<p>Friday, August 31, 2001 </p>


  

<p>Yaay! We were finally returning to Vancouver today (as you can tell, I don‚Äôt
    like HK too much)! During the night, I ended up rolling off the couch and
    was about to hit the floor if my suitcase wasn‚Äôt in the way to block my fall.
    I think I rolled over in my sleep a bit too far b/c I was dreaming that I
    was twirling or something. </p>


  

<p>The plane ride back home was very turbulent. At one point, my stomach was
    doing flip-flops (because I felt like we kept falling), and so I started becoming
    paranoid when I saw the flight attendants actually strapped into theirs seats
    as well; I thought that we were going to die. In my paranoia, I decided to
    pray and ended up thinking of the results if I was to die. Somehow, I asked
    God to give me the opportunity to give me a chance to witness to my friend
    from high school even more. So, I guess I should taken whatever opportunity
    comes to me since we arrived in Vancouver 1 hour early :). </p>


  

<p>That‚Äôs my trip and this has been one long read (incomprehensive at times
    I‚Äôm sure). <br>
    Thanks for staying this far. üôÇ </p>


  

<p>Until next time, <br>
    This is L‚Äôil Miss Bo-Peep signing off.
  </p>
