		<p>				Day One-Wednesday, April 26th, 2000: New York, here I come!
    <br>
    On the night before my flight, I had to wake up at 6:00 a.m. with only 2 hours
    of sleep. One of my friends was kindly willing to wake up during the wee hours
    of the early morning to drive me from Waterloo, Ontario to the airport in
    Mrs. Sauga, Ontario, which took over a l‚Äôil o‚Äôer an hour. </p>


  

<p>My flight was at 10:00 a.m. and by the time we got to the airport, my stomach
    was feeling a l‚Äôil funny. It felt like the time at Winter Conference in Three
    Hills, Alberta, where we stayed up playing poker and I felt so sick on the
    bus ride and on the plane that I was on the verge of throwing up into my friend‚Äôs
    lap (but he didn‚Äôt know that . . . ;P). And also the time when my stomach
    felt funny right before I fainted in front of the washroom door, and then
    embarrassingly in front of Uncle Charles and Uncle Kai (and almost everyone
    of you, came to visit me in Pastor Joel‚Äôs office). This time, I didn‚Äôt even
    finish the apple fritter from Tim Hortons or my 50 cents bottled water from
    Costco, which was supposed to be my breakfast. All I did on the plane was
    sleep, ignoring the muffins and the drinks that they gave out. The plane seating
    arrangement was amazing! I think the plane itself was almost empty. Many weren‚Äôt
    squished at all. I had a whole row to myself-all three seats! I could‚Äôve slept
    horizontally but I didn‚Äôt want to be the l‚Äôil kid that I already am. üôÇ </p>


  

<p>I imagine that the flight was 1 hr and 26 mins long and by the time I got
    there, it was a l‚Äôil past 11:30 a.m. My luggage came onto the carousel quite
    quickly and so did everyone else‚Äôs, and Vonne and her ‚Äúuncle‚Äù(family
    friend), Uncle Peter, were already waiting for me. We drove from La Guardia,
    New York (from hereon termed, NY) to Short Hills, New Jersey (NJ) into a mall
    and ate at Johnny Rocket(s), a place like Mel‚Äôs Diner in Waterloo. Uncle Peter
    treated us. That mall is high class, perfect for HM people (that‚Äôs high maintenance
    for you)! We didn‚Äôt buy a single thing there because all it sold was DKNY,
    Guess, Gucci, Nine West, Jones NY, the list goes on and on. The washrooms
    were even a l‚Äôil too comfortable. Besides being clean, with 2-ply soft toilet
    paper, and softly thick good quality paper towels, there were couches for
    you to sit on (and you know what I discovered? It seems like sour-keys [the
    gummy sour candy] doesn‚Äôt exist in the States. I tried looking all over NY
    and NJ for them but to no avail). </p>


  

<p>OH yeah! I definitely recommend this book, which I found in the mall at Short
    Hills, to Carey (a.k.a. ‚ÄúLiang Chai‚Äù). He is a HS friend of mine
    (don‚Äôt ask me what HS means [and it doesn‚Äôt mean ‚Äòhigh school‚Äô in this context]
    but it definitely applies to him if you know him): The Gas We Pass. I think
    I will buy it from Amazon using my $100 gift certificate (to see the reviews,
    please go to: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0916291529/qid%3D957323133/103-7444639-9361461" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0916291529/qid%3D957323133/103-7444639-9361461</a>).
    Because the reviews are so good, I might also even get Everyone Poops, All
    About Scabs, The Hole in Your Nose, or Breasts . . . </p>


  

<p>At 6:15 p.m., Uncle Peter came and picked us up from the mall (b/c he went
    to work after we had lunch) and we went home to Morristown (keep in mind that
    Vonne‚Äôs uncle‚Äôs place is Morristown and not Moorestown where my relatives
    are). We proceeded to go grocery shopping for our breakfasts, which consisted
    of cranberry-orange muffins, creamcheese and bagel, and of course, Tropicana
    OJ (that‚Äôs orange juice, not OJ Simpson). </p>


  

<p>Dinner was extravagant (in a university student‚Äôs eyes), a seafood dinner
    worth at least $25 Canadian at a local restaurant. Once again, he treated.
    Vonne and I soon realized that a meal with Uncle Peter would cost that much
    and it wasn‚Äôt a big deal for him. I had so much seafood within the 4 days
    in NY! He even was going to treat us to Miss Saigon ($40 USD) but Vonne didn‚Äôt
    let him (that‚Äôs another story for later)J. By the time we got home that night,
    it was quite late so we unpacked and planned for the following day, I watched
    the Simpsons on Fox, and called it a night. </p>


  

<p>Day Two-Thursday, April 27th, 2000: Uptown, NY </p>


  

<p>Yawn, what an early morning. Vonne set her alarm to wake us up at 7:05 a.m.
    instead of 8:35 a.m. by accident. So I ‚Äúopened‚Äù the lamp, thinking
    that it was time for us to get up, and thinking that a light in a dark basement
    would sure wake Vonne up. 5 minutes later, when I turned to look at the clock,
    it said 7:05 a.m., so I woke Vonne up and made her change the alarm to 8:35
    a.m. When it really was 8:35 a.m., we woke up and got ready to catch the train
    to NY. We got out of the house by 9:55 a.m. and practically had to run to
    catch the 10:10 a.m. train. By the time we got there, it just pulled up to
    the station. I think Uncle Peter had forgotten that we weren‚Äôt marathon runners
    like he was, so he didn‚Äôt take into account that we walk relatively slow.
    I‚Äôve never been in a passenger train before, with real conductors and all,
    but I imagine that this was similar to Lower Mainland‚Äôs Westcoast Express
    but less fancy. It cost us $10.25 round trip NJ-NY. It brought us to Penn
    (short for Pennsylvania) Station near Madison Square Garden. From there, we
    walked to the Empire State Building and waited in line for hours. First, to
    buy tickets (the CityPass was for 6 attractions for the price of $32.00, which
    would save us 50% in comparison to purchasing them separately), then to line
    up to go up to the 86th floor and to the 107th floor observation decks. By
    the time we finished, we had spent at least 3 hrs in that building alone.
    My recommendation for future visitors is to go there early, and don‚Äôt go on
    the week of Spring Break (for NY/NJ non-post-secondary students). We took
    a lot of pictures so when we develop them, we‚Äôll tell you more stories. </p>


  

<p>Walking from the Empire State Building to Times Square didn‚Äôt take us too
    long, although there were a number of streets. There were many stores to distract
    us along the way. Especially one in particular, The Disney Store. I spent
    most of my ‚Äúsouvenir(s)‚Äù money in those stores alone J. Times Square
    was bigger than I imagined it to be, with flashy lights and HDTV ads! Vonne
    and I were really good at hiding the fact that we were visitors. We would
    hide in the corner of stores to look at the map and took pictures only in
    tourist attractions, rarely, if ever, on the streets. After a lunch at McDonald‚Äôs,
    we discovered precious treasure! </p>


  

<p>The visitor‚Äôs information center in Times Square had a YAHOO! Internet terminal.
    There was actually a line-up for people to surf the net, and to check e-mail
    on 5 terminals. The sixth terminal took your photo and sent it to the e-mail
    address that you specified. Both Vonne and I now think that it‚Äôs a gimmick,
    because we had sent two, both on separate days, and nothing has arrived in
    our inboxes since. We hypothesize that they just want your e-mail addresses
    to add to their mass ‚Äújunk‚Äù e-mail list. We are both very disappointed
    üôÅ . </p>


  

<p>After spending enough time doing our e-mailing and photo-taking, we decided
    to saunter off to Rockefeller Plaza. My sister‚Äôs friend wanted a Conan O‚ÄôBrien
    cap, so we decided to go wander around the NBC store to try and find a clean
    cap for him. Well, there wasn‚Äôt one, but I bought it anyway, considering he
    really wanted it, and it wasn‚Äôt my money anyway :). On our way, we passed
    St. Patrick‚Äôs Cathedral, a big Catholic church where they allow visitors to
    go in, make a candle offering, pray, or even take pictures and tour the building.
    We have some pictures of that too. What I noticed however, was that Catholics
    don‚Äôt remind me of Protestant/Evangelical Christians (what Vonne and I are)
    at all. They have so many statues and pictures and stuff to pray to and make
    candle offerings to, that it doesn‚Äôt make any sense, which saddens me. </p>


  

<p>By the time we were done, we had to catch the train back to NJ. So we walked,
    no, ran back to Penn Station (because we kind of walked too slowly in the
    beginning). We had plenty of exercise for the day. Dinner? Well, it was kind
    of with the late lunch we had, but we bought a Cajun chicken burger at McDonald‚Äôs
    for $1 each and ate it at home, along with some ice cream, chips, Tropicana,
    and mango. We planned for Friday, and went to bed. </p>


  

<p>Day Three-Friday, April 28th, 2000: Downtown, NY </p>


  

<p>We woke up earlier than the last so we could catch the train from Summit?/Harrison?,
    NJ to the ferry in Hoboken?/Newark?, NJ. Maybe Vonne would remember, because
    I think she still has the maps. Thankfully, we decided to take the train to
    the ferry instead of to Penn Station like the previous day, because there
    was a derailment that morning, and all trains went to the ferry terminal anyway.
    If we were to go uptown from the ferry point the previous day, we‚Äôd be completely
    lost. I think that God kept a close watch over us, and gave us everything
    to our advantage including sunshine. Apparently, there hasn‚Äôt been a sunny
    weekend (and following week) in 6 weeks J! The 1-way trip on the train costed
    us $5.00 and the ferry was $2.00. We ended up being very lost at first because
    we forgot the map at home L, but thankfully, we managed to pick up a map of
    the financial district on our accidental tour of the New York Stock Exchange.
  </p>


  

<p>The NY Stock Exchange was crazy. I haven‚Äôt seen anything like it. I wish
    that we had time to sneak a peek at Nasdaq (as RIMM has kept my interest in
    stocks recently). At the NY Stock Exchange, one was only allowed to view 2
    floors-the natural gas and the gold/silver trading. Going in, we had no idea
    what was happening. We could hear them even though we were viewing behind
    a glass. They all looked like l‚Äôil boys screaming and yelling at each other.
    Yep, we didn‚Äôt see any women there at all. But that doesn‚Äôt mean that there
    aren‚Äôt any doing that as their occupation; they‚Äôre just the minority. These
    people were circling pits and giving hand signals (wave in means buy, and
    wave out means sell) and trying to communicate to each other. It‚Äôs all a matter
    of eye contact and mutual agreement. I would never want to do this! Too aggressive
    and too stressful for me. </p>


  

<p>Heh-heh, we went to Barnes & Noble, an American bookstore, much like
    Chapters (and yes, Chapters is Canadian because I haven‚Äôt seen one in the
    States yet, although I haven‚Äôt seen Indigo yet either). The reason? To look
    at the map to Uptown, NY, mainly to Chinatown. We memorized the streets that
    we should turn at J. Chinatown in NY is big, but there isn‚Äôt much to do there
    unless you want to buy some fruits and veggies and such. Apparently, it‚Äôs
    one of the dirtiest Chinatowns around but I guess that since I‚Äôm so used to
    the streets of HK, the streets didn‚Äôt really appall me. However, the smells
    did remind me of HK. But then again, certain parts of Uptown, NY did too.
  </p>


  

<p>We met up with Vonne‚Äôs high-school friend Stella and her boyfriend, Michael
    (?) for lunch in a caf√© in Chinatown. The red-bean ice was really good
    because the ice was actually crushed! Vonne and I were once again treated
    for lunch, this time by Stella‚Äôs boyfriend (you know what? We realized that
    if we had paid for all our meals, we would had gone over our budget long before
    our departure home. In fact, Vonne had budgeted just enough to take the shuttle
    bus to JFK airport from Newark. We were quite fortunate! God really took care
    of us and blessed us on this trip! :). </p>


  

<p>Those two ended up taking us to SoHo (meaning South of Houston-a street),
    an artsy, cultural community (supposedly), but we didn‚Äôt see too much there
    except for this one paper shop. This particular store sold everything paper:
    paper by the sheet, even by the pound. Mind you, this isn‚Äôt ordinary recycled
    or laser copying paper, there was so much selection of colours, weight, size,
    and texture of the paper, that the choices were endless. The stuff that I
    was looking for in order to do the grad invitations for CCF were all here.
    Unfortunately, most of the papers were quite expensive K. Ah, oh well, the
    invitations were done well with what we had, and with the assistance of Vonne
    anyway J. </p>


  

<p>We were going to take the subway uptown again, but we decided to just walk
    around downtown in case we had to rush to catch the train again. So we ventured
    into another cathedral (I think it was called Trinity Cathedral) that looked
    similar than St. Paddy‚Äôs (as Uncle Peter likes to call it). We also found
    a store that Stella and her boyfriend recommended called Century 21 (no, it‚Äôs
    not the real estate company). It‚Äôs a department store that sells all brand-name
    stuff at a discounted price. Stella said that we wouldn‚Äôt buy anything, but
    Michael (?) guessed that we would. Well, I was going to by a Pierre Cardin
    ($7 USD) leather wallet for my brother, but I didn‚Äôt afterall because I wasn‚Äôt
    sure if he‚Äôd like it or not. But, Vonne after much deliberation, bought a
    Hush Puppies wallet for her mother (so nice of her :)!). However, we ended
    up running to catch the PATH train ($1 USD-isn‚Äôt the fare more than quite
    reasonable?) back to NJ to meet up with Uncle Peter for dinner. We somehow
    seemed to have walked past the World Trade Center to Battery Park until we
    realized that we missed a turn. On top of that, we hadn‚Äôt taken a PATH train
    yet, so we had to run to find where to go down to take the train and which
    track it left on. Thankfully, we made it on time! J </p>


  

<p>Dinner was in Newark at a Spanish restaurant. We ate dinner with Uncle Peter
    and his older sister, Auntie Betty, and her husband, Uncle Bob (?). More seafood
    for yet another evening, but this time, I was rather cautious about eating
    the Atlantic lobster. In Waterloo, I had broken out into a rash due to a still
    unknown reason, and I had thought that perhaps it may have been the Atlantic
    lobster from Red Lobster the night before. Vonne and I split a HUGE marina
    meal that we didn‚Äôt finish. It had clam, mussels (many!), shrimp, scallops,
    and a small lobster tail. That was close to $20.00 USD and I was already feeling
    bad for eating such a big meal. The adults had lobster meals worth $25+ USD.
    Auntie Betty and Uncle Bob(by?) treated us thankfully, or else I would be
    heartbroken over a meal worth $20 that I would have to pay for. But then again,
    we split it so it was only around $10. </p>


  

<p>That evening, we tried rushing to the top of the World Trade Center in NY
    (oh yeah, I can‚Äôt believe that they charge you $4.50 USD for the toll to NY
    from NJ every time!) but it was already closed. That‚Äôs okay though because
    we were going to L‚Äôil Italy anyway (a l‚Äôil ways from Chinatown) to eat dessert.
    Vonne had strawberry shortcake and I had a raspberry cheesecake and Uncle
    Peter had a very tasteful Italian dessert. Once again, he treated. It was
    quite late by the time we got home, so we went to bed to rest up for yet another
    day. </p>


  

<p>Day Four-Saturday, April 29th, 2000: Museums and Miss Saigon </p>


  

<p>The day with Uncle Peter. First, we went to Times Square, NY to buy discounted
    matinee tickets. Actually, Uncle Peter stood in line, and he let us wander
    around. What we ended up doing was going back to the visitor‚Äôs information
    centre to send another e-photo. However, we still haven‚Äôt received anything
    from YAHOO! or from Burger King yet (that‚Äôs the story for Sunday)-I think
    that I should e-mail YAHOO! and ask them if I don‚Äôt see anything soon. Uncle
    Peter ended up waiting for us because the line went through very quickly.
    He got us seats close to each other (Vonne and I were next to each other,
    and Uncle Peter ended up moving next to us after the intermission because
    there was nobody beside Vonne) in the Orchestra section for a mere $40 USD
    (50% off original price). </p>


  

<p>Hmm, I think that it was about time for lunch, so Vonne and I shared 8 pieces
    of Popeye‚Äôs fried chicken and we were so full that we had to ask Uncle Peter
    to finish one piece for us, and Vonne didn‚Äôt even finish her extra side of
    potatoes. Ah, oh well J. 2:00 p.m. was the showing for Miss Saigon, so we
    went to watch our very first musical/Broadway show (except Uncle Peter, whose
    first one was Chorus Line). The show was quite good. I think I wouldn‚Äôt mind
    spending some more money for future shows. </p>


  

<p>After 2 hrs and ¬Ω of the Broadway show, we tried to find LOAW Schwarz
    . . . (or something like that). Apparently, it‚Äôs supposedly the world‚Äôs largest
    toy store-the idea in Toy Story 2, and the store in Home Alone (1 or 2 I forget
    which). On the way, another Disney Store kind of distracted us. Inside, there
    were more souvenirs to buy, and more sales than the previous store (the goods
    of the sale were all gone the following day, when Vonne wanted to buy other
    stuff at the same store, so we were at the right place at the right time).
  </p>


  

<p>We proceeded to walk through Central Park (also featured in one of the Home
    Alone‚Äôs when he finds the pigeon lady) to go to the Metropolitan Museum of
    Art. This museum is huge and quite interesting, but I think I enjoyed the
    Intrepid or the Museum of Natural History more (which is a story for the following
    day). There wasn‚Äôt much time after we wandered through the museum, so we quickly
    tried to catch a cab to the World Trade Center so that we could view the city
    during the night. We only had approximately 15 mins by the time we got up
    there, so we were in quite a rush. Thus, we missed the stimulated helicopter
    ride (whatever that was) of NY and we missed some photo opportunities in the
    WTC. </p>


  

<p>We took the PATH train back to Harrison, where we parked in the morning.
    Funny, that morning, we inserted only 3 hrs and 45 mins worth of quarters
    (which gives you 15 mins per quarter) in the meters, when we should have paid
    for 7 hrs. We decided to risk the approximate 4 hrs until we saw that many
    tickets were issued to cars that had meters expired along the way (Vonne‚Äôs
    uncle lost some confidence in the risk). We then discovered that one could
    park all day for $3.00 close-by, so we gave up 3 hrs and 45 mins (and perhaps
    even a parking ticket) to park all day :). That night, we ended up having
    thin-crust pizza at home for dinner. </p>


  

<p>Day Five-Sunday, April 30th, 2000: Last day in NY! </p>


  

<p>Uncle Peter drove us to the pier where the Harbor Cruiseline left. Yep, we
    took a 2-hr cruise (from 11:30 a.m.) of NY Island. On the way, we passed the
    Statue of Liberty, many of NY‚Äôs bridges, and the skyline of NY, which included
    the Empire State Building, the Chrysler Building, the Financial District,
    etc. We took many pictures, which we hope will turn out quite nicely :). </p>


  

<p>After docking, we went next door to the Intrepid museum, which is a retired
    aircraft carrier that fought in 2 wars, including WWII (because a couple of
    the ship crew are working there now), which survived bombed injuries. Aboard
    that ship was a very sleek US spy plane and beside it was the only missile-guided
    submarine that visitors were allowed to tour. However, because the line up
    was so long (first it was 50 mins, then it was 1 hr and 15 mins), we decided
    to pass up the opportunity. Too bad L. Sometimes, I wonder why Canada doesn‚Äôt
    have more of these. It‚Äôs so fun to climb aboard a war ship! In my lifetime,
    the only ones I‚Äôve been on is in the States; I‚Äôve seen one docked by Westminster
    Quay, BC, but I don‚Äôt even know if they open that one up for visitors. We
    took many pictures too-silly ones. Unfortunately, the spy plane was at a bad
    angle so we couldn‚Äôt get a picture of it. </p>


  

<p>We rushed to the next museum via subway. But we made a detour on the way.
    Burger King for lunch with one slight distraction. An e-video and Internet
    terminal! Woo-hoo :)! So after checking our e-mails, we took 2 e-videos and
    sent them out. Once again, they haven‚Äôt arrived in our inboxes yet, so I think
    I will e-mail Adobe soon to complain. Due to our stop, we were late in arriving
    at the Museum of Natural History so we got in for free and ran around for
    ¬Ω hr prior to closing to take as many pics as possible J. In an amazing
    amount of time, we went through 4 floors of displays and managed to get a
    general glimpse of the museum. </p>


  

<p>The subway station was right beside the Museum of Natural History, so we
    took the subway to the Museum of Modern Art, but by the time we got there,
    ‚Äôtwas closed. It closes on 5:45 p.m. on Sundays, you see. Ah, oh well. We
    went to the Disney Store instead, and on the way back, we passed by some stores
    to pick up more postcards and to see if we could find Vonne a Miss Saigon
    souvenir. Well, she almost bought a T-shirt. </p>


  

<p>Notice that I said ‚Äúalmost‚Äù. Why? Well, because we got scared.
    We casually ventured inside a boutique, and all of a sudden, we heard screams
    and shouts, and then what looked like the beginnings of a fist-fight right
    outside the store. Even the store manager, an elderly Chinese lady went out
    to try and break it up, so we knew that it involved the store. We couldn‚Äôt
    go anywhere, because 2 other ladies were blocking the only exit. So, me, having
    watched too many movies and read too many books, pulled Vonne behind the pillar
    in case anyone started shooting. Silly me J. Well, anyway, Vonne saw an opportunity
    to escape out of the store when the 2 ladies escaped in a hurry. So we all
    rushed out the store and the ladies said that as much as they wanted the shawl,
    they were not going back there to get it. And as much as we wanted to buy
    the T-shirt, we were not going back there either üôÅ . </p>


  

<p>Anyway, all that commotion and searching for a Miss Saigon shirt made us
    almost late for the train again, so we practically sprinted to the subway
    station (well, speed-walked) and connected to the PATH train, just as it was
    arriving. Dinner? Er, I forget what we had. I think it was a mixture of lunch
    and the food we ate at home. Oh yeah! Vonne was hungry, so we dug out some
    microwaveable frozen pasta (which looked like airplane food but tasted much
    better) from Uncle Peter‚Äôs freezer. That night, we ended up watching a very
    old episode of Friends before packing our luggage and going to sleep (which
    was very late relative to our vacation schedule-past 2:00 a.m.). </p>


  

<p>Day Six-Monday, May 01st , 2000 to Day Twelve-Sunday, May 07th, 2000: NJ!
  </p>


  

<p>Arrived in Moorestown, NJ late morning. Had buffet lunch. Shopped at Christian
    bookstore. Every day thereafter: </p>


  

<p>¬∑ Shopping (everywhere including craft stores) <br>
    ¬∑ Eating (including a meal at Red Lobster [my second time there in
    my life!] on Friday, May 05th, 2000-yummy, more seafood!) <br>
    ¬∑ Sleeping <br>
    ¬∑ Reading (Phillip Yancey‚Äôs: What‚Äôs So Amazing About Grace; The Bible
    Jesus Read-both very good books!) <br>
    ¬∑ Beading (my new hobby J) <br>
    ¬∑ Playing (piano, with cousins, etc.) <br>
    ¬∑ E-mailing/writing my journal (the copy you see here) <br>
    ¬∑ Relaxing </p>


  

<p>Key Highlight(s): Thursday, May 04th, 2000: ILOVEYOU virus breaks out, and
    many people I know get infected. For additional details of this virus, please
    refer to: <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/sections/tech/DailyNews/virus_000505.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://abcnews.go.com/sections/tech/DailyNews/virus_000505.html</a>
  </p>


  

<p>The End. </p>


  

<p>P.S. Thanks for your patience and time in reading this long (and probably
    boring report) of my trip. Hope you enjoyed at least 0.0001% of it :P!</p>
