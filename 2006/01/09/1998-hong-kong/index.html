		<p>				Note to my friends who have been praying for me during my
    trip in Hong Kong: THANKS üôÇ </p>


  

<p>Day One: Monday, August 10, 1998 (Pacific Standard Time); Tuesday, August
    11, 1998 (Hong Kong Time Zone)<br>
    8:45 am: Becky Chan telephones my sister to say good-bye to her before she
    leaves for work. That is my wake-up call. 5 minutes later, my sister comes
    into my room to tell me to wake up and get ready to leave as my father had
    relayed the message to Sheila in the middle of Becky‚Äôs call. That‚Äôs what BC
    Tel‚Äôs call waiting is for I guess. </p>


  

<p>I don‚Äôt remember when we arrived at the airport but we got there safely.
    Pastor Joshua accompanied us as he was going to take our van back to our house
    for us. After we had checked-in with Air Canada, we had time for some lunch
    as we knew the plane food wasn‚Äôt going to be that pleasant. My family had
    Burger King and some Fortune Wok (or some kind of Wok food) . . .I on the
    other hand couldn‚Äôt eat anything but an apple because ever since Saturday,
    I had encountered a stomach virus (accompanied by a fever) and whenever I
    ate, the food didn‚Äôt stay in my digestive tract for very long (not that you
    wanted to know). I shall spare you the details, but let‚Äôs just say that I‚Äôm
    thankful that I didn‚Äôt vomit because I hate vomiting. </p>


  

<p>The A343 plane lifted-off approximately at 1:00 p.m. I barely got a chance
    to sleep on the plane. I had prayed beforehand that my stomach would last
    until I got off the plane and God answered another prayer! When I was completely
    healed was another thing, another day. Perhaps that was why my appetite wasn‚Äôt
    that big (it was God‚Äôs doing)‚ÄìI only had 8 slices (or pieces) of Premium
    Plus crackers and hot water as I couldn‚Äôt eat any of the plane food (thank
    goodness, though the sushi sure looked good). I didn‚Äôt even have enough appetite
    to eat the apple that we bought at the airport last minute that totaled to
    (all currency is in Canadian) $1.00. </p>


  

<p>13 hours and 22 minutes. What a long plane ride, but to pass much of the
    time, they showed some TV sitcoms: Seinfield, Spin City, some documentary
    on American lobsters, CBC News, some music videos, and 4 movies (Aerovision
    Movie Presentations): The Lucky Guy (some Chinese movie), Sliding Doors, Wag
    The Dog (I thought that Wag the Dog was about a dog, not politics!), and The
    Real Howard Spitz. They weren‚Äôt supposed to show The Real Howard Spitz but
    I guess they had too much time on their hands. They had music to listen to
    as well, and my sister found a Christian Contemporary and Gospel music station
    with songs from Avalon, DC Talk, Amy Grant, Michael W. Smith, Jars of Clay,
    and other artists I haven‚Äôt heard of‚Äìthey were the gospel songs. </p>


  

<p>The Hong Kong International airport was a big place! They had electronic/computerized
    trains that ran from one part of the airport to the other (probably because
    it would‚Äôve taken too long to walk from one end to the other. However there
    were many things that were still in the process of repair/construction (e.g.
    a moving sidewalk). I also wanted to find the places where they had shiny
    marbled floor tiles that when one looked down, (s)he could see the reflection
    of people walking. If someone was wearing a skirt, one could‚Äôve seen beneath
    it. I didn‚Äôt come across one then, but on the way back I inspected it and
    I could see my reflection quite clearly. Thank goodness that I wasn‚Äôt wearing
    a skirt, just jeans. </p>


  

<p>It took us 1.5 hours to get home in traffic. We could‚Äôve taken a taxi that
    would‚Äôve come to $60-$80 or an electric train and then transferred to the
    MTR (subway transit) but that was too inconvenient. The double decker bus
    fare for the family was $30. </p>


  

<p>After we arrived, our grandfather (you see only he was there because my aunt
    and her kids went to China and my grandmother and my uncles were in Guam)
    took us out to dinner but all I had was plain rice because I still couldn‚Äôt
    eat properly (yum). By the time we got home, it was nearly 10 p.m. but even
    though it‚Äôs not that late, we were all really tired so we went to bed really
    soon. </p>


  

<p>
    Day Two: Wednesday, August 12, 1998 (Hong Kong Time Zone)<br>
    6:59 am: Pitter-patter . . .drip, drip, drip . . .the pouring rain woke me
    up so I got up to adjust the air-conditioner. My brother also woke up so we
    turned on the television to see if there were any Chinese cartoons on. However,
    the only program that kept coming on was the morning news, which kept rerunning
    even up to 8:30 am when we went to wash-up and have breakfast. </p>


  

<p>Because everyone woke up so early, we decided to go out and walk around to
    see if there were any shops nearby that were open. You wouldn‚Äôt believe it
    if I told you that none of the shops open until 10:30 am at the earliest (but
    they close at 9:30 p.m. or later every night)! We had dim sum at 3 p.m. because
    we had to clean our apartment (it was just newly renovated). We then proceeded
    into probably one of the largest HMVs in Hong Kong (and perhaps the world).
    It had four stories with different types of music located on each floor. At
    the time, there was a ‚Äúcrazy sale‚Äù so we decided to look to see
    if there were any CDs that were by contemporary Christian artists. Since there
    was no alphabetical order of the artists names in the sale racks, we had to
    spend quite a bit of time flipping through each CD before coming across the
    Newsboys single, ‚ÄòTake Me To Your Leader‚Äô and Steven Curtis Chapman‚Äôs, ‚ÄòSigns
    of Life‚Äô (I think my brother found both of them). My sister purchased the
    Newsboys CD that had 5 songs on it including the ‚ÄòShine‚Äô remix ($2) and I
    purchased the Steven Curtis Champman one ($10). </p>


  

<p>In the afternoon, we got a chance to watch a Chinese cartoon ‚ÄòDing Dong‚Äô
    or otherwise known as ‚ÄòDoramoen‚Äô (spelling?). . . I think it was until our
    aunt invited us to dinner in Hong Kong Island (we live in Tsim Sha Tsui, Kowloon).
    We took the Star Ferry across the ocean/sea (?) and had dinner (which I decided
    to take a chance and eat real food‚Äìbig mistake). Their apartment is considered
    to be one of the ‚Äúwell-off‚Äù luxurious ones. It had 4 bedrooms, 2
    bathrooms including full bathtubs and showers with gas-heated hot water tanks,
    1 big storage area/closet, a huge dining table, leather couches, cabled TV
    (my grandparents don‚Äôt own these you see), and a DVD/karoake machine (and
    I forgot also a hired maid). They even are members of certain clubs (you know,
    places where you may use the facilities for approximately $1000 a year). That
    night, the three of us (kids) got a chance to stay overnight and I finally
    decided to suffer and take this disgusting bitter tasting Chinese medicine
    (which contains 50% alcohol, metholaumem, distilled water, cloves, nutmeg,
    and other ingredients) in hopes of ridding that awful reaction I got after
    eating (well, I think it must‚Äôve worked because I was pretty much okay the
    following day). </p>


  

<p>
    Day Three: Thursday, August 13, 1998 (Hong Kong Time Zone)<br>
    Um, yeah so I was going on and on about what happened but my screen froze
    and I had to start all over again (from Day 3 to Day 4) and at the same time
    I am watching The Devil‚Äôs Advocate so I am really distracted. Anyway, I seemed
    to have misplaced my notes until the end of summer and it was not until now
    (December 19, 1998) that I am finishing my journal. So that morning, I woke
    up at 10 am to the noise of the kids talking. I spent most of my time being
    bored that day because my cousins had a private tutor over. However, we got
    a chance to go to the stationary store nearby and I got a chance to buy some
    signo milky pens for a good price. That night, we went back across the harbour
    (via the Star Ferry) and went to a restaurant to eat dinner with my mother‚Äôs
    relatives. My, were the dishes ever small!!!!! Never seen such like them!
  </p>


  

<p>
    Day Four: Friday, August 14, 1998 (Hong Kong Time Zone)<br>
    After breakfast that morning, our family decided to go the science centre
    except it was closed. You see, we have a family membership at Science World
    and so there is free admission to other science centres around the world.
    Because the science centre was still closed, we walked around for awhile.
    My sister, being Sheila, who loves to shop (unlike myself), bought many clothes
    while I just bought a purse (a purse? I thought it was stickers!) Anyway,
    we went to the most non-Chinese place in the world for lunch: McDonald‚Äôs.
    However, the iced lemon tea in the McDonald‚Äôs are only found in Hong Kong
    (well not here anyway). A McCrunch was the latest trend (some pork burger)
    so that is what I had. We proceeded to go to Tom Lee and we ended up buying
    the latest hits music for the piano, flute, trumpet except the music were
    not all in the same key which I didn‚Äôt know then ~ oh well. We finally went
    back to the science centre and quickly looked around-4 floors and I‚Äôm sure
    some of you know that already since I was there in 1993-and went home for
    the night. </p>


  

<p>
    Day Five: Saturday, August 15, 1998 (Hong Kong Time Zone)<br>
    The adults had a meeting so the kids were stuck downstairs in a room drawing
    and reading and stuff. Wasn‚Äôt my idea of fun but for dim sum, we were able
    to pick what kind of food we wanted =) and so it was good for once! More shopping
    afterwards. Again. The dinner that night was great. Well, it was hilarious.
    We got stuck with some other kids that were staying with my father‚Äôs relatives
    at our own table. They were so annoying at first and they wouldn‚Äôt talk to
    us. Anyway, after one kid threw a napkin and hit a man in the face (sitting
    next to our table), he cried. I didn‚Äôt feel sorry for him even though the
    man got so angry. I thought he deserved it. Apparently, my cousin did and
    she went and tried to cheer him up. Soon enough, he was laughing tears if
    you know what I mean. And once again, they didn‚Äôt believe I was 18. Seriously,
    who does?! One of the girls on my floor when they saw me thought that I was
    16-yeah a genius. I wish. After our very interesting evening, we went home
    and since it was my third uncle‚Äôs birthday, we served him cake. That night
    I think I went to bed early because the next day we had Sunday service at
    8:30 am at the Tsim Sha Tsui Baptist Church which I went to 5 years ago too.
  </p>


  

<p>
    Day Six: Sunday, August 16, 1998 (Hong Kong Time Zone)<br>
    English service with organ worship and hymns except for Majesty is very different.
    The chairperson doing the announcements was Caucasian but yet it was so impressive
    cuz he was translating from a Chinese printed bulletin! Mom, Sheila and I
    met up with my fourth aunt (the same one who has such a luxurious house) and
    went shopping some more. I finally had a chance to drink some bubble tea ~
    mmmmmmm . . .it‚Äôs so good! Is it only this good in Hong Kong?! Anyway, did
    I ever mention that Hong Kong has this really crazed fad with Hello Kitty?
    It was really annoying. And I tried some ‚Äústinky‚Äù tofu-it‚Äôs not
    as great as what everyone says it is. It‚Äôs kinda sour tasting. Oh, we also
    went to buy some shoes for me. The salespeople all thought that I was not
    more than 14. One of them didn‚Äôt believe that even though my mother told him.
    Sheesh. So I ended up buying (or my mother ended up buying for me) shoes,
    jacket, and I bought a $5 nice T, some more pens. How come I don‚Äôt remember
    eating at a Thai cuisine for dinner? Oh well, if my notes say so then I guess
    that is what we did. And we took the ever so expensive but-not-as-expensive-as-Vancouver-I-don‚Äôt-think
    taxi home. </p>


  

<p>
    Day Seven: Monday, August 17, 1998 (Hong Kong Time Zone)<br>
    This Monday was a very special day for Hong Kong because it was supposedly
    the date that China chased Japan outta their country or something. Anyway,
    we woke up at 7:30 am because the family was going to meet my mother‚Äôs friend
    for an early dim sum. Apparently, that friend and his wife were going to see
    a movie afterwards, but I forgot which one it was. So we left them alone and
    our aunt came and took us shopping to help my mother buy a dress for the banquet.
  </p>


  

<p>As the time neared 3:00 p.m. I think (you see both my watches were out-of-order
    so I really have no sense of time), we decided to go to my aunt‚Äôs club for
    lunch. I thought since it was a club, the food would be pretty good so I decided
    to try a shepherd‚Äôs pie. Bad mistake! The pie was quite unappealing because
    it had so much spaghetti-kind meat in it but the orange juice sure tasted
    yummy! </p>


  

<p>In the late afternoon, we went home and the 3 girls (Sheila, Iris, and I)
    spent the rest of the afternoon picking out jewelry from my grandmother as
    she was very generous in giving away the jewelry she still had from the jewelry
    store they own previously. Dinner rolled by again but this time, we had to
    take the MTR (subway) to Mong Kok (but they pronounce it Wong Kok so I still
    haveta figure that one out). </p>


  

<p>That evening, the cousins all decided to practice the El Shaddai piece without
    the cassette player for awhile and one of the younger cousins also decided
    to incorporate a VBS song as well. However, since the cassette player wasn‚Äôt
    bought yet, he was going to teach it to us the following day. </p>


  

<p>At last!!! The hot water tank was finally working (the construction people
    were working at finishing the rest of the house during the day) so I was able
    to take a nice warm shower instead of in freezing (not quite but close to)
    water! =) And the ZZZZ!s came upon me. </p>


  

<p>
    Day Eight: Tuesday, August 18, 1998 (Hong Kong Time Zone)<br>
    Woke up. (duh). Sat around doing nothing after breakfast. Went to lunch with
    my ‚Äúdai‚Äù aunt‚Äôs mother and father. Our family then went to a Chinese
    Christian bookstore. I was going to buy some Chinese memory verse cards that
    were relatively easy to read/understand but they were sold out and thus, I
    didn‚Äôt make a purchase at all. We went to a China store (i.e. a store with
    stuff from China not made out of China) and I think my mother bought a pair
    of shoes there. Formal family pictures were taken at a studio far away. I
    am not patient at those things, they are too picky and they take waay too
    many pictures. By the time we got there, I was all sticky even though I just
    took a shower before leaving the house. Dinner was at 9 p.m. (grrr so hungry
    by then). Dry thunderstorm afterwards . . .and that was the interesting evening.
  </p>


  

<p>
    Day Nine: Wednesday, August 19, 1998 (Hong Kong Time Zone)<br>
    Yawn!!!!!!! We woke up early ‚Äî but don‚Äôt ask me why we did that because I
    had forgotten that the science museum didn‚Äôt open until 1:00 p.m. and the
    art museum‚Äìwho knows when that opened! Well, it‚Äôs kinda neat though because
    on Wednesdays, both museums are free! It was our grandparents‚Äô 60th wedding
    anniversary so after breakfast, we practiced our performance songs: Oh God
    Loves You And Me and El Shaddai. Anyway that is to explain later. The art
    museum was very interesting and uninteresting at the same time. I don‚Äôt understand
    why they charge people money though, it‚Äôs not worth it and I wouldn‚Äôt go if
    I had to pay. The funny thing is at the gift shop they sell CDs that are supposed
    to be therapeutical such as a constipation-reliever. That is true! I am not
    lying! </p>


  

<p>Went to the restaurant early to practice our songs. My sister sang like never
    before and of course I was nothing in comparison (we both had solos for El
    Shaddai). During the banquet, the kids had our own table and my grandfather
    gave such a long speech in Chinese that I think everyone eventually got bored.
    Because it was the last night before my cousins were to leave, they came over
    and had a sleepover. </p>


  

<p>
    Day Ten: Wednesday, August 20, 1998 (Hong Kong Time Zone)<br>
    At 9 am we had to get up and ‚Äúsend‚Äù our cousins and their parents
    off. We shopped and we went to a music studio cuz my father‚Äôs uncle or something,
    wanted to give a violin to my brother because we were looking for one and
    he happened to overhear and so he offered one as a gift. Had dim sum with
    them and got to hear more interesting stories of his childhood. He is a very
    good storyteller. Shopped some more. Wow, so what else is new? </p>


  

<p>That is all I have down on paper, I think we left the day after. The End.
    Phew. <br>
    PS. Watched Titanic on the way back (on the plane) they had sensibly cut out
    the inappropriate parts. <br></p>
