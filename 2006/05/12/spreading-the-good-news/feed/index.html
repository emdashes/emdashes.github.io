					<description><![CDATA[I share your thoughts on &quot;how come I&#039;m not as enthusiastic about sharing salvation in Christ, as I am about a sale at store XYZ?&quot;
point 1:
I think they&#039;ll be more interested in sale, than salvation
point 2:
Telling them about a sale, doesn&#039;t hurt me if they ignore it, as much as them ignoring what I believe in.
point 3:
How good a sale is, is very easy to justify and discuss, without taking it personally.
point 4: and perhaps most importantly.
sense of urgency.
sales end, opportunities are lost.
do we view salvation as a &quot;sale that will end&quot; before we can get in on the deal?
do we feel that Christ is coming soon?  and thus have a sense of urgency?
gradually, this thinking has been changing; and I&#039;m trying to maximize the more subtle opportunities. I am not one to be a streetcorner soapbox or carrying a sandwich board proclaiming &quot;the end is nigh! repent and be saved by faith!&quot;; but I will be up unti 4 AM chatting with you, if you&#039;re ready/willing to hear.]]></description>
