					<description><![CDATA[hmm..
is it perhaps trying to say that Naomi didn&#039;t believe that these daughters were saved, and thus a) shouldn&#039;t return with her? b) God wouldn&#039;t provide for them?
false:
a) practicality, she had no more sons who could provide for them.  they stood a better chance returning home and remarrying, than to GO to a foreign land with a widow and try to remarry. (who wants to marry a widow and a foreigner? xenophobia!)
b) can&#039;t be, she&#039;s praying for God&#039;s blessings on them, that they may remarry in their homeland, that He show kindness to them as they have to her.
