					<description><![CDATA[My dreams either have my teeth falling out one at a time, shattering, or more often, feeling like they are growing painfully (that&#039;s the weird one).  In those dreams, I feel like I&#039;m opening my mouth as wide as I can (not actually happening), and the teeth are growing longer, and the sound is like that squeeky sound you get when you grind ice-cubes between your teeth really slowly.  crreeeeeeek!
But like I said, ever since I went to the dentist to get my bite adjusted, and started wearing a night guard, I haven&#039;t had any of those dreams.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[what kind of tooth dreams do you have? in mine, they (usually back teeth) become really loose and fall out in pieces.
the only reason i thought i had these dreams was because i lost a baby tooth (front) gradually (a piece at different times instead of a complete tooth) as a child.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I get &quot;shattering teeth&quot; dreams all the time.  I&#039;m assuming that&#039;s what you are describing by saying that your last tooth is coming apart.  It&#039;s caused by grinding your teeth in your sleep--you can exert much more force when you are asleep than you ever could awake.  Getting a night guard from your dentist will make it go away.
