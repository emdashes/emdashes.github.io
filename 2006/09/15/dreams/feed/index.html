					<description><![CDATA[hypnic jerk = myoclonic twitch.
I prefer jw&#039;s explanation of falling. the person who told me about it said it&#039;s b/c as your metabolism slows down for sleep, your body thinks it&#039;s dying... hmmm ew.
as for the chewing gum...
not to point fingers, but is that not so similar to an analogy of sin? we can&#039;t play with it, and not get stained/dirty by it.
ie: PR 6:27-28
27 Can a man scoop fire into his lap without his clothes being burned?
28 Can a man walk on hot coals without his feet being scorched?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[As for dream 1, you&#039;re most likely describing something called &quot;hypnic jerk&quot;.  The theory goes that as your muscles relax, right before you sleep, your brain misinterprets this relaxation thinking that you&#039;re falling, so it sends a signal to the rest of your muscles to &quot;jerk&quot;, to keep you from falling.  This happens more often to people who are sleep deprived.]]></description>
