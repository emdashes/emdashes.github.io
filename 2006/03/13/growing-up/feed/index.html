					<description><![CDATA[we called it &quot;soccer baseball&quot; and it was played with those really bouncy red rubber balls, about the size of a soccer ball.  the ones that would deflat sadly and suddently when it hit a spike on the yard fence.
haven&#039;t played that since grade school.
geeez.
as for climbing the ropes etc...
I needed to grow up (physically) before I could. it wans&#039;t until grade 10.
and in grade school, I was always too small to score well on that &quot;canada fitness test&quot; but then in one year I went from being bronze to Excellent.  yay growth hormones (natural)
I certainly became &#039;constrained&#039; by peer pressure and efforts to fit it.
it wasn&#039;t really until after university that I felt more liberated, particularly  b/c my peers today don&#039;t always care just about the quality of performance (be it sports or what), things have become less competitive and just more for pleasure/fun/leisure (in innocent ways... ;) )
altho, I&#039;m the one who&#039;s striving to get back to some competitive things, but while competitive, it&#039;s not a struggle for a limited resource of great value (only trophy/medal/top ranking / pretty girl), it&#039;s to see if you can do better than the last time (which I guess also entails besting a few others).
still uber self-conscious tho... just not as concerned about impressing anybody or &#039;looking good&#039; as I do it.
man that was such a high school pressure point....]]></description>
