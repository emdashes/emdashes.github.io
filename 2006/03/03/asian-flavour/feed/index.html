					<description><![CDATA[A medical specialist told me with a straight face that I should seriously
consider engaging in Qigong.
A westerner Christian told me he thought Zen and Christianity is compatible.
Dalai Lama is more like a political exile to me, but some in the west see him more as a spiritual guru.
All part of the current trend. Blind fascination in the East.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[troo dat on the boba...
even &quot;Zavida Coffee&quot; has a line of product from TeaShop 168...
but man is it poor recreation....
&#039;oriental&#039; makes me shudder, b/c I feel like it&#039;s referring to &#039;oriental asians&#039; as &#039;exotics&#039; by the colonials.
so I s/w feel like I&#039;m special, but in a zoo animal sort of way, and lumped into a whole pile of &#039;things related to the slanty eye&#039;
cuz really, I feel like they&#039;re using oriental only to distinguish betwen the yellow and brown (indian/pakistani) asians.  it lumps all the yellow cultures together, in a way that (I feel) only the colonials would refer to it (or I suppose, those ignorant to the subtle but major differences between the far east cultures)
and the whole colonial thing turns me off, b/c as colonials, they&#039;ve farmed the asian continent for their needs and taken what they wanted for centuries... grrr.....
it&#039;s payback time!
time for us to sell YOU some gimped weapons that you can&#039;t use to attack us back... (or even defend yourselves, but don&#039;t worry, we won&#039;t be coming in  ways that you&#039;ll light one or two or even three lanterns.... we&#039;ll be coming in your phone lines, and power lines... economic invasion...
oh man... why am I even referring to this as a &#039;we&#039;? I&#039;m a Canadian and don&#039;t &#039;benefit&#039; directly from the economic rise of Asia, unless there&#039;s some rich auntie I don&#039;t know about who&#039;s written me into her will...)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Apparently, the west has been obsessed with Eastern ways of life since the 60&#039;s, as seen in the whole hippie movement and their obsession with eastern philosophies.
As for &quot;Oriental&quot; being offensive, AmHerDic basically says that it&#039;s probably because of its earlier connotations when europeans saw the orient as &quot;exotic lands full of romance and intrigue, the home of despotic empires and inscrutable customs&quot;. Madam Butterfly probably didn&#039;t help with that one...
A secondary and weaker hypothesis is that the word &quot;oriental&quot; basically means &quot;eastern&quot; which makes it a eurocentric word.
Conversely, &quot;Asian&quot; is simply a reference of one&#039;s ancestral continent.
Dang, it&#039;s getting late... *poof*]]></description>
