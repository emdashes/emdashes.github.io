					<description><![CDATA[well, the simplified version is that fractures are of the bone - like cracks, or even breaking of the bone. the costochondral separation, as the name suggests, is a separation of the ribs with the cartilage that attaches it to your sternum (breastbone is the common term?). As for the &#039;bruised rib&#039;, that&#039;s all it is - a bruise around your rib cage (lots of tissue all around!), so no bone damage, which is why that wouldn&#039;t show up on an x-ray. ]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[last time, i went to the doc, and he told me that an x-ray would be useless as you can&#039;t do anything to heal a &quot;broken&quot; rib.  i didn&#039;t think one could &quot;bruise&quot; a rib either, but i&#039;ve googled the term and it seems to be commonplace.
the side, unfortunately, doesn&#039;t really distinguish what the differences between the three are...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[oh goodness. if you had  costochondral separation, you&#039;d be in big trouble... your site pretty much gives basic symptoms for fractured ribs though: pain while coughing or laughing, anything that increases that pressure in the ventral cavity. Can you really bruise your rib? If a rib is a bone, I can&#039;t picture it being &quot;bruised&quot;...but you certainly can &quot;bruise&quot; your lungs. ]]></description>
