					<description><![CDATA[Are we really in comfort? Anyone who has tried to maintain persistent spiritual disciplines (devotions, prayer, silence, solitude, etc.) will find the cost of discipleship to be heavy. We do not have to wait for physical tribulation - if we *want* to please God and live a life for him in this self-saturated world, we *will* find out how difficult it is and how serious sacrifices are required. Being a *faithful* Christian in the western world is not necessarily easier than in other parts of the world]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[you should read Dietrich Bonhoeffer, &quot;The Cost of Discipleship&quot;. In response to the last part about &#039;I am blessed with His grace... etc.&#039;, consider what Bonhoeffer says...&quot;The only man who has the right to say that he is justified by grace alone is the man who has left all to follow Christ.&quot; There is such a paradox in that. First you got grace which is basically something we don&#039;t deserve we&#039;re given and it&#039;s saying we can&#039;t say we&#039;re justified by that alone. So in order that we be justified by it alone we follow Christ, and Christ says that the road following him won&#039;t be easy, it won&#039;t be all roses and there will be tears and suffering.  So does that mean that we can be still justified by grace (being given something we don&#039;t deserve) because it seems we are doing a lot of stuff and almost earning it. The thing is... regardless of all we do in the world, nothing we do will ever be able to repay God for sacrificing Christ on the cross for us. That&#039;s really how big that sacrifice is for us.. it was more than for us to have eternal life, yo that&#039;s part of it. But it was for restoration, restoring us to that communion with God that Adam and Eve had with God in eden before the fall, the relationship.  now that we&#039;re restored, refer to genesis before the fall and find out how we are suppose to live. We aren&#039;t suppose to live for our own desires, we are suppose to live to worship God..and worship is surrender.
ok nice long comments for you-3 years of catching up i guess lol. take care.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[i don&#039;t feel it&#039;s wrong either. but we are asked to be the light of the world.  light isn&#039;t needed in places where light is already, it&#039;s not bad there.. but light is most needed in darkness. (sit in ur room tonight turn on the light and light a match..now turn off the light and do the same thing)..the effectiveness of it is an awesome comparison. if you feel your in a comfort zone and that&#039;s why you don&#039;t struggle, i pray that you step out of it.&quot; life is not meant to be lived to pay the rent, life a&#039;int meant to be working all these days so you can have a comfortable retirement,where you can walk on the beach and pick up seashells. at the end of it all God will ask you what do you have to show for the time i gave you, are you going to say &#039;look at my sea shells?&#039;&quot; (that&#039;s a paraphrase from John Piper). Have peace when you face tribulations though, cuz it is God that has overcome it for you.]]></description>
