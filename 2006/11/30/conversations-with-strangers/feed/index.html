					<description><![CDATA[I was once approached by a homeless guy while I was waiting in a movie ticket line. He tried to sell me a box of cookies that he was carrying.  Looking at him, all I could think was, &quot;why the heck haven&#039;t you eaten the cookies?&quot;
Another time I was approached by what appeared to be a well dressed woman who told me that she had lost her wallet and didn&#039;t have enough for bus fare back to White Rock.  I gave her the $4.50 for that, but as she walked away, I realized that her eyes looked kinda glazed over, and her make-up was kinda messy. Sure enough, a month later she approached me again at the same bus stop. She didn&#039;t even break stride when I told her &quot;you&#039;ve already gotten me once&quot; as she launched into her story...just smiled and headed for the next person.
