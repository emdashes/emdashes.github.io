					<description><![CDATA[Didn&#039;t work last time I tried posting... but here goes again. I doubt I&#039;m a Hebrew expert, but I am a man expert. I would say: &quot;don&#039;t settle. ever.&quot; A dangerous man in the right context is a good thing. A docile man... I met this guy who complains, whines and demands attention all the time. I just feel like smacking him. Don&#039;t settle. As for falling in love, I&#039;m told when it happens you&#039;ll know.... I never known and STILL don&#039;t know.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[God is &quot;nice&quot; but still lays the smackdown when he needs to. So should a well balanced Christian man. Men and Women should both strive to reflect the image of God...there was never a &quot;thou shalt be nice&quot; commandment, and &quot;love thy enemies&quot; doesn&#039;t mean &quot;don&#039;t have enemies&quot;.
lust = how can she make me feel happy?
love = how can i make her happy?
