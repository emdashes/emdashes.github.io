					<description><![CDATA[Traditions connect us with the vast experience of the past. To throw away traditions completely is to be disconnected. To be rigid and inflexible over traditions is to ignore their shortcomings and to disregard our changing situations.
&quot;Dig deep into your own tradition, but find fresh ways to express it today.&quot; For those who are of the Alliance tradition, you had better find out who AB Simpson and AW Tozer are!!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I think habits and traditions are an important part of the evolution of our society.  Instead of only relying on genes to shape our behaviour, we can also rely on traditions.  Habits that supply enough of a benefit survive to become traditions.  Traditions that become a big enough hindrance are lost (to the population at large).  It&#039;s probably good that there are people like your friend who drop traditions--otherwise we&#039;d be stuck with ones that don&#039;t work.  And it&#039;s probably good that we have people like you that stick with traditions, otherwise we&#039;d lose what works.  And if everybody had the same traditions, well that&#039;s a monoculture, and that&#039;s just bad (you end up with a fungus wiping out all the tasty bananas ;-)

					<description><![CDATA[Traditions and habits aren&#039;t the same thing...Traditions/customs are handed down generation by generation...the Bible itself is a Tradition. The tradition in and of itself is not a good/bad thing, although many people think it&#039;s cool to be progressive meaning throwing traditions out the window (including the Bible and the teachings of Christ and the Apostles?)
The practice of religion which includes regular prayer, self-examination, going to church is developed through habit like the athlete practising. We need to make it our own and the weekly and daily rhythm by which we do that helps to sanctify our time and develop a working relationship with our Lord. The relationship is religion. You cannot have a relationship with God without religion, and you cannot have religion without a relationship.
There&#039;s your distinction.]]></description>
