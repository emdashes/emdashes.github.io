					<description><![CDATA[Canoeing - left.
think about an airplane wing.
air moves faster on the topside of a wing due to the low pressure, and that pulls the plane up.
paddling on the left side =&gt; faster moving water =&gt; low pressure =&gt; canoe pulls left.
to counter it? you gotta J stroke on the right: as you finish your paddle stroke,   tophand thumb starts to point fwd/away from you, this should start to turn the paddle blade &#039;vertical&#039; or parallel to the canoe. as you pull back with the bottom hand, push it out and away from the canoe a bit.  now this might require a bit more strength than you&#039;ve got, so you can finish the J with more of a &#039;pry&#039; stroke--instead of pushing the bottom hand out, you can place it against the side of the canoe, and pull your top hand downwards across your lap towards the knee on the same side as this hand.  this is essentially as if the bottom hand is braced against the side of the canoe, and you&#039;re trying to PRY it sideways.
go play!
me so jealous I haven&#039;t had time to go out canoeing yet this year.
