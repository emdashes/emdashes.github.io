					<description><![CDATA[methinks its important to meet s/o through your community. be it directly in your immediate circle (hopefully not TOO new a newcomer to the circle--you do need to know something about their character before linking up) or through the one-2 degree of separation. now cmty can be church, school, orgnizations, clubs.
why? I believe it&#039;s very important to see how the person interacts in different environments and in groups.  how you as a couple interact is groups is very important too.  the modern definition of a &quot;social unit&quot; is the individual. but in God&#039;s definition, the family is an element of the BODY, therefore singles-couples-families are to work not in isolation but in teamwork with the BODY.  the other support for going w/i your circle is the greater likelihood that you&#039;ll share interests, while divergent interests can add value to a relationship, what better if you can do a few things together? or share some passions? it SUCKS to constantly be bumping heads b/c you want to go in opposite directions.
I met my s/o at church. she&#039;d been around for 1.5 years and we&#039;d known each other as talking friends for a good 6-8 mnths before &#039;dating&#039; and THEN spending some time alone. (note, time alone, pre-DTR was very limited).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[dunno about Lavalife ;)
I&#039;m go on serving God and hopefully find someone along the way; and if it doesn&#039;t happen, it doesn&#039;t happen.
I&#039;ve been *single* for 27 years, I think I can hold out for another 50 or so..]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It seems all so planned out when you look back. But when you went through it, it seemed as though you simply stumbled across that special someone. The odd thing is, &quot;The harder you seek, the harder to find.&quot; When you are focussed on God&#039;s priorities in your life, &quot;you find even if you did not seek.&quot; Wow, I&#039;m a Zen master.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I met my SO on Lavalife.  It&#039;s not as random as the club scene--you can narrow your search by what&#039;s important to you.  I figured out the 5 most important things to me, and did my search accordingly.  All relationships are going to have rough spots, but if you share an idea of what&#039;s important, it makes things a little easier (at least, I think so).  If your church is the most important thing to you, then the church is the place to look.
YMMV
