					<description><![CDATA[well, it&#039;s really saying &quot;I don&#039;t like you enough to spend the rest of my life intimately with you.&quot;  &quot;I don&#039;t like you enough to want to wake up next to you every morning.&quot; &quot;I don&#039;t want to give myself to you, I don&#039;t want to be yoked with you. You&#039;re not who I imagine as my partner to endure and enjoy life.&quot;
&quot;I don&#039;t want to submit myself to you.  I don&#039;t like you enough to make big sacrifices for you.&quot;  &quot;something about you doesn&#039;t jive with me, there&#039;s something i can&#039;t live with/without.&quot;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Interesting debate. Perhaps I&#039;ve never had a relationship before but I agree I&#039;m one of those who thinks seriously before making before having the courage to ask the girl to be my gf. I will take it quite hard, but hey, I&#039;ve never been loved. Or is it that I&#039;ve never truly love.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[it is virtually impossible for guys and girls to remain just friends. one or the other will usually want something more. when that happens, people get hurt. i&#039;m not saying that there are no guys/girls that remain just friends, but it&#039;s a rarity.
guys hate the line &quot;let&#039;s be friends&quot; because that&#039;s one of the most used rejections they&#039;re probably heard. it&#039;s almost as bad as &quot;i love you like a brother&quot;. as a guy, i think that if i have the guts to tell you that i like you, then you should have the guts to tell me that you don&#039;t like me that way.
most of the time, guys aren&#039;t looking for a girl friend. they are looking for a girlfriend. when guys and girls are friends, 95% of the time, it&#039;s because the guy liked the girl at one point of his life. gaining a friend really isn&#039;t much of a consolation prize for a guy being rejected. in fact, it probably serves as a constant reminder that she is too good for him. anyway... enough about that.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[By continuing this type of &quot;friend&quot; relationship, he would be portraying himself as someone who has nothing better to do than hang around with a girl who is not that interested in him. The relationship will never get to where he wants to go - for some romance, passion, and love.
If, on the other hand, the guy walks away from this relationship, he has established that he is the type used to leading a relationship, he has plenty of other girls willing to take him on his terms, and she is losing out.

					<description><![CDATA[b/c for the generally shy guy/girl (the ones who will be saddened by that response), it took great courage to ask/get to that point.  to get there, a certain amount of hope was req&#039;d.  and if the answer is &quot;no, I don&#039;t share your sentiments&quot;, then
a) the one who &#039;put it out on the line&#039; was mistaken.
b) kills hope. loss of hope is sad.
b/c of the amt of hope that there was, it may hurt to much to be just friends, it&#039;s a reminder of the two above points. and since it will be awkward to be friends, the person may also feel like they&#039;ve lost a friend.
I may also venture that this happens more with introverts, shy folks, or those who put a lot of weight into their decisions/actions. so when they&#039;re &#039;wrong/mistaken&#039; there&#039;s loss of confidence as well. losing a good friend with whom you had much hope, is more painful that a friendship that isn&#039;t as deep.

					<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s not you; it&#039;s me...I don&#039;t like you.
Aside from the fact?  Isn&#039;t that enough of a reason to hate the line?  Got really sick of it myself.  Heard it about once a month for, oh, maybe ten years.  It&#039;s the polite way of saying, &quot;well, you&#039;re nice, smart, and funny, but you&#039;re also ugly, so, um, go away.&quot;  Even if that&#039;s not how it was intended, or even meant, it&#039;s still a rejection, and those sting.
I have a few close female friends, but I&#039;ve had them since I was very young.  My SO wouldn&#039;t be happy if I was hanging around recently made female friends.  Especially if they are single.

					<description><![CDATA[Personally, I really hate that line myself too.  hahaha.  &quot;Let&#039;s be friends&quot; is just a sugar-coated way to say &quot;I don&#039;t like you&quot;.  I&#039;m sure that&#039;s not what they mean but that&#039;s how it implies.
