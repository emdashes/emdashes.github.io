					<description><![CDATA[Oh, the guys are getting stupid now too.  I&#039;m a regular user of Oil of Olay (or is it just Olay now?), but the wife hates the smell--she prefers the Dove night moisturizer I use instead.  Yeah, wrinkles may be manly, but I still don&#039;t like having them.  I&#039;ve been buying $10 hand-made glycerin soap for a while now too.  Take a quick look at the shaving ailse now, and you&#039;ll see lots of stuff with silly prices.
For face cleaners, I&#039;m partial to Herbal Logix - the one with the little grape seeds in it :-p  London Drugs should carry it.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[i&#039;m not sure what a &quot;good&quot; cleanser is - i think it depends on the skin type and preference.  i would suggest to try something from johnson and johnson (like neutrogena, clean and clear, aveeno).]]></description>
