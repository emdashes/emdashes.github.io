				<![CDATA[
<p>Six months ago, our littlest had an IgE blood test: one nurse took his blood, the other stood by in case he needed to pin him down. I covered my son&#8217;s eyes, she took blood; he flinched at the poke, didn&#8217;t move until it was done and when asked by the nurse if it hurt, he answered, &#8220;nope,&#8221; and looked at them as if to say, &#8220;what, is it supposed to hurt?&#8221; Turns out, he did far better than some adults they&#8217;ve seen.</p>


<p>The report came back, and it was negative for milk, which suggested that  his chance of having an anaphylactic / severe allergic reaction to dairy was less than 25%. I was hopeful! After all, he had some accidental encounters with dairy a handful of times without severe reaction, but there&#8217;s the rub &#8211; his skin didn&#8217;t do as well, and reacted with the milk with the skin prick test . And, this is why you can&#8217;t rely on a blood test alone; that&#8217;s why an allergist has to consider the history of and individual (how they&#8217;ve responded to the allergen in the past) with a combination of tells before making a diagnosis.</p>


<p>When he finally weaned this summer, I happily jumped on the dairy bandwagon again &#8211; with a grilled cheese sandwich as the dairy product that I wanted to celebrate with first. Sadly, it was a variant of a jalapeno popper that wasn&#8217;t as satisfying as a grilled cheese would have been. A few weeks later, I noticed that the skin around my neck was starting to get red, patchy, and quite itchy at times; I&#8217;ve only had eczema around my neck once, and it was during my academic years, so I had figured it was stress induced.</p>


<p>Yet, it seemed to get better when I limited my dairy intake, but flared up again when I  threw caution to the wind over the holidays. I suspect it just might be my body responding to the reintroduction to dairy as some foreign matter. The allergist, in brief conversation, asked me if I was allergic to milk as a child. Why yes, I had recently discovered that while I knew my mother didn&#8217;t know I was allergic to milk until much later &#8212; even though I was vomiting after having any, I didn&#8217;t realize that the doctor didn&#8217;t suggest this to her until I was almost 3 years old! (that might explain why I don&#8217;t like milk now, even though I like many other dairy products). </p>


<p>I expect that if a naturopath confirmed my food sensitivities, she might recommend avoiding the foods that trigger an autoimmune response. Yet, the allergist recommended that if it was only a skin response, that I shouldn&#8217;t eliminate it completely, because he had found in his experience that if children cut out the foods in their diet, and then came into exposure with it down the road, the reaction ends up being a lot worse than before. This is what I wanted to hear, I suppose, because that means I can still have dairy &#8211; but perhaps in moderation.  My family doctor suspects it&#8217;s all related to the chronic skin conditions that I have elsewhere on my body, but I suppose one can never really know; all I know is that the skin is just a visible sign that something is awry with your autoimmune system &#8211; it might be your gut, might be something else inside</p>


<p>The allergist has given the green light to proceed with the oral challenge with the littlest next month, but in a hospital setting in case he needs treatment, so here&#8217;s to hoping &#8230;and praying &#8211; God knows what He&#8217;s doing!<br /></p>

				<![CDATA[Three things I've learned today: <ul><li>Black is in. If you are invited to a (non-Asian, millennial) evening wedding and reception, it is perfectly okay (and hip) to wear a black dress. Even the bridesmaid was wearing a black dress; black is the new red.</li><li>European-style roasted pig is different than the Chinese BBQ suckling pig way &#8211; the European way is more like roasted stuffed pig that you can carve which taste like chorizo; the skin is still nice and crispy though!</li><li>KW is really <i><strong>that</strong></i> small. We don&#8217;t really know the bride that much so it was a real surprise to discover that we go to the same church as her parents. Our new aunt and uncle-in-laws are in our church family! Why this is crazy?</li><li>My cousin&#8217;s family are not regular church-goers and they don&#8217;t live here.</li><li>We have only been going to this church for approximately a year, in a different neighbourhood than where the bride&#8217;s family lives.</li><li>Of all the churches here (there is at least one in every neighbourhood, if not more), we ended up at the same church as their family &#8211; and only found out at the wedding. (this point is especially meaningful because feeling like I belong is important to me, and God knew all this time &#8211; a good topic for a future reflective post)</li><li>On top of that, j.w has been playing pickleball with the bride&#8217;s father for the past few months without realizing the connection.</li><li>I had known that the bride&#8217;s family was &#8220;Mennonite from Ayr&#8221;; I did not connect &#8220;Mennonite Bretheren&#8221;with &#8220;Mennonite&#8221;. Upon finding this out, my aunt asked me if we were Mennonite, and I said no, we&#8217;re not Mennonite &#8211; it was really hard to explain, but I guess she might have understood it better if I made the comparison of going to a Catholic church without actually being Catholic, or a Chinese church without being Chinese.</li></ul>I had expected going to the wedding knowing only my cousins and the family, but it turned out, we knew a table of other guests and had a connection to both sides of the family; what a delight and such a joy to celebrate with and to get to know both sides a bit better! Only God could&#8217;ve made this possible, and He&#8217;s not done&#8230; <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> ]]&gt;		]]></content:encoded>

				<![CDATA[<p>Another year has flown by and has it been one of growing:</p> <p>We&#8217;ve had the joy to watch Little Brother be a part of the family, and influencing his sister to creatively explore boundaries (Bean&#8217;s thinking: what? the mattress can be a bouncy castle? and the couch seats can come apart and be a landing mat? Let&#8217;s do it!).</p> <p>Language literacy: from broken English at the start of the year to full-on conversations with his sister in English (almost) all the time, which is way too much &#8211; but as Bean observed, the parents speak to each other in English all the time as well. He surprised me when he verbally counted to 10 in both French and Spanish as well; I&#8217;m also surprised that he manages to get through an hour of weekly Cantonese classes!</p><p>I credit his recognition of numbers from 1-8 to the numbers of the trains, and his colour-recognition also to Thomas. We&#8217;ve</p> also seen his keen interest in music and singing (but not others singing while he&#8217;s singing), and in storytime and books. I especially cherish the times, when he says sorry and means it (he also smart about saying sorry to get out of trouble) and at meal times, particularly when he is enjoying his food, he asks who made it and thanks the person who did! <p>Motor skills: from falling down stairs to mastering riding a tricycle; from solving puzzles patiently to picking up art activities like colouring (scribbling) and playdough; from playing with his trains &#8211; Thomas, to zooming around with Lighting McQueen and his Hot Wheels cars and car wash garage station, and firetrucks; from taking off his clothes by himself to putting on his shirt, jacket (and zipping), socks, and boots by himself.</p> <p>Pretend play and following his sister: it&#8217;s really confusing when they&#8217;re addressing each other around us as he&#8217;s the baby and she&#8217;s the mommy/mama. But, it&#8217;s so endearing when they get along and act in their assigned roles &#8211; him being so forgiving without seeming to mind that she&#8217;s bossing him around for the most part. Though he&#8217;s a preschooler, he&#8217;s truly still the baby when it comes to falling asleep and sleeping independently.</p> <p>This upcoming year will our last with him before he enters school; I think he&#8217;ll be ready when September rolls along!</p>]]&gt;		]]></content:encoded>

<p class="has-drop-cap">When you ask Little Brother how old he is, he holds up two fingers, and confidently says, &#8220;Three!&#8221; While I find myself correcting him almost every time, mathematically, I suppose he isn&#8217;t incorrect.</p>


<p>At the age he is at now, he&#8217;s starting to identify colours (or colors, for my American friends). He knows &#8220;black&#8221; and &#8220;wipe&#8221; (white), and maybe he knows the others too, but when you ask him what shirt he&#8217;s wearing, or what colour Daddy is wearing today, he might respond with &#8220;Thomas!&#8221;, &#8220;Percy!&#8221;, or &#8220;James!&#8221;. Some days, he might mention Emily or Stephen / Rocket too. It just so happens, those are the colours of  Thomas the train and friends; so, I suppose he isn&#8217;t incorrect.</p>


<p class="has-background has-very-light-gray-background-color">I&#8217;ve come to realize that although Bean doesn&#8217;t often show affection towards people, she deeply cares and loves her little brother. This side of her shows when we are trying to threaten him or put him in time out, she pleas that we don&#8217;t carry through (&#8220;I don&#8217;t want him to go to the hospital&#8221; or &#8220;don&#8217;t leave him!&#8221;) or wants to follow him into time out and be with him. So, in case you missed it &#8211; because I almost did: her favourite colour is no longer green, but currently, &#8220;Thomas&#8221;; I think his is James &#8211; because she has designated the red train in our set for him. He likes trains, so now, she does too.</p>

<p>I recently re-joined the dairy (and nut) wagon, officially marking the end of a temporary journey in being certain nuts and dairy free. When j.w asked me which food I would try first when I got here, I decided on a grilled cheese sandwich.</p>


<p>Turns out, it was a jalapeno munchie from the Fish Hut. And the next day, I tried adding a tad of cream in my coffee as I enjoyed it before, but the cream ruined it! The coffee the tasted so&#8230;well, <em>creamy</em>.</p>


<p>Throughout the week, I&#8217;ve been having other things that have dairy in it, such as a piece of Tim Horton&#8217;s donuts, shared by co-workers (not worth it), Marble Slab ice cream (sadly, it melted far too quickly), and a Matter of Taste cappuccino. The velvety smooth foam of the cappuccino &#8211; that is definitely something I&#8217;ve missed; soy or almond milk cappuccinos just aren&#8217;t the same. Yet, by the time I got to the bottom of it when it had cooled down, it was again, too <em>creamy. </em>Sigh.</p>


<p>And, yes, pizza with real cheese is so much better than vegan &#8220;cheese&#8221; &#8211; I especially enjoy the stringiness of the melted cheese! I also had my first slice of toasted cheese bread that I had stored in the deep-freezer a few months ago. This also means, I can probably defrost the banana bread (containing milk products) that a church friend brought over from Stone Crock and make a batch of Monk Chocolate hot chocolate too!</p>


<p>The best of it was matcha ice cream in the hojicha milk float from Tsujiri. I switched with j.w because the matcha latte I got tasted too <em>creamy</em><em>.</em></p>


<p>So, this is likely where I start to put on even more weight. And watch out, I&#8217;m probably lactose intolerant again. But I&#8217;m excited for the possibilities, like broasted chicken and Anna Mae&#8217;s pies: rhubarb custard anyone?</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				<![CDATA[The last government under Kathleen Wynne had promised free childcare for preschoolers (2.5-Kindergarten) beginning 2020, so I didn't pay much attention to it. What I didn't know was that <a href="https://news.ontario.ca/opo/en/2018/03/more-child-care-more-choice.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the government also gave extra funding to daycare centres</a>, so that parents end up saving a few dollars a day! So lesson is, do your research when comparing home daycare and daycare centres. I&#8217;m sad that they didn&#8217;t extend it to licensed home childcare providers, since the region keeps trying to recruit people to either open up a licensed home daycare <em>or</em> send their children into licensed home daycare.


<hr />
When we were looking for child care late last year, we signed up for the region&#8217;s &#8220;OneList&#8221; &#8211; which is essentially a one-stop shop for licensed childcare options. At the time, I had place my child&#8217;s name into home child-care providers in addition to a waitlist of daycare centres close by. Well, 6 months later, a few spots opened up in the daycare centres and initially, it seemed like the cost was between $10-15 more a day to have a child in a daycare centre. When we visited one, I felt like it was pretty chaotic (and overwhelming), with 1 adult to 8 kids in a pretty tight space. I had pretty much written off that option until a recent visit to another daycare centre changed my mind because:


<ol>
    

<li>Even though they both belonged to the same organization, the space felt so much more open, with a big room and high ceilings and a shaded outdoor natural area for play. And, because this daycare centre isn&#8217;t attached to a school, you don&#8217;t get school aged kids going, which makes it seem less crazy, maybe?</li>


    

<li>This daycare centre doesn&#8217;t bill for stat holidays, Christmas week, and you get an additional two weeks unbilled. Home daycares bill year round, unless the caregiver cannot provide care for that day.</li>


    

<li>With the bonus unbilled days and the extra funding from the government that brought daycare costs down by a couple of dollars a day, it seems like it&#8217;s cheaper to send my child to one day of daycare than to keep him in home childcare full-time! (numbers below are approximate)</li>

While the cost differential isn&#8217;t very significant per year for us (though every dollar might count for a family with a tighter budget), we made the switch part-time as we felt our child might benefit from going to a more &#8220;school-like&#8221; program (closer to the kindergarten learning model) since he&#8217;ll be going to school (far too) soon. However, I&#8217;m not ready to give up <a href="https://www.sapcrc.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the PCRC</a> and our caregiver yet, so hopefully this will work out.]]&gt;		</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				<![CDATA[Our same friends (who we travelled with last time) had a last-minute spot open up in their suite, so we took the opportunity to fly down again to spend 6 days there. What did we do this time?
Unfortunately, it rained every single day. Turned out that we had hit the first week of wet season. And when it rains, the frog-toads come out at night and they just sit there staring at you as you walk by or through their paths...


<h3>Swimming and resort activities</h3>


Because the resort had a really kid-friendly pools / water play area and some decent free activities to do in the mornings (like kinetic sand play), the kids spent non<span style="font-size: 1rem; background-color: transparent;">-rainy times in the pool; I even found the water-slide quite safe for non-swimmers like myself!</span>
&nbsp;
[caption id="attachment_6580" align="alignnone" width="700"]<img class="wp-image-6580 size-full" src="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/marriottharbourlake-1.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="383" srcset="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/marriottharbourlake-1.jpg 700w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/marriottharbourlake-1-300x164.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /> One of the larger kid-friendly pools. A social commentary on what we&#8217;re seeing more and more: the couple on the left were interacting with their phones while enjoying their drinks instead of chatting with each other[/caption]
And when they were out of the pool, we attempted to play mini-golf but didn&#8217;t actually get through a game because of the poor weather. The resort also had a nice little gated play structure for kids to play on as well, which was under utilized and therefore great when Bean went on to play while her brother was napping back in the room.
One unexpected activity that everyone took part in at around 830 AM in the morning was the false fire alarm, so everyone evacuated with bed head and sleepy eyes. Thankfully, it happened at 830 and not 3AM in the morning, and it wasn&#8217;t raining.


<h3>Museums and science centers</h3>


[caption id="attachment_6561" align="alignright" width="225"]<img class="size-medium wp-image-6561" src="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/climber-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300" srcset="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/climber-225x300.jpg 225w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/climber-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/climber-1568x2090.jpg 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" /> Tampa&#8217;s Children&#8217;s Museum[/caption]
Before we left, our friend told us about a family membership at a science centre in BC with reciprocal memberships in Canada and around the world that you could buy online &#8211; and for 3 years, it didn&#8217;t even cost as much as 1 year at our local museum (which isn&#8217;t as great as the ones we&#8217;ve explored so far).  The caveat is that you can&#8217;t use it within 90 mile radius of your address and within 90 miles around the centre you bought it from, which means we can still visit Science World but not the Toronto Science Centre or London Children&#8217;s Museum with this membership. Seeing that we will likely make a visit to BC and Washington State in the next 3 years, we will definitely try to make sure to use this membership to visit Science World and the flight museum and the children&#8217;s museum in Everett!
Anyway, we used this newly bought membership at Orlando Science Center and drove a little ways out (to sunnier and warmer weather) to Tampa Children&#8217;s Museum and spent two afternoons indoors, in air conditioning and sheltered by the rain. The kids seemed to have a great time, and I enjoyed going through the two places as well &#8211; my favourites were seeing the glee at the silk vacuüm tube in the Science Center and the sand sensory table (made possible by a kinect and a projector!) and the mesh climber at the Children&#8217;s Museum.


<h3>Shopping areas</h3>


[caption id="attachment_6562" align="alignright" width="300"]<img class="size-medium wp-image-6562" src="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/DSC_0842-300x169.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="169" srcset="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/DSC_0842-300x169.jpg 300w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/DSC_0842-768x432.jpg 768w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/DSC_0842-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/DSC_0842-1568x882.jpg 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /> Soap bars at Basin, Disney Springs[/caption]
We also spent some time at the Florida Mall play spaces and walking around and taking the short ferry taxi around Disney Springs (and digging in the dino pit at T-Rex Cafe). For date night, j.w and I went back to Disney Springs to try a VR experience where you walk from room to room immersed in a Star Wars shooting adventure with Oculus packs. It was $30 for about 30 minutes, which I feel is a little steep but I think it was worth the experience. This time, I stopped in at Basin because I read online that you could get soap ends at a discount, and while they aren&#8217;t completely natural (though they do have a natural line), the soap bars look too cool and smell edible &#8211; they remind of Fimo tubes encased in glycerin; the Mickey ear silhouettes looked the most fitting!


<h3>Food</h3>




<h4>Repeats</h4>


We went back to the Southern BBQ place at Disney Springs, as well as Q&#8217;nenans. To my surprise, the FoH manager recognized us and welcomed us back! And then they threw in some chicken avocado mix when we just ordered the bread on the side; talk about excellent customer service! We also returned to Sweet Tomatoes twice, as the kids seemed to eat well there and the prices are very reasonable, especially with the buy $50 get $10 promo combined with a 25% off coupon &#8211; we found out that the prices actually vary depending on location, and the one in Tampa seems quieter and even cheaper than the one in Orlando (~$12 for soup-salad bar dinner).
This time, at Disney Springs, I found a allergen-friendly bakery, but I forgot that I usually find the texture of gluten-free baked goods to be a bit off. Sadly, I also found their loaf cake / tea cake to be overly sweet and not moist enough.


<h4>Fish</h4>


[caption id="attachment_6563" align="alignright" width="300"]<img class="size-medium wp-image-6563" src="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/DSC_0870-300x169.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="169" srcset="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/DSC_0870-300x169.jpg 300w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/DSC_0870-768x432.jpg 768w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/DSC_0870-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/DSC_0870-1568x882.jpg 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /> Poke bowl with generous toppings and portion size at Lemonshark Poke[/caption]
We also tried sushi on a belt at Florida Mall [ref] &#8211; this brought me back to high school or early university days when we went to eat at Metrotown / Metropolis which had a restaurant with this concept; it didn&#8217;t seem to stick around for very long [/ref], which the kids loved, and the pricing wasn&#8217;t too bad for the quality; you just had to know what to order so you wouldn&#8217;t be paying too much in the end. On the last day, we also went to a really good poke bowl place, with huge portions for a really reasonable price; it outshines any poke bowl places I&#8217;ve had outside of Hawaii so far.


<h4>And more&#8230;</h4>


[caption id="attachment_6564" align="alignright" width="225"]<img class="size-medium wp-image-6564" src="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/DSC_0873-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300" srcset="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/DSC_0873-225x300.jpg 225w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/DSC_0873-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/DSC_0873-1568x2091.jpg 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" /> Cooking post-dinner at Wegman&#8217;s, a family-friendly grocery store[/caption]
j.w&#8217;s coworker recommended an Asian fusion burritos place, which she said was &#8220;life-changing&#8221; but I found it super slow (he explained as I was paying that a cook had walked out mid-shift) and it was quite salty, so it&#8217;s not on my list of returns. However, j.w&#8217;s cousin&#8217;s recommendation of Tasty Wok on Imperial / Asian street was quite authentic, despite the &#8220;steam table concept&#8221; name. Speaking of &#8220;steamed table&#8221; / hot foods table, in Buffalo, we stopped at Wegmans for dinner, and their battered fish was really crispy and just really good, except when I went back to get more, they were closing their food offering and had taken any left away <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f641.png" alt="🙁" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> What was really nice was that this Wegmans had a jazz trio playing and a relatively large kids&#8217; play area / corner so you could enjoy your food with live music and watch your kids playing, all for free [ref] plus they also stocked free diapers for emergencies including pampers pull-ups in their washrooms[/ref]!

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				<![CDATA[This spring has certainly sprung some surprises, some better than others:


<h2>Ralph S. Mouse (the S stands for smart)</h2>


Let&#8217;s begin with a story of the mouse. If you have followed my stories for some years now, you might recall <a href="https://her.happyhippos.ca/2008/04/mouse-in-house/">the story of j.w catching a live mouse with a waste basket</a>. I was hoping it was a one-time incident; instead, I found myself mentioning to j.w that I saw a grey blob scurrying near the baseboard on the kitchen floor as I was chatting with j.wu after small group one night. j.w investigated and found some droppings in the corner of our kitchen floor! We eventually found a few favourite places it liked to hide when we saw signs of it: particularly behind the bookcase in the basement and behind/in the stove; and, I had accidentally discovered where it likely came from: the range hood vent. I only know this because I went into the cupboard above the stove and found the silicon sleeve on our coffee carafe broken. My first thought? How cheap! And then, one of us realized it had been chewed through. Lo and behold, there was a bunch of droppings all over the cupboard, which of course I had missed because of my height. Who knows how long it&#8217;s been living among us!
So, the cat and mouse game began. First, the live traps were placed, but they consistently turned up empty, and there was no sign of a mouse anywhere; it seemed that even the food crumbs from our children&#8217;s messy eating habits were ignored. Until. I found a bun stuck between where the oven vents out into the stove a couple of weeks later. I was baffled at how it got there as I had thrown it out into the green bin bag myself; then I realized that the mouse must have tried to sneak it into its hiding place by going through the oven vents and because the bun was so big, it jammed!! Well, within 24 hours of placing the snap trap that PT recommended, it caught it. And, there hasn&#8217;t been a mouse indoors since.  And now, the little ants have returned (they get into the house every spring for a few weeks until the powder keeps them away); oddly [ref] it&#8217;s odd because she&#8217;s afraid of bugs in general, like spiders [/ref], Bean says she likes them and even have picked up a few to watch them crawl on her hands.

<h2>120 km/h wind storm</h2>


If a trees falls in a forest, does it make a sound? It certainly makes a big splash.
Then there was the ice storm and the wind storm, followed by some wicked summer weather (30C plus). The ice storm wasn&#8217;t much of an ice storm compared to the earlier ones, but the wind storm knocked down many trees. I happened to be sitting on the couch looking out into the forest and saw a giant tree fall into the bog &#8211; it was quite the splash. Our loose fascia ripped off and it&#8217;s missing &#8211; but we discovered that it was loose in the first place because annoying wasps had made a nest under it a while back. But, we were the fortunate ones, roofing and other repair companies are at capacity for the next month or so because some other houses had batches of shingles and even the siding at the side of the house stripped off from the wind! I still see big trees on the ground or on wooden fences around the neighbourhoods we drive by.


<hr />


<h2>Team dynamics</h2>


I&#8217;m approaching 6 months, and a new office! Within the last few months, I&#8217;ve discovered some interesting stats about the makeup of our current team; our newest hire will change it but until then:

<hr />


<h2>Nose injuries</h2>


Well, since our mild hand-foot-mouth incident with our little guy (&#8220;diagnosed by Google&#8221; when we noticed that his fingernails were peeling a few weeks following rash symptoms), he&#8217;s had a couple of accidents:


<ol>
    

<li>He fell from the steps onto his nose. Thankfully, it was a superficial injury, so it healed up relatively quickly. Now we can say that they both have fallen down the stairs at the same age (she rolled down a whole flight from what I could tell and sustained carpet burn injuries)</li>


    

<li>A few weeks later, after it healed, he falls from a trike onto the gym floor and on his nose again. His nose was bleeding off and on for a day, so we took him to the doctor before a trip, just to make sure he was okay. Thankfully, he was fine (and no concussions either as they don&#8217;t wear helmets inside)!</li>


</ol>




<hr />


<h2>The better surprises</h2>


Two visits &#8211; the highlights!


<ol>
    

<li>A lovely visit from a friend and her family from Hong Kong, whom I haven&#8217;t seen in a few years <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></li>


    

<li>A last-minute trip to Orlando (again) for almost a week &#8211; a separate post will follow  since we skipped all theme parks this time around!</li>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				<![CDATA[Less than a month ago, I shared a story on Facebook about how we (I) lost (dropped) Bean's glove on our walk home from school. If you missed it, I've included it here - and if you've read it already, read on:


<blockquote>When short prayers get answered quickly:
Along our walk home today, I discovered that we lost a Kombi mitt. We retraced our steps back to school and even checked the lost and found without it turning up.
As we were heading back, I told Bean that we should pray about it and ask God for help in returning it. Why of course, just as we leave from the school yard, I see a pink mitt standing tall on a wire-fence post near a tree. Some kind soul must have put it there in hopes it would be reunited with its other half. Yet, I had missed seeing that when we had first entered the school yard even though it was completely in my line of sight!</blockquote>


This week, Bean went on a class field trip to a grocery store within walking distance. The teachers had asked them to put their mitts inside the sleeves of their jackets so they wouldn&#8217;t lose it. Sometime between the trip and the day of the school day, one of her pink Kombi mitts went missing, again!
No, it wasn&#8217;t in her sleeves, not in the lost and found at Sobeys or at the school, wasn&#8217;t in her cubby, and it didn&#8217;t reappear by the end of the next day. By the third day, as I was getting out of the car to pick her up, I sort of mumbled a quick prayer, hoping for a miracle because I liked these much more than the hot paws we had. I even thought about retracing the steps they took, but when I saw her, she happily waved her two hands, with <i>both </i>Kombi mitts on them! <i>Answered prayers!</i>
Although she couldn&#8217;t quite tell me where she found them initially, she then told me she found it in her cubby; her teacher told me she had emptied her cubby and looked multiple times without seeing anything. Later on, Bean tells me what sounds a tall tale (but more likely a true one from her perspective that looks drastically different to an adult): that her mitt was hanging above her cubby from the ceiling and she had to take a block as a stool to stand up to reach it.
Stranger things have happened (e.g. me finding a lost wedding ring in grass; a lost diamond in a car trunk) [ref] this is all connected to one of my first summer camp experiences where a camp counsellor-later turned pastor told us a story about how he couldn&#8217;t find his keys, so he knelt down and prayed and as soon as he was done, God opened his eyes and it was somehow right in front of him; he didn&#8217;t know how he could&#8217;ve missed it before! This story has stuck with me and has empowered me to pray, especially when things are lost [/ref], so this is just one of the many times where God shows up in the little things! (Still missing the wallet with $400US so not all prayers get answered with a yes right away).]]&gt;		</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				<![CDATA[That's our office cat in the photo. I'm one month in. And yet, it feels like a lot longer than that. I've found a rhythm that works with this new routine, and I'm thankful that both our kids have adjusted well too. Consequently, we transitioned our oldest to full day kindergarten, and after some trial and error, we dropped her afternoon nap, we eat dinner earlier, and they go to sleep earlier. Unfortunately, our youngest still wakes up at night and asks for food then, but our oldest seems to fall asleep faster and stays asleep throughout the night for the most part. This week has been one of the few germ-free weeks this year, so it's a nice relief to not have to deal with that (if it wasn't him, it was her, and if it wasn't either of them, it was us or our daycare) - I'm grateful that our workplaces are pretty flexible when it comes from work from home policies and taking time off / emergency days, so we pretty took turns staying home with one child or both children. How do working families who don't have backup plans / caregivers manage?
At the beginning, it sort of felt like I was starting at a new school in the middle of the school year; I had a lot to learn and a lot of faces and names to remember. I still have a lot to learn and faces and names to remember, but it feels like I'm making an impact. I'm also thankful that I enjoy my work, so it's easy to wake up earlier and rush out the door.
We will have to find a different routine come summer, but so far, it's been working out just perfectly. I'm glad I scaled back my hours (before signing the offer) because it turns out if you're driving a car for school pick-up, you pretty much have to arrive in the neighbourhood at least 20 minutes early in order to find available street parking around the perimeter of the school; otherwise, you're pretty much out of luck. And even though I get off at 2:30PM, by the time I get everyone home, it's 4PM. I then give them a small snack, work on unloading the dishwasher and getting another load in, and starting supper. By the time we are done dinner, it's close to 7PM, and we play a bit then bathe (if applicable), and then off to bed. After that, I clean up the kitchen (pack food away, prep lunches) and maybe wash or fold the laundry. I've been doing laundry on weekends in loads, so I can just sit and binge-watch Netflix (working through The Crown) while folding.
Surprisingly, I find myself dozing off before midnight and using the computer less after work (but still on my phone) - maybe it's because I no longer have mid-day naps or work is more tiring than staying at home (though I feel it's a break / nice change from home life). I'm on a modified work week, and I'm already wondering how full-time working parents do this every day and survive? I applaud those families!
Other than work and school, we started going to a different small group / life group, which has changed to an earlier start time, which means for the first time in a long time, we actually get to stay past dinner. We have also started going to another church, primarily because Bean is at an age where she is learning, and I simply can't go on teaching her every week - and when I don't, I hear implied comments about going to a different church anyway. I'm a little sad, but since I also miss fellowship time because I'm watching them after service is over while everyone else is chatting and because people don't tend to eat together for lunch as much anymore, I'm not really connecting with anyone either. I know Bean misses it because on occasion, she tells me she wants to go back to Simply, or that she wants me to be her teacher that day, and every time we pass by St. Paul's, she points out that it's our church. Finding a new church to call home is hard. Personally, I don't like the format of the sermons by the lead pastor at this new church so far (grossly paraphrased: partial verses are taken from different translations to fit into the sermon's points) though the supporting pastor actually goes into a passage in contrast, but the kids seem to have adjusted so well even at the first visit and a lot of effort is put into the children's spiritual wellbeing and education. So yes, 2018 is going to be a year of change and adjustment.


<hr />
Two years ago, we were celebrating <a href="http://her.happyhippos.ca/2016/02/two-month-milestones/">two month milestones</a>. Now, at 2, he&#8217;s come a long way:


<ul>
    

<li>Speaks in complete sentences. Has started to communicate (and copy) in English. Boo.</li>


    

<li>Enjoys climbing and doing crazy things and will deliberately test boundaries with people in authority (me &#8211; he&#8217;s heavy so I can&#8217;t just pick him up and grab him while grocery shopping for example, so I don&#8217;t go when I&#8217;m on my own as it&#8217;s impossible to get more than one or two things in one trip)</li>


    

<li>Loves to sing, and can sing many songs in English including the Alphabet song, Twinkle Twinkle Little Star, Away in the Manger, Roly Poly and can sing along with or recognize songs by Walk Off the Earth, Moana, and Frozen.</li>


    

<li>Loves trains, especially Thomas. And cars. And airplanes. Prefers trains though, if given a choice.</li>


    

<li>Easily sucked in by technology: photos on the phone, TV, iPad game, and YouTube videos. One time early on, the caregiver gave an older child a tablet to use while the younger ones were supposed to nap; he had a meltdown and refused to sleep. Then she figured out why (we had warned her prior so she made the connection and no more problems since).</li>


    

<li>Has not completely weaned. So, I&#8217;m still off dairy and some nuts. Nuts!</li>


    

<li>While he started off with liking meat, he doesn&#8217;t seem to like meat (fish the exception) as much anymore, unless it&#8217;s chicken nuggets/fingers/crispy. He will still eat it but when it is in chunks, he tends to pick it out. He also doesn&#8217;t like green fiber veggies, but will repeatedly down it in smoothie form. Like his sister, he loves fruit. Avocados, bananas, and cereal with alternative milk are now his favourite breakfast foods. He is a soup and rice monster. Sometimes noodles too.</li>


    

<li>Self-toilet training is hit and miss so far &#8211; and if successful, it&#8217;s still only #2 (though a few times, he wakes up with a dry diaper and will go if you put him on the toilet); progress seems to have slowed down or regressed especially now that he doesn&#8217;t tell his caregiver he needs to go (or maybe she hasn&#8217;t learned the signs yet)</li>


    

<li>He may have had a mini <a href="http://her.happyhippos.ca/2017/04/the-day-we-had-our-first-ambulance-ride/">febrile seizure</a> the other week, when he had a slight fever (while fighting off strange rashes &#8211; maybe mild symptoms of hand, foot, mouth + reaction to lactose in Tylenol) but it lasted no more than a few seconds and it was in his sleep.</li>


    

<li>He seems interested in people he knows (and babies) &#8211; often willing to share a toy, asking for someone by name, offering hugs to those he loves (except it&#8217;s sad to see hugs not reciprocated, especially when his sister comes out from dance class and he goes to hug her and she brushes him off; however, she always asks to go into timeout with him when he&#8217;s in trouble), and enjoys helping out in the kitchen (putting dishes away, watching and helping mommy cook/bake)</li>


    

<li>He must have shorter legs or something, because he fits his age in tops when it comes to sizing but his bottoms are behind a bit.</li>


</ul>


I&#8217;m amazed at how fast our children is growing up, now that we all have slightly different routines and that they are no longer babies.]]&gt;		</p>
