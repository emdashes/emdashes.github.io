<p class="has-drop-cap">I have been mentoring and praying for a new grad who has been trying to start her career in UX. One evening, during my time catching up on my Bible reading and praying, I felt God telling (not really with a voice, more like a nudging feeling) that maybe by having left (which was a tough decision for me), it created an opportunity for my friend. Sure, a new role may have eventually been posted, but the timing was probably expedited by another coworker&#8217;s subsequent departure as well. All along her hiring process, we both patiently waited &#8211; her for news, and I to see how the story unfolded! I couldn&#8217;t say with certainty, &#8220;hey, God told me you&#8217;ll get the job &#8211; you&#8217;ll see&#8221; even after seeing that it wasn&#8217;t the right fit for two other applicants who interviewed as well (yes, I knew those people too &#8211; so it felt like I was just watching a movie as the outside perspective looking in).</p>



<p class="has-background has-very-light-gray-background-color">This verse holds true time and time again: <br><em>&#8220;Trust in the LORD with all your heart and lean not on your understanding; in all your ways, acknowledge Him and He will make your path straight.&#8221;  Proverbs 3:5-6</em></p>



<p>Now I&#8217;m intrigued at what&#8217;s in store for me next &#8211; so far, I didn&#8217;t really actively apply to any role -they all sort of happened (update: with the exception of this latest one &#8211; and God turned a &#8220;not possible&#8221; to an offer!). There <del>are</del>were a couple of possibilities I&#8217;m praying through, but at this point, I have the luxury of not having to worry about experience on my resume as much or needing to rely on my income to meet my family&#8217;s needs.</p>



<hr>



<p>In the past year, more people have asked me how I got into UX (user experience). I&#8217;ve told a version of my story to a few people, but it&#8217;s really all God &#8211; really, it&#8217;s been great!  路  Let&#8217;s go back in time&#8230;<br></p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">So my first visit to the optometrist in Grade 9 changed my life. After seeing Dr. Stephanie, I was determined to become an optometrist, to help improve people&#8217;s lives by helping them to see better (perhaps this explains I had kept a colouring book (by Unicef?) around that talked about a possum who went to developing countries to help those with cataracts see again). Research skills kicked in soon after and my academic and career path was set for Waterloo (the only optometry school in Canada that is taught in English; McGill being the other), or so I thought.</p>



<p>I had 3.5 years to prepare myself, my family, and my friends that I was moving to a brand new province, without really knowing anyone there. Well, except I had met the English pastor at the local Chinese church at a conference in Regina a couple years earlier, who had then told me nope, I wasn&#8217;t going to make it into Optometry (of course, I didn&#8217;t listen to a stranger&#8217;s assessment of me!). </p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Eventually however, I ditched optometry in favour of RPW (rhetoric professional writing), <a href="https://her.happyhippos.ca/2006/01/1999-2000-year-two/">switching with relative ease</a>. A friend once astutely pointed out that the seeing metaphor is a theme that carries through this story.  I wanted to become a technical writer; I wanted to write documentation in a way that would be easily understood, and change the way people saw manuals, instead of boring, hard-to-understand, and something to read/consult only as a last resort (to fix a mistake). A couple of courses in information design toward the end of my degree really piqued my interest in UX. I ended up as a technical writer, marketing writer, and finally as a internet content writer (which overlaps with UX writing these days), before I ended up exploring the user researcher vs. interaction designer path. But while I expressed interest in interaction design, I wasn&#8217;t given a UX role until another leader in a different department randomly offered me an opportunity as a project coordinator. Yes, all of this happened by &#8220;accident&#8221;!</p>



<p class="has-background has-very-light-gray-background-color">Looking back, it seems like I&#8217;ve been interested in UX before the term became popular. And since I don&#8217;t believe in coincidences, I see God&#8217;s timing and hand in everything!</p>



<p>Almost 9 years later, I was essentially laid off at the beginning of my maternity leave (they cut my team and position but generously retained me until my mat leave was over). I had intended to quit to be a full-time parent at the end of it anyway, but here was God showing up again, and giving me a really awesome gift: the gift of a year&#8217;s worth of continued benefits and little extra cash to start a new chapter of life.</p>



<p class="has-text-color has-background has-very-dark-gray-color has-very-light-gray-background-color">One day, my friend sent me this message, &#8220;Would you be interested in ux design work?&#8221; My response, &#8220;part-time definitely!&#8221;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Expecting that it was the end of my career (I called it career suicide) when I became a stay-at-home parent, God had other plans when I wasn&#8217;t looking, and gave me a part-time contract in UX that I did mostly remote, with the occasional on-site visit. Contract work became relevant work, because shortly after that, a friend reached out to me (above). I actually expected a no as I&#8217;ve come to expect that local tech companies want someone full-time. But, this <a href="https://her.happyhippos.ca/2017/12/wrapping-up-2017/">kick-started a whole new adventure</a>! </p>



<p>Within a very short time, I slapped together a (terrible) portfolio that was graciously reviewed by a friend who had more experience, recognized the design challenge as being one I had reviewed in detail on the internet prior, but feeling like I didn&#8217;t complete fully complete it and thought I failed the interview, and then somehow ended up with my ideal during-school-hours schedule (with a few full-days here and there) doing interesting work!</p>



<p class="has-background has-very-light-gray-background-color">During my interview before I was hired, I asked what a successful or effective UX Designer would look like in the role, and the answers were &#8220;user research&#8221;, &#8220;testing&#8221;, &#8220;validation&#8221;, &#8220;success metrics&#8221;; so, it’s hardly a surprise that I ended up doing 80% UX research (practice and strategy) and 20% UX design there.</p>



<p>At the start of this year, a bunch of things happened at work, which led to some restructuring and my role changed: 80% of what I was hired to do was taken away. And because I&#8217;m huge on the U in UX, it wasn&#8217;t the right fit anymore so I eventually decided to leave. Actually, I surprised myself, because I&#8217;m usually not one to quit that easily, but it was oddly freeing, and it was good timing, really good timing &#8211; I was able to spend the next few weeks with my sister and her family, and vacation in Orlando after that! Seeing and being on God&#8217;s path is pretty amazing <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				Less than a month ago, I shared a story on Facebook about how we (I) lost (dropped) Bean&#8217;s glove on our walk home from school. If you missed it, I&#8217;ve included it here &#8211; and if you&#8217;ve read it already, read on:</p>
<blockquote><p>When short prayers get answered quickly:<br />
Along our walk home today, I discovered that we lost a Kombi mitt. We retraced our steps back to school and even checked the lost and found without it turning up.<br />
As we were heading back, I told Bean that we should pray about it and ask God for help in returning it. Why of course, just as we leave from the school yard, I see a pink mitt standing tall on a wire-fence post near a tree. Some kind soul must have put it there in hopes it would be reunited with its other half. Yet, I had missed seeing that when we had first entered the school yard even though it was completely in my line of sight!</p></blockquote>
<p>This week, Bean went on a class field trip to a grocery store within walking distance. The teachers had asked them to put their mitts inside the sleeves of their jackets so they wouldn&#8217;t lose it. Sometime between the trip and the day of the school day, one of her pink Kombi mitts went missing, again!<br />
No, it wasn&#8217;t in her sleeves, not in the lost and found at Sobeys or at the school, wasn&#8217;t in her cubby, and it didn&#8217;t reappear by the end of the next day. By the third day, as I was getting out of the car to pick her up, I sort of mumbled a quick prayer, hoping for a miracle because I liked these much more than the hot paws we had. I even thought about retracing the steps they took, but when I saw her, she happily waved her two hands, with <i>both </i>Kombi mitts on them! <i>Answered prayers!</i><br />
Although she couldn&#8217;t quite tell me where she found them initially, she then told me she found it in her cubby; her teacher told me she had emptied her cubby and looked multiple times without seeing anything. Later on, Bean tells me what sounds a tall tale (but more likely a true one from her perspective that looks drastically different to an adult): that her mitt was hanging above her cubby from the ceiling and she had to take a block as a stool to stand up to reach it.<br />
Stranger things have happened (e.g. me finding a lost wedding ring in grass; a lost diamond in a car trunk) [ref] this is all connected to one of my first summer camp experiences where a camp counsellor-later turned pastor told us a story about how he couldn&#8217;t find his keys, so he knelt down and prayed and as soon as he was done, God opened his eyes and it was somehow right in front of him; he didn&#8217;t know how he could&#8217;ve missed it before! This story has stuck with me and has empowered me to pray, especially when things are lost [/ref], so this is just one of the many times where God shows up in the little things! (Still missing the wallet with $400US so not all prayers get answered with a yes right away).		</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				That&#8217;s our office cat in the photo. I&#8217;m one month in. And yet, it feels like a lot longer than that. I&#8217;ve found a rhythm that works with this new routine, and I&#8217;m thankful that both our kids have adjusted well too. Consequently, we transitioned our oldest to full day kindergarten, and after some trial and error, we dropped her afternoon nap, we eat dinner earlier, and they go to sleep earlier. Unfortunately, our youngest still wakes up at night and asks for food then, but our oldest seems to fall asleep faster and stays asleep throughout the night for the most part. This week has been one of the few germ-free weeks this year, so it&#8217;s a nice relief to not have to deal with that (if it wasn&#8217;t him, it was her, and if it wasn&#8217;t either of them, it was us or our daycare) &#8211; I&#8217;m grateful that our workplaces are pretty flexible when it comes from work from home policies and taking time off / emergency days, so we pretty took turns staying home with one child or both children. How do working families who don&#8217;t have backup plans / caregivers manage?<br />
At the beginning, it sort of felt like I was starting at a new school in the middle of the school year; I had a lot to learn and a lot of faces and names to remember. I still have a lot to learn and faces and names to remember, but it feels like I&#8217;m making an impact. I&#8217;m also thankful that I enjoy my work, so it&#8217;s easy to wake up earlier and rush out the door.<br />
We will have to find a different routine come summer, but so far, it&#8217;s been working out just perfectly. I&#8217;m glad I scaled back my hours (before signing the offer) because it turns out if you&#8217;re driving a car for school pick-up, you pretty much have to arrive in the neighbourhood at least 20 minutes early in order to find available street parking around the perimeter of the school; otherwise, you&#8217;re pretty much out of luck. And even though I get off at 2:30PM, by the time I get everyone home, it&#8217;s 4PM. I then give them a small snack, work on unloading the dishwasher and getting another load in, and starting supper. By the time we are done dinner, it&#8217;s close to 7PM, and we play a bit then bathe (if applicable), and then off to bed. After that, I clean up the kitchen (pack food away, prep lunches) and maybe wash or fold the laundry. I&#8217;ve been doing laundry on weekends in loads, so I can just sit and binge-watch Netflix (working through The Crown) while folding.<br />
Surprisingly, I find myself dozing off before midnight and using the computer less after work (but still on my phone) &#8211; maybe it&#8217;s because I no longer have mid-day naps or work is more tiring than staying at home (though I feel it&#8217;s a break / nice change from home life). I&#8217;m on a modified work week, and I&#8217;m already wondering how full-time working parents do this every day and survive? I applaud those families!<br />
Other than work and school, we started going to a different small group / life group, which has changed to an earlier start time, which means for the first time in a long time, we actually get to stay past dinner. We have also started going to another church, primarily because Bean is at an age where she is learning, and I simply can&#8217;t go on teaching her every week &#8211; and when I don&#8217;t, I hear implied comments about going to a different church anyway. I&#8217;m a little sad, but since I also miss fellowship time because I&#8217;m watching them after service is over while everyone else is chatting and because people don&#8217;t tend to eat together for lunch as much anymore, I&#8217;m not really connecting with anyone either. I know Bean misses it because on occasion, she tells me she wants to go back to Simply, or that she wants me to be her teacher that day, and every time we pass by St. Paul&#8217;s, she points out that it&#8217;s our church. Finding a new church to call home is hard. Personally, I don&#8217;t like the format of the sermons by the lead pastor at this new church so far (grossly paraphrased: partial verses are taken from different translations to fit into the sermon&#8217;s points) though the supporting pastor actually goes into a passage in contrast, but the kids seem to have adjusted so well even at the first visit and a lot of effort is put into the children&#8217;s spiritual wellbeing and education. So yes, 2018 is going to be a year of change and adjustment.</p>
<hr />
Two years ago, we were celebrating <a href="http://her.happyhippos.ca/2016/02/two-month-milestones/">two month milestones</a>. Now, at 2, he&#8217;s come a long way:</p>
<ul>
<li>Speaks in complete sentences. Has started to communicate (and copy) in English. Boo.</li>
<li>Enjoys climbing and doing crazy things and will deliberately test boundaries with people in authority (me &#8211; he&#8217;s heavy so I can&#8217;t just pick him up and grab him while grocery shopping for example, so I don&#8217;t go when I&#8217;m on my own as it&#8217;s impossible to get more than one or two things in one trip)</li>
<li>Loves to sing, and can sing many songs in English including the Alphabet song, Twinkle Twinkle Little Star, Away in the Manger, Roly Poly and can sing along with or recognize songs by Walk Off the Earth, Moana, and Frozen.</li>
<li>Loves trains, especially Thomas. And cars. And airplanes. Prefers trains though, if given a choice.</li>
<li>Easily sucked in by technology: photos on the phone, TV, iPad game, and YouTube videos. One time early on, the caregiver gave an older child a tablet to use while the younger ones were supposed to nap; he had a meltdown and refused to sleep. Then she figured out why (we had warned her prior so she made the connection and no more problems since).</li>
<li>Has not completely weaned. So, I&#8217;m still off dairy and some nuts. Nuts!</li>
<li>While he started off with liking meat, he doesn&#8217;t seem to like meat (fish the exception) as much anymore, unless it&#8217;s chicken nuggets/fingers/crispy. He will still eat it but when it is in chunks, he tends to pick it out. He also doesn&#8217;t like green fiber veggies, but will repeatedly down it in smoothie form. Like his sister, he loves fruit. Avocados, bananas, and cereal with alternative milk are now his favourite breakfast foods. He is a soup and rice monster. Sometimes noodles too.</li>
<li>Self-toilet training is hit and miss so far &#8211; and if successful, it&#8217;s still only #2 (though a few times, he wakes up with a dry diaper and will go if you put him on the toilet); progress seems to have slowed down or regressed especially now that he doesn&#8217;t tell his caregiver he needs to go (or maybe she hasn&#8217;t learned the signs yet)</li>
<li>He may have had a mini <a href="http://her.happyhippos.ca/2017/04/the-day-we-had-our-first-ambulance-ride/">febrile seizure</a> the other week, when he had a slight fever (while fighting off strange rashes &#8211; maybe mild symptoms of hand, foot, mouth + reaction to lactose in Tylenol) but it lasted no more than a few seconds and it was in his sleep.</li>
<li>He seems interested in people he knows (and babies) &#8211; often willing to share a toy, asking for someone by name, offering hugs to those he loves (except it&#8217;s sad to see hugs not reciprocated, especially when his sister comes out from dance class and he goes to hug her and she brushes him off; however, she always asks to go into timeout with him when he&#8217;s in trouble), and enjoys helping out in the kitchen (putting dishes away, watching and helping mommy cook/bake)</li>
<li>He must have shorter legs or something, because he fits his age in tops when it comes to sizing but his bottoms are behind a bit.</li>
</ul>
<p>I&#8217;m amazed at how fast our children is growing up, now that we all have slightly different routines and that they are no longer babies.		</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				If you had asked me at the beginning of this year, or even at the beginning of last month where I&#8217;d be by the end of the year, I would have said, &#8220;same old&#8221;; yet, 2017, turned out to be quite the year of the new and unexpected:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://her.happyhippos.ca/2017/01/we-are-one-of-those-families/">Confirmed allergies; dietary changes</a></li>
<li><a href="http://her.happyhippos.ca/2017/04/the-day-we-had-our-first-ambulance-ride/">Seizure scare resulting in a trip to the hospital via ambulance</a></li>
<li><a href="http://her.happyhippos.ca/2017/07/first-solo-trip-with-two/">Travelling as a solo-parent with two</a> to Vancouver, then hosting my sister who travelled as a solo-parent with two</li>
<li>Getting Ready for School programs and <a href="http://her.happyhippos.ca/2017/09/kindergarten-101/">starting school</a> meant a change in routines and expectations</li>
<li><a href="http://her.happyhippos.ca/2017/12/maui-back-in-time/">Vacationing in Mau</a>i and then <a href="http://her.happyhippos.ca/2017/12/orlando-with-young-kids/">in Orlando</a></li>
<li>Ending the year as a stay-at-home mom and transitioning to a working mom in 2018!</li>
</ul>
<p>Being a stay-at-home mom was God&#8217;s gift: I see it as being paid to leave at the end of my first maternity leave. This upcoming job? Also God&#8217;s gift &#8211; here&#8217;s why:</p>
<ul>
<li>I had not been actively applying for jobs [ref]I had actually resigned to giving up my career (I&#8217;ve labelled it &#8220;career suicide&#8221;) and had expected to stay at home until the youngest was at school at minimum, and then finding part-time or casual work during school hours, probably in a different field[/ref]. Once or twice a year, I get asked and consider going back to work but I&#8217;ve always declined due to the number of hours (I didn&#8217;t want a 40 hour work week; I want to be home when the kids are off school) but the past few months have been a perfect set-up for this&#8230;</li>
<li>I had not been actively applying for jobs. Yet, in the spring, a friend asked me if I was interested in doing consulting work for them; it was ideal: part-time hours, mostly at night after kids&#8217; bedtimes, and my in-laws gave us childcare support during the few on-site visits! Turns out, recent work became relevant work.</li>
<li>When our oldest started school, our youngest lost his playing companion and he suddenly demanded more of my attention (ie. companionship); he also wanted to go out, just like his sister did. So, I turned to the <a href="https://www.sapcrc.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Parent-Child Resource Center at our local Salvation Army</a>, and enrolled in programs three days a week, so that he would have something to do in the mornings. They were (are) amazing: my in-laws&#8217; church nursery couldn&#8217;t calm him down but they did within a short time on the first day, though it took him 3 weeks to stop crying at drop-off and pick-up. Now, even though he initially protests, I know he can be happy in someone else&#8217;s care.</li>
<li>Timing: I have been picking up a friend&#8217;s daughter from Montessori and dropping her off at the sitter once a week, but it just happens that the mom&#8217;s schedule is changing in January, so I don&#8217;t have to do that anymore.</li>
<li>I had not been actively applying for jobs. Somehow, between Maui to Orlando (within a month), I was offered a job.</li>
<li>I had not been actively applying for jobs. I hadn&#8217;t interviewed for at least 7 years, so I&#8217;m not exactly well-practised. I went through a few rounds of interviews, and by the second round, I actually expected to walk away for good, as my interview ended early; I felt that I could have given better answers (instead of what I felt were vague) and I did not complete a 20-minute design challenge in time or thoroughly (what happened to navigation?!). I also didn&#8217;t have a portfolio ready until interviews started!</li>
<li>I had not been actively applying for jobs. Yet, this company had an opening for a permanent position (advertised) &#8211; doing what I enjoy &#8211; at reduced hours (unadvertised), which lets me get off in time to pick up the kids from school &#8211; how awesome is that?!</li>
<li>Interesting tidbit: my first job was at a GIS company with under 50 employees; this job is at a GIS company with about the same number.</li>
</ul>
<p>We just need to find childcare now, but if God has provided all of this, I&#8217;m certain we will be in good hands!		</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				And, I hope it will be our last, and I hope this will the first and last time I have to call 911 for an emergency response. Come to think of it, that was his first time at a hospital too, since he was <a href="http://her.happyhippos.ca/2015/12/its-another-baby/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">born at home</a>.<br />
A couple of evenings ago, our little one had a <a href="http://kidshealth.org/en/parents/febrile.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">febrile seizure</a>. I didn&#8217;t know that was the name of it at the time, but I had two fleeting thoughts: &#8211; what was it that I read about seizures in young children during illness &#8211; was this it or something else? and &#8211; I hope I don&#8217;t have to ask for our hand-me-down baby clothes back. During the episode, I felt so helpless watching his limbs twitch, his eyes roll back repeatedly, and his lips turn blue. Shortly after we laid him down on the floor, during the call with dispatch, the seizure stopped but his eyes looked glassy, his gaze off in the distance; he fell asleep despite us talking to him and he didn&#8217;t even notice his sister jumping to get his attention. I cheered inside every time his chest rose up and then down, confirming that he was still breathing.<br />
And for those wondering:</p>
<h3>What was the ambulance ride like?</h3>
<p>The inside of an ambulance is surprisingly spacious, with ample room to seat at least 5 passengers with seat belts, and there&#8217;s a <a href="http://www.fernoems.com/en/search-results/pedi-mate.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">child-restraint system</a> for ambulance cots! Though, with rather limited windows and with the small view whizzing by when I tried to look out to see whether we were, I found myself getting a bit motion sick. We were the first call on their shift. As the ambulance door closed, I could only offer a weak smile to the neighbour who walked out to see what was going on (I found out later, they asked j.w if everything was okay and invited them over and offered to babysit if needed). If the $45 ambulance bill is not covered by OHIP or extended health, it&#8217;s a fairly reasonable cost: $755 cheaper than having a fire truck come on scene, and $35 cheaper than for one in our area in BC.</p>
<h3>What happened at the hospital?</h3>
<p>We were placed in our own room with a bed to rest on in the acute care department of the emergency ward  &#8211; I guess that&#8217;s one advantage of arriving via ambulance: <a href="http://www.grhosp.on.ca/care/services-departments/emergency/current-emergency-wait" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">you don&#8217;t have to sit in the waiting area</a> and deal with triage directly. His temperature was noted at 38.8C (which isn&#8217;t the highest it&#8217;s been). One of the paramedics instructed me to put him on the bed and wanted me to stand or sit in the chair, but thankfully, the nurses let me pick him up, which calmed him down (and kept him from falling off the bed!). For the most part, he wasn&#8217;t too miserable &#8211; I mean, you&#8217;d feel uncomfortable and probably want to cry too if they poked you, put you in some confining <a href="http://www.piggostat.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">x-ray contraption</a>, and put a catheter in you. The blood work showed low bicarbonate which may be related to his crazy <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f4a9.png" alt="💩" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> episodes in the past couple of days (diarrhea, the doctor thinks), and chest X-rays suggest something viral in the chest, possibly early pneumonia, which might have been from his cold a couple weeks back and could explain the wet cough they overheard. The doctor consulted the pediatrician and decided that no antibiotics were needed at this time since he&#8217;s still himself, for the most part anyway (thankfully because antibiotics can cause a bunch of side effects including yeast infection in the diaper area &#8211; but I&#8217;ve supplemented with probiotics anyway since he had diarrhea). Pee dip test came out clear. Overall, we had a nice mother-son bonding time once I was given the okay to pick him up and hold him.<br />
Despite us having to wait 5 hours for tests and results to come back, and with little updates unless I asked, towards the end of the evening, a nurse held my son while she faced the other way in the washroom so I could relieve my relatively full bladder, and even gave me a sandwich, some juice, and some fruit for us to eat, when I asked where I could buy some food to fill our rather empty stomachs (the little guy promptly fell asleep once he satisfied his hunger)[ref]this episode happened just as we were sitting down to eat dinner so we missed it[/ref].<br />
Towards the later parts of the evening, one distressed and very vocal fellow ended up in the same ward as us. One of the nurses told me that on weekends/Saturdays especially, and during later parts of the night, they often see people who don&#8217;t know where they are, or are elsewhere mentally because they&#8217;re either drunk or on way too much drugs, and sadly, the many of the latter are young people.<br />
PT took us home as it was late by the time we left and j.w had stayed home with Bean. Since then, DS has symptoms of a cold in addition to the fever, which comes and goes.<br />
Overall, I am very pleased with the response rate and care that we received the other night by Grand River hospital and by the paramedics.</p>
<h3>What are we to watch for now?</h3>
<p>The doctor instructed me to bring him back if he had another seizure within 24 hours, if we see him have any difficulty breathing, or if the fever doesn&#8217;t dissipate within 5 days. I was also advised to make a follow-up appointment with our family doctor the next week. If we notice less wet diapers, she suggested 1:1 apple juice to water ratio as a cheaper and tastier but equally effective alternative to pedialyte.</p>
<h3>Will it happen again? Does it affect their development? Will they get epilepsy?</h3>
<p>Sadly, the chances of another febrile seizure happening in the future is 1 in 3 (33%) now that he has had one. Both the internet and the doctor tells me that it&#8217;s fairly common in young children in response to a fever past 38C and it doesn&#8217;t seem to harm them. Our relatively laid-back child now has both allergy and febrile seizure risks (to balance out his easy-going nature?).  His chance of developing epilepsy according to the doctor is double, moving from 1% to 2%, which is still quite low: it won&#8217;t happen 98% of the time.</p>
<h3>What happened before all this started?</h3>
<p>Before the seizure, he seemed like his usual self, though he has seemed sad after every time he soiled his diaper for the past day or so (every one was was poopy) especially when I asked him about it, and he vomited once while crying on the toilet (I thought it was from crying, not from being sick). He hadn&#8217;t quite shaken his cough from a couple weeks back, but it didn&#8217;t seem to bother him and it was only on occasion, so I thought it was just residual coughing. He was maybe a touch warmer than usual, but I&#8217;m usually able to tell if he has a fever just by feel, so I&#8217;m not sure why I didn&#8217;t notice it; it probably didn&#8217;t help that he was wearing a wool cardigan. He woke up from his late nap after being transferred to j.w so I could make dinner, and shortly after j.w put him in the high chair, I heard, &#8220;I think he&#8217;s having a seizure&#8221;. I suggested moving him onto the ground (which the doctor assured me that was the right thing to do), called 911 since it was his first time and we weren&#8217;t sure what to do &#8211; I figured I could use the verbal coaching if I needed to do infant/baby/child CPR. He definitely felt and looked a lot hotter by the time the seizure stopped and woke up crying.</p>
<h3>What to expect if it happens again in your care?</h3>
<p>Start timing it &#8211; it&#8217;s probably going to feel longer than how much time has actually passed. Falling asleep is normal as long as breathing is happening, and as long as he is responsive and &#8220;comes out of it&#8221; within an hour of happening, it&#8217;s really nothing to be concerned about[ref]I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;m going to be concerned every time it happens anyway[/ref]. Put him down on the floor and turn his head to side in case he vomits. If the seizure continues for more than 4 minutes, call 911. If it doesn&#8217;t last for more than 10 minutes, we don&#8217;t need to bring him in to be assessed but since it takes a few minutes for the ambulance to come, preemptively calling them after 4 minutes is okay.  Paramedics advised us to strip him down to diaper to bring down his temperature as well. The pamphlet the hospital gave us also told us not to put him in a bath to bring down his temperature and don&#8217;t put anything in their mouths; they will not swallow their tongue. If he&#8217;s feverish, give him the correct dosage of Tylenol / Advil to avoid peaking over 38C.</p>
<h3>P.S. As usual, God&#8217;s fingerprint was all over this.</h3>
<p>He prepared me for this in two ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>I was supposed to be out that evening watching a movie with a friend but because I forgot to arrange the logistics with j.w (dinner, rides, car, etc.) and because the kids were still napping past the time, I missed it.</li>
<li>I have been on a long wait list for a LTE WiFi hotspot router from the library. My hold finally came up the day before this happened and j.w managed to pick it up for me. I was thinking, &#8220;I&#8217;m not going anywhere this week, why would I need internet on the go?&#8221; Well, he thought to throw it into my hospital bag as I was rushing out, and thankfully I had it because I wouldn&#8217;t have paid $10 for internet for the 5 hours that we were there. It enabled me to keep family and friends up-to-date, and I was encouraged to learn that so many were praying for us &#8211; and asking if we needed any help! Thank you, as always 🙂</li>
</ol>
<p>I pray we won&#8217;t experience this again, but if it does happen, at least I know what to expect -sort of; I feel one can never be &#8220;ready enough&#8221; to get married, to get pregnant, to have kids, and now to parent, but I know I&#8217;m never alone in this journey.		</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				Today marks the end of steamed milk in my coffee, grilled cheese sandwiches, peanut butter pretzels and buttered popcorn, yogurt, ice cream, and other products containing milk, possibly soy, and peanuts in my diet until the end of our breastfeeding days, which&nbsp;might be for another year or more. While I only have to endure it until the end of our breastfeeding time together, our little one might have to watch his diet for the rest of his life &#8211; I&#8217;m sad for him, but at least he won&#8217;t have memories of enjoying those, so he may have less cravings for them, and hopefully better self-control (than I do!)[ref]I didn&#8217;t realize how much I regularly enjoy milk products until now, even though I don&#8217;t care for milk itself[/ref].&nbsp;<br />
I once suspected that milk might have been the culprit in his&nbsp;bouts of eczema and bloody stools[ref]though the latter might still be as a result of constipation[/ref], when he was known to spit up after every feeding (I would say mild reflux), and experienced three vomiting episodes after eating one serving of rice cereal that contained milk ingredients, but I was in denial; how could it be? My daily diet only consisted of milk in my one cup of espresso &#8211; or so I thought; I forgot about the cheese, ice cream, butter, everything else that has milk protein in it. I&#8217;m pretty sure I was in denial, so I didn&#8217;t&nbsp;cut anything in my diet, thinking that it wasn&#8217;t really an allergy, and like his sister, would outgrow it. Now, after a visit to an allergist and a positive prick/rash/allergy test, it&#8217;s official: he&nbsp;has a milk and peanut&nbsp;allergy.<br />
So now, our low-maintenance baby has become a high-maintenance one; I guess our &#8220;easy&#8221; baby was too good to be true. Yet, this news comes at a timely moment in our lives; we&#8217;re reading through&nbsp;<em>The Power of a Praying Parent</em> by Stormie Omartian (I keep thinking it&#8217;s &#8220;O&#8217;Martian&#8221;), and we just covered a chapter that talks about releasing our children to God, and this is an example of a very much an appropriate moment to follow her model of prayer: that if it&#8217;s in His will and in His time, that our son will outgrow both his allergies; but&nbsp;if not, will be managed well so that no one would ever need to use an epipen on him; but if so, that it is administered successfully and effectively.<br />
I&#8217;m still processing the news, so I didn&#8217;t get a chance to think of and ask the many follow-up questions that have since popped up (stemming from online research and what others have shared with me &#8211; yep, I&#8217;m also one of those internet moms), but here are some questions that people have asked and the answers I have come across:<br />
<strong>Q. Will he outgrow his&nbsp;allergy?<br />
A.&nbsp;</strong><a href="http://aacijournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1710-1492-7-S1-S7#Sec12" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Possibly</a>. Our allergist says that many children outgrow their milk allergy by the age of 5. I just found out&nbsp;that my siblings and I all had milk allergies until we were 1 years old, and our mother experimented by trying to reintroduce milk slowly and over time. However, only 20% of kids outgrow their peanut allergy. Because Bean seemed to have a milder reaction to peanut butter when she was younger, but outgrew it by 2 years old &#8211; which surprised him, the allergist suggested paying for a blood test to see if her brother&nbsp;would qualify for reintroduction of peanuts under clinical supervision; we&#8217;re praying that&nbsp;he&#8217;d be eligible. So, as of now, it is what it is &#8211; will just have to adapt to manage it.<br />
<strong>Q. How severe is his allergy?<br />
A.</strong> At the skin prick test, the one for peanuts was about 5mm, and the one for milk was slightly larger (6mm, maybe?); I think&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15482519" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the size indicates a positive diagnosi</a>s,&nbsp;but I didn&#8217;t think to ask. According to one site,&nbsp;&#8220;<a href="http://www.kidswithfoodallergies.org/page/food-allergy-test-diagnosis-skin-prick-blood.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">no test [&#8230;] can determine severity</a>&#8220;. Nevertheless,&nbsp;we&#8217;ve been advised to keep two epipens with him. While, I don&#8217;t know the criteria for what makes an allergy a risk for anaphylaxis, we have&nbsp;seen <a href="http://aacijournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1710-1492-7-S1-S6#Sec4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">symptoms matching the criteria in Table 3, section 2 (GI and skin symptoms)</a>&nbsp;and <a href="http://aacijournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1710-1492-7-S1-S6#Sec3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">in this table</a>.<br />
The allergist&nbsp;prescribed two injectors (<a href="http://www.kidswithfoodallergies.org/page/newly-diagnosed.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">as does this site</a>), but I think&nbsp;most people I know only carry one. Although he does not meet <a href="http://aacijournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1710-1492-10-40" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the minimum recommended weight of 15 KG (33 LBs)</a>, the allergist still recommended that over a self-administered antidote citing that human / user error is very common. He then used an ultrasound machine to measure the thickness of muscle between the skin and the bone, to make sure that our son&#8217;s thighs is fat enough &#8211; more than 13mm &#8211; <a href="http://aacijournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1710-1492-10-40#Sec2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">so that the injection won&#8217;t hit bone</a> (and bone marrow, which is equivalent to a IV administration and that&#8217;s bad); he was 16mm. Another option is available (TwinJet?) but is supposedly the same dose.<br />
<strong>Q. Is there no other option other than Epipen? What about Benadryl?</strong><br />
<strong>A. </strong>The allergist and online sources tells me that&nbsp;Benadryl won&#8217;t help with breathing, but it may help reduce other symptoms (e.g. puffy eyes, lips).<br />
<strong>Q. What can he drink instead of milk, to get the fat content and other nutrients that is in whole milk?<br />
A.&nbsp;</strong>My dietician and online sources say that breastmilk is best so to keep breastfeeding for as long as possible. As long as we have the go ahead to eat soy, we can also have soy and coconut milk; there&#8217;s rice and almond milk as well. I&#8217;ve tried hemp milk, and it tastes like grassy straw, which I&#8217;m not a fan of at all. Fortified alternatives provide at least 30% calcium and some fat content, but it doesn&#8217;t completely replace milk&#8217;s benefits; it&#8217;s also a shame that many companies use carrageenan (or xanthan gum, but not as bad) to thicken their drink, and add sea salt to flavour it. I have to remember to continue to supplement him with Vitamin D. For good fat, I will likely have to be more creative, using oils like avocado or olive, and serving more salmon (frozen filet steaks of wild Alaskan salmon is readily available from Kirkland / Costco year-round, works out to be 10$/lb which is reasonable)<br />
<strong>Q. What about formula?<br />
A.&nbsp;</strong>Online sources seem to suggest that if a baby has a milk allergy, baby may have a higher likelihood of developing a soy allergy, so switching to a soy based formula may end up increasing the risk.<br />
<strong>Q. Can he have lactose-free, cheese, or yogurt? What about goat&#8217;s or sheep&#8217;s milk?<br />
A.&nbsp;</strong>Unfortunately, the allergy is to the milk protein, not the lactose. Most people with milk allergy is to cow&#8217;s milk protein, but I&#8217;m not sure if we have the go-ahead to try other kinds of dairy.<br />
I did mention that I had accidentally fed him vegetables cooked in butter a couple of times and failed to see a reaction, to which he was surprised, so as a result, he told me keep to doing it, but don&#8217;t go beyond what I normally would have done. We will likely have to monitor him very, very closely if we do that &#8211; not to mention, we&#8217;ll have to watch&nbsp;him even more closely when we aren&#8217;t the ones providing his meal / food. Though, I wonder if he&nbsp;can tolerate <a href="https://aacijournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1710-1492-8-5#Sec1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">extreme heated milk products</a>&nbsp;&#8211; will have to ask.<br />
<strong>Q. Can he have other nuts?</strong><br />
A. In theory, yes. Peanuts is technically a legume and not a tree nut (e.g walnut, pecan), but we have to be careful of cross contamination because they may be processed in facility that isn&#8217;t peanut free.<br />
<strong>Q. What about peanut oil?</strong><br />
<strong>A.</strong> I&#8217;m not sure about this one. Online sources say that pure unrefined peanut oil should be safe, but I need to check with the allergist about this one. Will likely have to avoid though,&nbsp;especially in commercial places, like restaurants &#8211; because can you be sure that it&#8217;s pure and unrefined?<br />
<strong>Q. So, are you a peanut and dairy-free household now?</strong><br />
<strong>A.</strong> Thankfully, complete elimination measures aren&#8217;t necessary at this time. In fact, the allergist told us specifically not to stop giving our daughter peanut butter! However,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.hamiltonhealthsciences.ca/documents/Patient%20Education/CowMilkProteinAllergyWhatToEatBreastfeeding-trh.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mom will also need to follow a similar elimination diet</a>, which will be a challenge, as she can&#8217;t eat anything from the allium family either (e.g garlic, onions, chives, leeks).<br />
<strong>Q.</strong> <strong>What can I do to help?</strong><br />
<strong>A.</strong> Pray for us &#8211; I (we) have no idea what I&#8217;m (we&#8217;re) doing. Trying to avoid garlic, onions, etc. is already hard; I&#8217;m also thinking that avoiding dairy will likely be more challenging than peanuts. And, if you eat with us, we especially appreciate that you take our dietary needs into consideration &#8211; understandably, it&#8217;s probably&nbsp;especially hard if you&nbsp;don&#8217;t need to conscientious of it in your everyday life; I&#8217;m sorry for the inconvenience. If you&#8217;re in a similar family situation, I&#8217;m open to hearing advice and your experiences too. Thank you!		</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				Wow. Having just returned&nbsp;from the Western Caribbean/Florida and trying to write a recap,&nbsp;I come across this post sitting in my draft. It looks like I wrote down some notes, but never finished it, and I&#8217;m not sure if I ever will, so let&#8217;s expand on some memories and post it now.</p>
<hr />
The decision to visit during the summer, during peak&nbsp;travel period wasn&#8217;t on the table but we did&nbsp;have vague plans to visit sometime to meet my sister&#8217;s baby&nbsp;and for the rest of my family to meet ours. As it turned out, my aunt was getting remarried and invited everyone to their banquet reception and the timing worked, so we redeemed aeroplan points for one way, and bought tickets back after school started so the prices were much better[ref]thankfully, we didn&#8217;t have to modify travel plans as&nbsp;some extended family members had[/ref]. &nbsp;At the wedding is where I get a 3-minute lesson from a cousin on whiskey-tasting 101: taking a sip straight up, then sucking in one breath of air after a sip, and finally with 1 drop of ice in the shot before taking a sip &#8211; each one delivering a different profile / depth.<br />
We all managed to get through the plane rides without too many tears. Bean sat in a car seat, which&nbsp;I much preferred her to be in than in a seat with just a lap belt; the height also allowed her to look out the window. She was happy to watch TV in silence (but no naps), and on the way back, we survived without having a seat back entertainment system &#8211; it also seems that the flight from YXX-Abbotsford is shorter by an hour! The baby was sure different from when Bean was his age &#8211; I couldn&#8217;t nurse him to sleep and keep him asleep; j.w&nbsp;had to help / intervene.<br />

Warm sunny weather welcomed us at the start of our vacation, which made the trip to the&nbsp;Sea to Sky Summit very worthwhile, as it was warm and skies were clear so you could see the views&nbsp;without having to hike up the Chief&nbsp;(photo: that&#8217;s neither me nor Bean). We then visited (enriched and encouraged by) our friends in Woodinville, as we traditionally do every time we&#8217;re out there, and every time, we&#8217;re reluctant to leave.<br />
Alas, the warm weather did not last, but held up enough so that when my dad&#8217;s car had a flat tire followed by a dead battery, I could take the baby out to the side of the road and wait &nbsp;&#8211; though we discovered that more people stopped because they saw me and the baby than when it was just j.w alone. And we all got sick, to the point where Bean developed hives and passed it to her cousin, and where I coughed so much coughed so much that the whole campsite heard me moan (dying cow?) in my sleep. We chickened out on the first day we were to set up camp (as it was damp and soggy and wouldn&#8217;t have helped my cold), and ended up joining our friends for 2 nights&nbsp;instead of 3. As it happens, we don&#8217;t generally hang out with too many families with young kids especially not all at once, so it took some time to get used to every child calling &#8220;mama, mama&#8221; and not wonder if it was Bean.<br />
<figure id="attachment_5393" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5393" style="width: 739px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class="wp-image-5393 size-large" src="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/IMG_20160903_193553_hdr-1024x768.jpg" width="739" height="554" srcset="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/IMG_20160903_193553_hdr-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/IMG_20160903_193553_hdr-300x225.jpg 300w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/IMG_20160903_193553_hdr-768x576.jpg 768w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/IMG_20160903_193553_hdr-1568x1175.jpg 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 739px) 100vw, 739px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-5393" class="wp-caption-text">Car camping in cold and damp weather is worth it when the warm sun finally comes out (or sets in this case).</figcaption></figure><br />
Bean and her cousin had a blast together, despite some tears throughout. We ended up staying at their place for the duration of our trip, so that the cousins could spend extended time together, and because my mom didn&#8217;t want our sickly germs prior to their cruise trip two weeks later [ref]to the point where I think I only saw her 3 times during our entire 3 weeks there &#8211; she probably figured she&#8217;d see us upon the end of their cruise anyway[/ref]. We visited the PNE &#8211; I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve been there since high school (the year I entered in some art contest, where my friend, Marie won!- and I took honourable mention). Since it poured, we stayed covered in the farm / agriculture area, where the kids get to go through stations and collect a treat at the end. I discovered that Bean was either afraid or didn&#8217;t like the (plastic) fish in her bucket as she would bury it at the bottom or not want to touch anything touching it.&nbsp;A momma pig looked happy nursing her many piglets, which made me think of the bond&nbsp;between breastfeeding mothers and babies and how it seemingly universal it is (though I wonder if they get latch problems too).<br />
Whether coincidentally or not, it seems that&nbsp;every time we visit my &#8220;home&#8221; church, major leadership changes happen: a pastor resigns or a new pastor comes on board; this time, they introduced a Chinese pastor &nbsp;and another&nbsp;English pastor announced his leave. In spite of the news, we both felt refreshed, as we were actually able to sit and listen to two sermons in a row, in its entirety without being interrupted by a baby (in the nursery) or a toddler (with her cousin and/or my sister in the toddler program). Furthermore, it was a series on marriage; a rare sermon topic at our church, likely because our demographics is mainly students. I don&#8217;t remember what it was about, except that we don&#8217;t pray as a married couple enough &#8211; but I&#8217;m guilty of not spending enough time with God one-on-one, so that would be a good place to start.&nbsp;<br />
During our visit, j.w started 3 months of parental leave; I was elated[ref]While it would have been incredible had he chosen to taken all 37 weeks &#8211; after all, it&#8217;s not often that one gets such an opportunity&nbsp;&#8211; he only wanted to take&nbsp;one month of absence from work for family bonding. I get it &#8211; I&#8217;ve seen the how (terribly) mothers are treated when they come back to work after a year of maternity leave &#8211; to a new team, new leadership, into a new assigned role and (worse) desk, and being away for less time should prevent that from happening; he also fears knowledge loss. &nbsp;However,&nbsp;we managed to negotiate it to three in exchange that I would watch&nbsp;Star Wars: the Force Awakens with him[/ref]. &nbsp;His parental leave began in the middle into&nbsp;our trip, and would end with another trip (sandwiching a road trip with friends midway).<br />
Bebe turned 9 months while we were visiting:</p>
<ul>
<li>this was the&nbsp;start of self-feeding / baby-led weaning; he pursed his lips and refused any pureed food; instead, he took to ribs and other chunky food</li>
<li>we found out that not all kiddie toilet seats are created equal, and had to order one from Amazon, where the curved seat prevented him from arching his back every time we put him on, which affected his bowel movements</li>
<li>bum shifting became a means for mobility</li>
</ul>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				My first experience seeing a Chinese (herbal) doctor didn&#8217;t fit my mental image of the &#8220;doctor&#8221; being an middle-aged or older Chinese man who wants your money, perhaps in a white wife-beater and/or a lab coat on top with black, round-rimmed, acetate glasses, who sells herbs at an herbal shop in a Chinese mall or Chinatown and does double duty by acting as a &#8220;doctor&#8221;, one who brings you to the back of the room, looks at your problem and weighs out some dried herbs for you to make and drink at home. I don&#8217;t even know where that image comes from, but this Chinese female doctor looked younger than expected, and she had an independent practice, specializing in acupuncture it seems, with consulting rooms and a receptionist inside (irony is that their were drapes that looked like shower curtains that covered the windows to convey a sense of privacy, but if you looked up, a surveillance camera points at you).<br />
The packets say Chinese Herbal Tea, but we were instructed to bathe the baby in it for 20 minutes every other day, one set a day. Let me tell you that bathing a baby for 20 minutes isn&#8217;t easy, especially if said baby can&#8217;t sit up on its own and you&#8217;re trying not to dilute the concentration by adding more warm water to keep the temperature. We were provided with that and a small container of non-identifiable, no label topical cream to be applied 2-3 times a day; this cream along with the expected herbal scent, has a pink tinge to it and it almost smells like roses (rosehip, rose water, rose geranium?)[ref]further Google research suggests that peony might be effective in the fight against eczema and it does have a light rose scent[/ref]. At least the container is a dark brown one, which means its meant to keep light out so the active ingredients don&#8217;t break down as quickly. I am skeptical of mystery &#8220;magical&#8221; products like these and especially since they&#8217;re from China (who knows what it could be tainted with &#8211; lead? mercury?), but I appreciated that each packet of &#8220;spice&#8221; contained the name and amount, most foreign to me except one or two I recognized:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.americandragon.com/Individualherbsupdate/DiYu.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Radix Sanguisorbae</a> (1.2g extracted from 10g): targets liver, large intestine; cooling properties (I&#8217;m guessing that may also extend to anti-itch and reducing inflamed areas)</li>
<li>Herba Portulacae (1.8g extracted from 15g): targets liver, large intestine</li>
<li>Fructus Kochiae (0.9g extracted from 10g): targets kidney, bladder; alleviates itching</li>
<li>Radix Sophorae Flavescentis (0.6g extracted from 6g): targets liver, intestine; alleviates itching</li>
<li><a href="https://tcmwiki.com/wiki/radix-et-rhizoma-rhei" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Radix Et Rhizoma Rhei</a> (0.6g extracted from 3g): targets large intestine; also known as rhubarb!</li>
<li><a href="http://tcmwiki.com/wiki/pericarpium-zanthoxyli" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pericarpium Zanthoxyli</a> (0.6g extracted from 6g): targets stomach; relieves itching (perhaps because of the numbing properties? the Chinese name &#8220;hua jiao&#8221; reminded me of this tongue numbing prickly heat sauce that my parents have in their cupboards, which I often associate with sichuan peppers)</li>
<li><a href="http://tcmwiki.com/wiki/folium-isatidis" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Folium Isatidis</a> (0.9g of 10g): targets liver and stomach</li>
</ul>
<p>So the common theme seems to be a heat-expelling formula that targets the digestive system, which seems to be in-line with western natural wellness thinking &#8211; that eczema is a symptom of what&#8217;s going on in your gut / digestive system / with your digestion, often a sign of food sensitivities or allergies. This also seems to match what another Chinese herbal remedies site suggests about common formulas[ref]. Wonder if this kind of &#8220;heat&#8221; is the same as &#8220;hot air&#8221;-associated foods like chocolate (she did say not to have any), chips, crustaceans, deep-fried oily food. And would eating &#8220;cooling&#8221; foods like watermelon, cucumber, bittermelon help with baby&#8217;s skin then?<br />
<strong>&#8220;Formulas that clear heat</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Clear heat and reduce fire</li>
<li>Clear heat and eliminate toxins</li>
<li>Clear heat and purge lung fire</li>
<li>Cleanse liver and resolves toxicity</li>
<li>Clear dampness-heat in liver and bladder</li>
<li>Clear dampness-heat in intestines and stomach&#8221;</li>
</ul>
<p>Source: <a href="http://www.chineseherbshealing.com/chinese-herbal-formulas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://www.chineseherbshealing.com/chinese-herbal-formulas</a>[/ref]<br />
I think I would still prefer naturopathic doctors (ND) over Chinese doctors (CMD) because it seems NDs take more time to explain (treatment, etc.) and look at the lifestyle as a whole, even though I know that Chinese medicine is probably even more holistic (and mystical to me) if you look at the body&#8217;s qi, etc.; it is also nice that extended health insurance covers the services of a ND (probably because they are registered and governed by a body), but not of a CMD. Would I have seen a Chinese doctor for my baby&#8217;s eczema without nudging from my mother-in-law? Probably not. Especially not because of the cost and because we are already seeing a dermatologist (and thus East meets or conflicts with West?) and because our first outgrew most of hers. Admittedly, with only one treatment so far, it seems to be more effective in speedy results compared with the continued steroid / cortisone use (which I don&#8217;t want to rely on anyway); I just don&#8217;t know if there are going to be side effects or if the problem will come back and I wasn&#8217;t told what the products would do so it feels like she expects me to trust her in blind faith. I know baby skin and bodies are just so much more sensitive than our adult ones, and because it absorbs everything like a sponge and their little systems are still growing, I still have reservations on whether we made the right choice &#8211; maybe it&#8217;s an answered prayer since it coincided around the same time. So maybe the $220+ will be worthwhile ($100 for consultation fee, $50 for the packets and $70 cream&#8230;<em>yipes</em>), but maybe not. I guess like all areas where I have little knowledge in, this is where some faith comes into play; I may have faith in God, but I trust him so it comes easier than faith in mankind.		</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				In the days leading up to Easter, I came across another perspective around the story where Jesus&#8217; disciples goes fishing after His death. You see, all along I had just assumed that these men were <del>mourning over the death of their friend</del> hanging out, and instead of <del>working out their grief</del> over some beer at some local bar, they exchanged memories and stories of Jesus while they fished, which was something to do to pass the time and which they had often done together before.</p>
<blockquote><p><span id="en-ESV-26889" class="text John-21-2"><sup class="versenum">2&nbsp;</sup>Simon Peter, Thomas (called the Twin), Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, the sons of Zebedee, and two others of his disciples were together.</span> <span id="en-ESV-26890" class="text John-21-3"><sup class="versenum">3&nbsp;</sup>Simon Peter said to them, “I am going fishing.” They said to him, “We will go with you.” They went out and got into the boat, but that night they caught nothing. &#8211; <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John.21.2-John.21.3&amp;version=ESV" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">John 21: 2-3 (ESV)</a><br />
</span></p></blockquote>
<p>However, it hadn&#8217;t occurred to me that maybe they were going back to their old ways: instead of continuing to be <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+4:19&amp;version=ESV" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fishers of men</a>, they were once again fishers of fish. Did they go back to fishing fish because Jesus was gone so there wasn&#8217;t a point to continue being fishers of men so they were going back to their lives pre-Jesus? That was a sobering revelation to me, as I know I&#8217;m oft guilty of reliving the past or going back to old habits that are poor marks of a Christian &#8211; that do not reflect that I know Christ, something Paul kept reminding the people of the new churches about countless of times in the New Testament.</p>
<blockquote><p><span id="en-ESV-29276" class="text Eph-4-20"><sup class="versenum">20&nbsp;</sup>But that is not the way you learned Christ!—</span> <span id="en-ESV-29277" class="text Eph-4-21"><sup class="versenum">21&nbsp;</sup>assuming that you have heard about him and were taught in him, as the truth is in Jesus,</span> <span id="en-ESV-29278" class="text Eph-4-22"><sup class="versenum">22&nbsp;</sup>to put off your old self, which belongs to your former manner of life and is corrupt through deceitful desires,</span> <span id="en-ESV-29279" class="text Eph-4-23"><sup class="versenum">23&nbsp;</sup>and to be renewed in the spirit of your minds,</span> <span id="en-ESV-29280" class="text Eph-4-24"><sup class="versenum">24&nbsp;</sup>and to put on the new self, created after the likeness of God in true righteousness and holiness. [&#8230;] <span id="en-ESV-29288" class="text Eph-4-32"><sup class="versenum">32&nbsp;</sup>Be kind to one another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, as God in Christ forgave you.</span> &#8211; Ephesians 4:20-24, 32 (ESV)<br />
</span></p></blockquote>
<p>I was surprised that I had never thought to see the story from this light, but because <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews+4:12&amp;version=ESV" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the word of God <em>is</em> living and active</a> after all, I shouldn&#8217;t be surprised to learn new things from and about it.&nbsp;<br />
EDIT: A friend pointed out to me that this wasn&#8217;t the first time he&#8217;s appeared to the disciples, so maybe we&#8217;re just looking into this too much. Regardless, the latter point about not being Christ-like still holds true for me.		</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				We&#8217;ve been back for about an equal amount of time that we&#8217;ve been away so this post is overdue!</p>
<h3>Returning (to my childhood) home</h3>
<p>I hadn&#8217;t been back for an extended period for a decade so I was looking forward to spending time with friends we don&#8217;t see when we go back and seeing family more often than when we usually do when we go back (which is significant when you realize people, like your parents especially, are a decade older!). Yet, it wasn&#8217;t long before we got into a regular routine (including baby getting sick every 2 weeks and her sleeping-in) and my ambitions to bring babe to more activities resulted in only one visit to the library story time and song program, two visits to <a href="http://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/topic.page?id=F652EE0BCB224DC4A51BE9765B50817D&amp;title=StrongStart%20BC" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">StrongStart</a>, a visit or two to each indoor play space (Guildford Recreation Centre (1), Brentwood (1), Coquitlam Centre (2), and Lougheed Mall (1)), and one-time visits with friends and extended family we don&#8217;t normally see on our short visits. Towards the end of the trip, I realized that in my procrastination (laziness or perception that everything is so far), I didn&#8217;t end up seeing everyone we wanted &#8211; at first, the thinking was, &#8220;Oh, we have all this time&#8230;&#8221; but then by the last week or so, it became a scramble to fit everyone we wanted to see into our schedule and we had to miss some people.&nbsp; But, this real-life lesson hit home for me when it comes to our spiritual state: we often tend to put God off in our lives, thinking that there&#8217;s so much time in our lives to think about that until it&#8217;s too late.<br />
What really struck me as being strange, is that I didn&#8217;t have a strong desire to go snowshoeing this time &#8211; which seems to reflect how I felt about snow activities growing up; it was not until I moved away and returned home that I wanted to snowboard and snowshoe (and ice skate). I&#8217;m not sure if it was because we acclimatized to the warmer weather that I didn&#8217;t really want to venture into the cold, whereas coming from cold makes the mountain weather more tolerable.<br />
Little Bean hit many milestones while there including walking and saying &#8220;Daddy!&#8221; for the first time, and while it took some time for her to be herself again (after being intimidated by new faces and places), I was happy to see that she found friends more her age to play with, especially at church, and that her separation anxiety seemed to taper off, which meant she was okay in the church nursery &#8211; even to the point where mommy and her friend was able to get a smoothie sans toddler in tow!</p>
<h3>Returning (to this family&#8217;s) home</h3>
<p>Just as it took her almost a month to adapt to her surroundings while she was away, she also seemed to feel less at ease to freely roam and explore back at home when we returned, and although the first few times back at church meant she was more clingy, she&#8217;s now back to herself and seems more open to meeting new faces and spending time with people without her parents always by her side. While I do miss the daily option to go to a free program at a local school for her, a childcare program at church, the number of free indoor play spaces, and her same-age friend and her cousin, it&#8217;s good to be back&nbsp; &#8211; and we can work on finding things to do here and getting to know other children here.<br />
Upon our return, I learned a few things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Buzz Lightyear somehow managed to get two hours ahead! (my side table alarm clock which seems to never be on time so I stopped resetting it every so often)</li>
<li>If you don&#8217;t want your toys and other things to be covered in dust, especially when you&#8217;re renovating, put them away or make sure they&#8217;re covered</li>
<li>And in terms of milestones, I stopped counting. Except that at 17 months, she willfully disobeyed, which when it happened, I thought hashtag <em>#originalsin</em> and it became another spiritual lesson: we teach our children to do many things, but we don&#8217;t need to teach them to give you a look that says they&#8217;re going to test the boundaries and then go about doing what you instructed them not to do, just as God often tells us things for our own good but we don&#8217;t listen and do the complete opposite.</li>
</ul>
