<h3>Gen Con: Thursday through Sunday</h3>


I started off my first day of Gen Con with two non-gaming mini workshops on the art and method of zentangle; everyone else stormed the exhibit hall when it opened. I had a great time doodling with a purpose! The rest of the day, I strolled through the exhibit hall collecting freebies, browsing the booths, and demoing a couple of short games.
Other than me joining the audience to watch an interview with the puppeteer and voice of Big Bird and Oscar the Grouch (who knew that they were played by the same person!) and his wife [ref] &#8211; there was an entire puppet stream / track at this convention, and the puppeteer and voice for Kermit the frog and Ernie (both played by the same person) was also there which I missed! [/ref], for the next couple of days, j.w and I spent most of our time together to look around the hall and demo games (at the hall and CGE/Rio Grande rooms); I found myself playing more games when with another person around than on my own.

We stopped for a bit to see the cosplay contest for the first time as we missed out on the parade as our True Dungeon game took longer than expected &#8211; wow, some people are truly dedicated at hand making their costume!


<h3>Games</h3>




<h4>Notes for next time</h4>




<ul>
    

<li>the C n C booth resells Rio Grande games; you can bargain with them.</li>


    

<li>Cool stuff inc has a dings and dents (or last stock) shelf that they restock throughout the convention. You can also use the $2 off coupon in the coupon book with these games.</li>


</ul>




<h4>I would consider buying or playing again</h4>

<ul>
    

<li><a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/257527/trapwords" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Trapwords</strong></a> (coming out in the Fall sometime) &#8211; advanced taboo, best played with people you know</li>


    

<li><strong><a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgameexpansion/233891/ticket-ride-map-collection-volume-6-france-old-wes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ticket to Ride: France</a></strong>: the tracks aren&#8217;t colored ahead of time, so you use one action to assign a color <i>but</i> your opponents could claim it before you do!</li>


    

<li><strong>Roll for the Galaxy: Ambition</strong>: extra cards and goals to complete. I regret not picking this one up at $23 &#8211; $2 at the dents and dings shelf at Cool Stuff Inc. because I wasn&#8217;t sure how it would play and didn&#8217;t know its retail price (later found out it sold elsewhere at the convention for $40). If they reminded me of the $2 off coupon, I would&#8217;ve picked it up. Though, pro-tip, don&#8217;t do as I did: don&#8217;t play and drink for you might roll your drink cup (filled with coffee in my case) instead of your dice cup. Though now that I know Amazon.com has it for $24, thanks to someone telling me about <a href="http://boardgameprices.com">boardgameprices.com</a> at the consignment store, I don&#8217;t feel as regretful.</li>


    

<li><strong>King Domino: Age of Giants</strong> (expansion)</li>


    

<li><strong>drop it</strong>: quick game to play, can play with kids, but hard to master, but would only get it if it was on sale, as the sticker price was $30 USD</li>


    

<li><strong>Cities of Splendor</strong>: adds a bunch of expansion games to Splendor, but would only buy this if we get a copy of Splendor. We&#8217;ve been playing Splendor on our phones / tablet after a friend taught us how to play, but the feel of the game is nice</li>


    

<li><strong>Word slam</strong>: A team vs. team game where you use existing word cards to try to and get your teammates to guess the correct word without using any gestures or your voice. It seemed to get a bit repetitive after a few rounds, but I like word games, so I&#8217;d be willing to give this one another try.</li>


</ul>




<h4>Did not get a chance to try</h4>




<ul>
    

<li><strong>Queen Domino</strong></li>


    

<li><strong>King Domino: Age of Giants</strong> (expansion)</li>


    

<li><strong>Terraforming Mars</strong>: I heard it has a Race for the Galaxy feel to it!</li>


    

<li><strong><a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/244330/scarabya" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Scarabya</a></strong><a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/244330/scarabya" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> &#8211; by Blue Orange, the same publisher and designer of King Domino.</a> I did meet the game designer in person, and it was sort of interesting to see that everyone at the booth was from France except for one American, even though they have an office in Silicon Valley.</li>


    

<li><strong>trash pandas</strong>: I only found this intriguing because I like the art of Sushi Go and the others at the Gamewright booth like this one looked cute, and was sold out on the first day.</li>


</ul>




<h4>Games I tried that I probably wouldn&#8217;t pay money for</h4>




<ul>
    

<li><strong>Catan VR</strong> (needs an Oculus set first)</li>


    

<li><strong>Small World: Sky Island</strong> (too many pieces! would be more fun to play on a tablet or smartphone)</li>


    

<li>Other expansions of Dominion (too many cards! but fun to play anyway)</li>


    

<li>Escape-room type card games. I feel like these are one-time plays and thus a waste of resources</li>


    

<li><a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/141791/pinata" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Pinata</strong></a>: a two-player game that seems kid-friendly but gets really repetitive quickly (maybe that&#8217;s why it&#8217;s perfect for a mother-daughter game); the consignment store had it for $12</li>


    

<li><strong>Chicken Cha Cha Cha</strong>: relies on a lot of memory &#8211; great for a younger audience</li>


    

<li><strong>Codenames: Duet</strong> &#8211; is a fun game but the group game seems more fun</li>


    

<li><strong>True Dungeon</strong> (TD): when j.w played it the first time, he came home raving about it. I think with the rise of escape rooms, I&#8217;d rather spend my money there (works out to be around the same price per hour). TD was a RPG/D&amp;D+Escape room hybrid: you&#8217;re in the dark going from space to space with divider walls draped with fabric to match the theme to separate the rooms; there&#8217;s a dungeon/game master in each room that yells out scenarios and penalties and then some random actors dressed up in themed costumes. I randomly died in the middle of the game (turned into stone after a low die roll), which mean I couldn&#8217;t participate in 3 out of 6 or 7 rooms, so I feel like I got ripped off somewhat.I felt like there was little to no onboarding for new players (had no idea what happened, and when to dock myself life). At the beginning, we spent a considerable time trying to figure out what our given random tokens meant and how to suit up our character by trading our tokens with others as each one had a special ability or armour/weapon. I wish they explained it better that certain tokens are more valuable than others, such as the purple ones, which are ultra rare (1 in every 100 packs), so you don&#8217;t trade them away. Thankfully, j.w had played before so he pocketed the purple one that I had opened (instead of giving or trading it away) and later found out that it sold for $75, but the buy price was $35, so I guess we got back most of my game. At least I contributed to solving a puzzle fairly quickly before our time was up.</li>


</ul>

<ol>
    

<li><strong><a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/98229/pictomania" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pictomania</a></strong>, newest edition (surprised that it was j.w who wanted a copy because it&#8217;s a group game and you have to draw!) &#8211; a hybrid of pictionary and speed where everyone in the game participates at the same time.</li>


    

<li><strong><a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/28620/phoenicia" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Phoenicia</a></strong> &#8211; by the same designer as Race for the Galaxy. Hadn&#8217;t heard of it &#8211; only picked up because it was $10 at the consignment store [ref] future note to self: every day a board game stays at the consignment store, it drops in price[/ref]</li>


    

<li><strong>Pressure Cooker</strong> &#8211; from Rio Grande, looks like Overcooked and for $10, it&#8217;s worth the try
[caption id="" align="alignright" width="680"]<img class="size-medium" src="https://geekandsundry.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/everdell.png" width="680" height="582" /> Image from <a href="https://geekandsundry.com/build-your-new-home-with-critters-and-cards-in-everdell/">https://geekandsundry.com/build-your-new-home-with-critters-and-cards-in-everdell/</a>[/caption]</li>


    

<li><a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/199792/everdell" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Everdell</strong></a> &#8211; definitely my favourite game from our purchases. I hadn&#8217;t heard of this kickstarter game until we passed by the booth on the last day. The artwork was what drew me in first as it reminded me of why I read some graphic novels, then phrases like tableau building, worker resource placement, Race for the Galaxy meets 7 Wonders / Agricola were the right words to hear. This was a game I was willing to pay a lot of money for! The designer, James Wilson, and his wife was there explaining the game and signing the collector&#8217;s edition. I learned that they&#8217;re from Idaho and Gen Con was their first big-city experience. He does embroidery printing as his day job, and that he&#8217;s worked on this game for over 5 years now. They had hoped to sell 100 copies at this convention, but they had sold over 1000 copies by Sunday morning! (so far, I have yet to win a game though <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f641.png" alt="🙁" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> )</li>


    

<li><strong>Race for the Galaxy: Xeno Wars</strong> &#8211; turns out we already have this expansion, but we hadn&#8217;t gotten around to playing with the extra pieces yet, so I didn&#8217;t recognize the cards (but found the box to be very familiar &#8211; and that was why)</li>


    

<li><strong>Robits</strong> &#8211; a kid-friendly $3 game for $1 because we had a $2 off coupon</li>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				<![CDATA[I'm at the age where I'm comfortable with shopping and ordering online. And while I prefer to text and instant message people over chatting on the phone, I felt uneasy texting an unknown Toronto number to order a box of brownies for local delivery; so, my age is beginning to show, perhaps?
The other day, I came across an ad on Facebook: the premise is that you text a number to order some treats (brownies in this case), and they deliver to your door. The conversation started on Facebook Messenger and then transitioned over to SMS, where I was able to order a box of dairy-and-nut-free, reduced-sugar brownies. Sure enough, that evening, a box of brownies showed up at the door, with a real person - the baker - behind it.
My first SMS order was a success! And while I feel like this way might be more personal and a cheaper than ordering through an e-commerce site, traditional credibility (ethos) goes out the window, which impacts the professional image. It didn't help that they wanted me to give an online review on a Facebook group in exchange for free delivery, and when they told me they took square (for credit card payments), I expected to pay with a credit card, but on delivery, he told me he didn't bring it because everyone paid with cash (square charges a fee). I also took measures to use a throwaway SMS number as I didn't want a business to have my personal mobile number for other marketing purposes.

But I probably would order from <a href="https://www.facebook.com/bakehurry/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bake-Hurry</a> again &#8211; especially if they had a promo since dairy-free and nut-free baked treats are hard to come by! When local hipster cafes and bakeries start charging an upwards of $4 for a square brownie, a box of 24 decently sized pieces of freshly baked custom brownies for $30 (or $20 for first time customers) becomes a great price and I like being able to support our local small businesses. The way they are boxed makes them look homemade, but they do come from a rented commercial kitchen (Courtyard Kitchens), in the same building as <a href="https://www.fourall.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Four All Ice Cream</a> in Kitchener. I should have frozen some had I done some pricing research since they should last up to a month in the freezer or a week in the fridge. They do have a nice chocolately crunch on the outside with a soft chew on the inside, just as advertised, and just the way I like my freshly baked cookies. I&#8217;m glad I asked for reduced sugar because I found it sufficiently sweet &#8211; the regular version would probably have been too sweet for me. A friend commented on the texture, that it reminded her of mooncake, but perhaps that is because it is the dairy-free version?
Same day (from order to) delivery is another win in my books, as it&#8217;s perfect for those cravings (for dessert, a sweet bite, or those midnight munchies &#8211; like right now) and last minute meal prep and I don&#8217;t have to go out to get them, especially if I don&#8217;t want to lug my kids around with me.]]&gt;		</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				<![CDATA[Think daiso, dollar store, aliexpress, plus any facebook mama co-ops, all mixed into one site; one that actually has a better mobile experience than a desktop one - that's <a href="http://wish.com">Wish</a> for you.
I came across the Wish site and app through a Facebook advertisement, and was intrigued because the products were similar to what the co-op groups were selling (often from China) and at much lower prices.  So, I googled. Reviews were mixed, with many poor ratings from consumers, but <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/ryanmac/2016/12/07/wish-ceo-compares-shopping-apps-success-to-donald-trumps-victory-confirms-500-million-investment/#4546098793b3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">write-ups on tech</a> and <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/ryanmac/2016/12/07/wish-ceo-compares-shopping-apps-success-to-donald-trumps-victory-confirms-500-million-investment/#4546098793b3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">business sites</a> and <a href="https://www.therecord.com/news-story/7108343-six-uw-grads-have-founded-firms-worth-more-than-1-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mentions in local sites</a> / <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/stories/waterloo-math-alumnus-named-forbes-top-40-under-40" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">UW</a> seemed to be positive in terms of its success and business model. I gave it a chance though because I ended up finding out that the cofounder and co-CEO was a former colleague/MSN Messenger friend from my UW language lab days, with whom I eventually lost touch with after he moved to Toronto[ref]&#8230;because how many &#8220;Danny Zhang&#8221;s are there in the world, and what are the chances? turns out it was the one I knew[/ref] &#8211; I attribute my impulse buy of Yahoo! stocks to his indirect influence (which ended up tanking and then only finally evened out a couple years ago, at which point we promptly sold it) ← this is to say that I trust-ed him. He&#8217;s a super smart/hardworking guy, so I was super excited to learn about this (ad)venture!

<ol>
    

<li>Refund policy on goods that do not arrive by the promised date. I just learned that <a href="http://bc.ctvnews.ca/delivery-delays-online-customers-waiting-months-for-orders-from-china-1.3441778" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">packages tend to take forever to clear customs in Canada</a> in general and not necessarily because of Wish itself, so it often doesn&#8217;t get delivered until past the expected date &#8211; one of my first packages was delivered within a month to Kitchener, but it stayed in some facility for two months, and then only came after I got my refund. You do need to stay on top of it and open a support ticket to request a refund though. I have received 6 out of 18 items so far before the expected arrival date; the rest have been refunded &#8211; some of which have since arrived while the rest are still missing or in limbo / la-la-land somewhere. My theory is that their algorithm will self-adjust based on when you tell them that you&#8217;ve received an item (after the expected arrival time has passed, it will ask you if you have received it and if so, when), so that eventually, they will estimate a more accurate (and likely more lengthy) shipping time so you don&#8217;t keep getting free goods.</li>


    

<li>Additional discounts  &#8211; it uses the psychology of limited time offers (and limited quantity offers) to persuade you to buy something. For example:


<ul>
    

<li>Group buy pricing &#8211; cheaper if you buy with someone, or if someone buys with you, you get a rebate to be used on your next purchase (by a certain time)</li>


    

<li>Instant offers &#8211; cheaper by a very small amount if you buy it within a set time</li>


    

<li>Promotional pricing &#8211; the more you buy and the more you review, the more points you get towards leveling up. Every time you level up, you get a discount &#8211; which expires after a certain time</li>


    

<li>Cart savings. <strong>Pro-tip:</strong> if you do not need to buy something right away and there is no timed discount offered, leave it in your cart and keep going to your cart and leaving your cart. Some time later, you will be offered an extra 5% off if you buy it right away</li>


    

<li>Spinning the daily discount wheel &#8211; it seems to be based on items you have viewed or have in your cart, discounted for 10 minutes</li>


</ul>


</li>


</ol>


What do you need to watch for?


<ol>
    

<li>Don&#8217;t buy anything you need if you need it by a certain time; if history is a good predictor, it can and will take months &#8211; see first point in the section above.</li>


    

<li>Look at the price &#8211; many times, it advertises &#8220;up to&#8221; a certain % off (either 50% if a referral, or 20%), but I haven&#8217;t actually gotten anything more than 5% off, and I&#8217;m not even sure how to get it up to the advertised discount. Don&#8217;t trust the regular prices &#8211; they&#8217;re over-inflated, and research your prices before buying even with the discounts; sometimes, you can get it locally or elsewhere for about the same price or even lower. And click on the Related section/tab to see if other stores with similar ratings sell it for a lower price. Remember, Wish is not a single store, so if you&#8217;re reading negative comments about products from the Wish site, you need to remember that it&#8217;s likely dependent on the reseller / shop and not Wish itself (similar to Aliexpress, eBay, Amazon).</li>


    

<li>Reviews. My own rule is to read each product&#8217;s reviews and only buy something that is 4 stars or more with the more ratings the better (ie. 100+), unless you are willing to take the risk and throw that money away should it not meet your expectations. You need to pay for shipping if you send back an item, so most often than not, it&#8217;s not worth it, so I don&#8217;t buy big-ticket items.</li>


    

<li>It&#8217;s hard to track down a specific item, unless you know how to search for it; if you are just browsing, it&#8217;s a better shopping experience</li>


    

<li>Clothing sizing is often in Asian sizing. I&#8217;m Asian, so next time I might just go with that because <a href="https://www.wish.com/c/557a85dc8b8cb34ac6ebd5c0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a L dress ended up too big</a> in the bust area despite reviews saying it&#8217;s really small (I&#8217;m a US XS, so I&#8217;m probably 2 sizes up as opposed to 3). I&#8217;ve been trying to avoid buying adult clothing just because you can&#8217;t try it on first, but I find children&#8217;s clothing to be easier to buy as I can always buy larger and hope they will grow into &#8211; that and the price point for children&#8217;s clothing is generally lower.</li>


    

<li>Know that most products are made in China; they may not be the best quality, and you may be getting a product that is like its brand-name counterpart (or counterfeit &#8211; some product rating comments will say that despite the advertised brand, it&#8217;s not the quality they expect from that brand).</li>


    

<li>Support, other than on shipping, seems to be miserable &#8211; you get a different rep at each interaction and the reps sound like they follow a script so response is slow and frustrating. Case in point: I tried to get technical support because the app said I had a discount that would be automatically applied before a certain date, but I tried adding items to my cart and the discount wasn&#8217;t being applied. I did get an email reminder saying that the promo would expire in a few days (before the posted date) so I asked them to send my feedback to the technical team; the Zendesk Help thread is still ongoing.</li>


    

<li>Wish is not just one app / site &#8211; they have a few others focusing on different offerings: geek, home, mama are a few of the segmented branches. However, the user experience is a very disconnected, lacking SSO (single sign on) which means you need to create a separate account for each one and your point and level history starts at 0, despite it selling the same items at the same prices &#8211; for the most part. I have noticed that the separate apps tend to be more experimental first (A/B testing?) &#8211; for example, all items used to have a base cost, with shipping to Canada about $2-$3 for a small package. However, in the separate apps one day, I noticed the same item had $0 cost but the shipping went up by $1-$2; the final total was either the same, or cheaper by $1, so I ordered through the separate app. A few days later, this model was applied on the main site / app (for marketing effectiveness, it does seem that the &#8220;you just need to pay shipping&#8221; model is more enticing than a product that costs money with a lower shipping cost). So my<strong> pro-tip</strong> advice, is that you can look on the other more focused apps / sites if you&#8217;d like, but use the main Wish app / site to buy so you can keep your points in one place (for faster discounts), and you can keep a track of your purchases all in one place.</li>


</ol>


If by now you are as curious as I was about this Wish site, and you haven&#8217;t signed up, download the Wish app (on phone, don&#8217;t sign up via desktop browser), use promo code <em>dpvwsfd</em> to save <em>up to </em>50% off your first purchase &#8211; do let me know if you actually save 50% , because I&#8217;m thinking you&#8217;ll save at most 5%.]]&gt;		</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				<![CDATA[When we go on family vacations, I often end up finding myself being our family's "travel agent", so here's a handy list of what I consult when doing travel research or trying to get the best travel deal for my future reference, and for yours, if you end up being your family's travel guy/guide:


<h2>In general</h2>


These are two places I check first for flights and accommodations:


<ul>
    

<li>Google Flights &#8211; use them to get a sense of what the prices are, and where you might be able to find the lowest price if you&#8217;re more flexible with dates
[caption id="attachment_5515" align="alignnone" width="294"]<a href="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/flights.png"><img class="wp-image-5515 size-medium" src="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/flights-294x300.png" alt="Google Flights Flexible Date Chart to find the best price" width="294" height="300" srcset="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/flights-294x300.png 294w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/flights.png 699w" sizes="(max-width: 294px) 100vw, 294px" /></a> To find the price graph or chart, you need to click on the calendar icon in either date field.[/caption]</li>


    

<li>AirBnb</li>


</ul>


If you&#8217;re flexible on time and destination, you can find some pretty great flight deals on <a href="http://forums.redflagdeals.com/hot-deals-f9/?c=5159" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RedFlagDeals</a> or&nbsp;<a href="http://www.yyzdeals.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YYZ Deals</a>&nbsp;/ <a href="http://www.yvrdeals.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YVR Deals</a> (or other Canadian destinations via the parent company,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ydeals.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YDeals</a>)
For ideas of what to do or eat, I like to sign out books from the library or borrow e-books from the library and jot down common suggestions or interesting ideas and go from there.


<h2>Within Canada</h2>




<h3>Flights</h3>




<ul>
    

<li>Pick smaller airports if they&#8217;re similar in distance to your destination and price (e.g. Abbotsford over Vancouver, Kitchener-Waterloo vs. Toronto) as you&#8217;ll likely find cheaper parking, shorter check-in and security lines, and friendlier people</li>


    

<li>Cheaper seats tend to occur between Tuesday and Thursday</li>


    

<li>Check for the prices of flights&nbsp;operated by smaller brands like <a href="http://gonewleaf.ca" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NewLeaf </a>or <a href="http://flyporter.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Porter</a>, and even the sub-brands of major carriers like&nbsp;Air Canada Rouge or Air Canada Jazz. There are charters too like Air Transat or Sunwing, but I generally avoid them due to size and luggage restrictions.</li>


</ul>




<h3>Car Rentals</h3>




<ul>
    

<li>Costco Travel Canada, for Costco members; free second driver if spouse is also a Costco member</li>


    

<li>Priceline &#8211; I haven&#8217;t used them, but my parents have been able to rent a car near the Toronto airport for $10 a day by bidding on a car rental once upon a time.</li>


</ul>




<h3>Accommodations</h3>




<ul>
    

<li>I find there are less listings in Canada on Airbnb.com (likely because it started in SF, CA, so you might find more choices out West vs East), but one good alternative are bed &amp; breakfasts on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bbcanada.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bbcanada.com</a></li>


    

<li>If you&#8217;re travelling to a university town, you can always check their conference center or student residences if it&#8217;s during a quiet time of the year (e.g. summer) for private suites, student apartments, etc.</li>


</ul>




<h2>Canada to/from US</h2>




<h3>Flights</h3>




<ul>
    

<li>Fly from a US city instead of Canada, if it&#8217;s within driving distance; one night&#8217;s sleep and fly package at a hotel (where parking is included when you&#8217;re away) is cheaper than cost of difference in flight</li>


    

<li>Compared to Canada, there seems to be more&nbsp;competition and options in the US:&nbsp;while there are major US-international airlines&nbsp;(United, American Airlines, Delta), we actually prefer the service and price of domestic-only&nbsp;carriers like JetBlue or Southwest; we have not flown ultra-budget airline, Spirit yet, but seat-sale prices are good, even with the price of one checked baggage ($21 per person).</li>


    

<li>Honorable/historic mention: Hipmunk.com, once a SF startup, which provides a more comprehensive view of travel duration, prices on&nbsp;discount sites like Expedia, Travelocity, etc., but to be honest,&nbsp;I don&#8217;t consult it as much&nbsp;anymore now that Google Flight is an option.</li>


</ul>




<h3>Accommodations</h3>




<ul>
    

<li><a href="http://www.airbnb.ca/c/ewong61" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Airbnb</a>&nbsp;(referral link &#8211; $40CAD for first booking)</li>


    

<li>Priceline &#8211; many people have booked via priceline, but if you&#8217;re travelling with more than 2, please note that the fine print says that the price is for two, so I&#8217;m not sure how it works if you plan to travel with more (do you pay the difference? I haven&#8217;t ever tried)</li>


    

<li><a href="https://www.vrbo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VRBO</a> and <a href="https://www.homeaway.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HomeAway</a>&nbsp;&#8211; so I&#8217;m still not clear about&nbsp;the difference between these two sites as they belong to the same company,&nbsp;and they seem to operate similarly to AirBnB but it seems less organized. My sister has booked with them before, for our places in Hawaii.</li>


</ul>




<h3>Car rental</h3>


<a href="https://www.autoslash.com/blog-and-tips/posts/all-about-additional-driver-fees" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Note that certain states cover a second driver for free</a>, and some car rental companies will have free second drivers if they&#8217;re your spouse or if you are a member, for example.


<ul>
    

<li>Costco Travel may have different prices on the US site vs. the Canadian site &#8211; and you need to have separate logins as well; free second driver if spouse is also a Costco member</li>


    

<li><a href="http://autoslash.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Autoslash</a>: we came across this site from Parents magazine &#8211; if you can&#8217;t find a good deal on their site, if you book via another site (like Costco) and send them the confirmation number, it will look for cheaper options until your trip starts. If you end up booking through them, they will automatically cancel and book the same reservation for you if the price drops before your rental starts! I couldn&#8217;t figure out&nbsp;their revenue model so it seemed too good to be true at first, but it worked out great. We found out the hard way that some companies don&#8217;t include fees in the car rental quotes, but this site breaks everything down for you so it&#8217;s WYSIWYG (or pay in this case). You don&#8217;t actually pay until you get to the car rental counter! If you are looking for a specific service, eg. a shuttle to/from the cruise port, you might need to enter a specific location code, which can be found in the car rental fine print when you search for an itinerary OR you can email them to ask which location offers it (they do seem to know!)</li>


</ul>


So, that&#8217;s what we have used in the past&nbsp;&#8211; if you have any links to add to the list / share, please leave a comment!]]&gt;		</p>

				<description><![CDATA[
				<![CDATA[]]>		]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				<![CDATA[This is the last entry in this series. The first two covered the highlights <a href="http://her.happyhippos.ca/2016/12/western-caribbean-before-and-after-the-cruise/">before and after the cruise</a> and <a href="http://her.happyhippos.ca/2016/12/western-caribbean-norwegian-getaway/">the cruise ship experience itself</a>. Finally, this &nbsp;one covers what we did on port days at Roatan, Harvest Caye, Costa Maya, and Cozumel.
The itinerary and cost are usually the two most important factors when we&nbsp;select a ship to sail on, specifically the days at sea to port days ratio, and the destinations.&nbsp;We had originally selected a sailing that included a stop in Belize (City), but when I found out NCL&#8217;s brand new private island was opening a couple weeks&#8217; later,&nbsp;it seemed worthwhile to pay a little more to check it out. In the end, we still paid less because our cruise agent checked before our final&nbsp;payment, and the prices had gone down so she relayed the savings to us![ref]My mom recalls this happening before and since we were very happy with our previous cruise agent, who&nbsp;she&nbsp;has since retired, we just continued using someone from Expedia CruiseShip Centers&nbsp;anyway[/ref]. &nbsp;Ironically enough, after reading post after post that warned visitors about going beyond the port gates at Belize City and thinking Harvest Caye was definitely a safer and more developed alternative, we actually enjoyed Harvest Caye the least. We probably would have enjoyed the adventure in Belize City, as&nbsp;authenticity and culture was lacking at Harvest Caye.


<h2>Roatan, Honduras</h2>


This was our second-favourite stop.
In Roatan, we booked a private tour in an AC passenger van with Victor Bodden tours, as we needed the flexibility with two young children who got hungry (and ate slowly) at regular mealtimes and napped in the afternoon. But, the original plan was to meet up with the lady from Familias Saludables to drop off a box of donated goods &#8211; since we were in the area, I had wanted to do something instead of just bask in cruise luxury. &nbsp;So, they were the perfect home for formula samples that I had and collected from&nbsp;freecycle, and since we missed Operation Christmas Child this year, it was nice to be able to pack a big box!). In my mind, I had thought that their organization was close to the port, so when I didn&#8217;t see the lady outside of the port gates, and their phone number wasn&#8217;t working, I was at a loss. Random tour operators hawking outside the gate would try to be helpful by calling the number, and asking me who I was looking for. Alarm bells went off when one of them, was like, &#8220;Oh! lady Valerie? Come here, I can show you&nbsp;to her building&#8221;. Yes, I admit, I started to follow him and left husband and daughter to wait but then politely thanked him when he pointed me to the building and turned around &#8211; because <em>stranger danger. </em>During this time, I find out that a member of the polizia tried to hawk a (pirated?) movie to j.w: &#8220;want a movie for five dollars?&#8221; Eventually, we went back inside the port and found the Victor Bodden kiosk.
Thankfully, the lady knew my itinerary and called them to say that she couldn&#8217;t make it, but I think forgot to tell them where to find their building. Victor had told her that we&#8217;d find them, so after going to a few spots (one being the address listed on their website and definitely not the first building that guy pointed to), our guide and driver&nbsp;finally found them with success! Turns out, their contact information is wrong on the website. The assistant told me that Valerie had a patient emergency and while I wished I could have stayed to chat a bit, the kids were in the car, so off we went on our tour.


<h3>Iguana</h3>


[caption id="attachment_5493" align="alignright" width="300"]<img width="300" height="225" class="size-medium wp-image-5493" alt="iguana stew" src="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/iguana-300x225.jpg" srcset="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/iguana-300x225.jpg 300w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/iguana-768x576.jpg 768w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/iguana-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/iguana-1568x1176.jpg 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /> You&#8217;re looking at a part of the iguana in the iguana stew[/caption]
Truth be &nbsp;told, I didn&#8217;t expect an independent tour&nbsp;English-speaking guide to&nbsp;jump in with our driver, as she&nbsp;spoke Spanish only.&nbsp;Reviews online suggested that the driver was the guide, so I felt pressured to up our tip, since Victor had&nbsp;advised me to give the tip to the guide, Gina (which he relayed to the guide when she asked him), as all the day&#8217;s fees would go to the driver. It was her second tour ever, so I&#8217;m not sure if that&#8217;s why we didn&#8217;t go to as many spots that I read about. When I asked her why only some tour operators were allowed to sell inside the port vs outside the port, she explained that the ones inside have some sort of arrangement (or license?); I forget the exact reason. They took us to a overlook to&nbsp;see a picturesque view, but it looked like every tour was there, and so were the vendors. By then, because of our later start in the morning, it was lunch so we asked her for a local restaurant recommendation. She suggested iguana. Sadly, it wasn&#8217;t quite the local restaurant we were expecting &#8211; we ate under zip lines and by caged monkeys and birds, and all the patrons were tourists. Surprisingly, the iguana stew (stewed in what tasted like coconut oil , served with beans and rice with plantain) was one of the&nbsp;highlights of the trip, despite it being a stop for tourists; it tastes like a cross between chicken and fish (bones), which when I think about it makes sense &#8211; tougher than fish, but boney because it&#8217;s a reptile. Later, the guide told us that men just go into the bush to hunt for them, and sites online suggest that they&#8217;re endangered because of this. j.w&#8217;s Google timeline tells me that we were at Jungle Top Adventures Zipline for our iguana meal &#8211; it all makes sense now &#8211; that&#8217;s why I remembered her saying something about &#8220;Randy&#8217;s restaurant&#8221; because one of the owner goes by that name.


<h3>Retail stops</h3>


After that, we made a quick stop at the cameo factory, because I was curious to see what it was about as it&#8217;s a cruise ship excursion stop and on the tour&#8217;s recommended list. One guy was in his shop etching designs onto a shell; the rest of it was just a retail shop. And there was no active tour, but as we were leaving, a bus pulled in and I overheard them say, &#8220;sit down and the presentation will start shortly&#8221;. Seemed like a typical Turkish rug+coffee, Chinese tea or jade, or Korean ginseng excursion stop.
We were then headed to a beach, but the kiddies fell asleep, so we opted to stop at the chocolate+coffee factory (Roatan Chocolate Factory) instead. Turns out, Roatan doesn&#8217;t have the best climate to grow coffee beans, so Honduras coffee is grown and roasted on the mainland. &nbsp;Again, there was no active tour or demonstrations, but I ended up buying a bag of coffee ($2 cheaper than at the port &#8211; we checked beforehand) and 5 bars of chocolate.


<h3>Beach</h3>

For whatever reason, the driver and guide wanted us to stop at West Bay beach where it&#8217;s $10 per adult which includes a beach chair, wi-fi and use of restrooms. We much preferred a local (free) beach, but after some prompting we were going to head that way. Thankfully, there was some shade at the side of the road right across the street from the chocolate shop at the West End, and j.w asked, &#8220;what about here? is it okay to pull over and park here?&#8221; So, we set up our beach tent under some palm trees (note: it gets quite warm because of the greenhouse effect) and Bean and j.w spent some time playing in the very calm water with maybe one or two others around and no solicitors; it was lovely.&nbsp;
We ended up back at the port an hour early, so we walked around and I took a chance and had a scoop of passion fruit gelato from a cart for $2US; it was refreshing. I&#8217;m kicking myself for not doing more research (I figured that&#8217;s what the guide is for) and asking for more photo stops, e.g. shipwreck or touch-and-go tour of the popular areas such as Sandy Bay, West Beach, Half Moon Bay, or at least tell me that&#8217;s where these are when we pass by them.


<h2>Harvest Caye, Belize</h2>


This was our least favourite stop.
[caption id="attachment_5501" align="alignright" width="238"]<img width="238" height="300" class="size-medium wp-image-5501" alt="Harvest Caye" src="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/harvestcaye-238x300.jpg" srcset="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/harvestcaye-238x300.jpg 238w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/harvestcaye-768x967.jpg 768w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/harvestcaye-813x1024.jpg 813w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/harvestcaye-1568x1974.jpg 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 238px) 100vw, 238px" /> Kayaking at the lagoon[/caption]
I spent some time talking about Harvest Caye <a href="http://her.happyhippos.ca/2016/12/western-caribbean-norwegian-getaway/">in my previous post</a>, and all we did was spend some time at the kids&#8217; splash pad area (despite knowing about recycled water) and used our $25 of our $50 free onboard credit to rent an open kayak to paddle around the lagoon. It was sunny and hot, and we actually managed to go around the lagoon in about 1/2 hour, with only j.w paddling (Bean sat in the middle, and I held the baby). Good thing we didn&#8217;t rent a $45 electric boat; although it had a canopy cover, we probably would&#8217;ve gone around in 10 minutes. Bean and j.w also went to play in the water on the beach, and I tried to take a seat on a beach chair, but I wasn&#8217;t thrilled with the number of wasp-bees around! No other place had that. We ended up going back on board to eat lunch as the restaurants there were not free.


<h2>Costa Maya, Mexico</h2>


[caption id="attachment_5481" align="alignright" width="300"]<img width="300" height="200" class="wp-image-5481 size-medium" src="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/tropicante-300x200.jpg" srcset="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/tropicante-300x200.jpg 300w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/tropicante-768x512.jpg 768w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/tropicante-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/tropicante-1568x1045.jpg 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /> Front row seats to the beach and water and solicitors at Tropicante[/caption]
Our favourite stop, which is telling because we got back on the ship with about 15 minutes to spare. Most of the day was spent relaxing under palm trees or in the water at beach in front of <a href="http://www.sandalsandskis.com/tropicante.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tropicante</a> at the Malecon in Mahahual &nbsp;&#8211; debated between this one or Blue Kay from reviews online. Anyway, Tropicante had the most excellent instructions on how to get there without falling into the trap of getting on a shuttle bus ($3 vs yellow cabs past the port gate for $2 per person). After stepping outside the port gates, it was very quiet in contrast, so you sort of wonder if you&#8217;re going to the right place. Thankfully, the yellow cabs were within a short walk, and they got you right to Tropicante. I was a bit hesitant about booking this place because of the taxi ride over and about not bringing the car seats, but even with one car seat, we didn&#8217;t belt our child in (gasp, I know!) and ended up holding them in our car ride over in a 16-passenger van (taller seat backs so I felt a little(?) bit better) but on our way back, it was just a Matrix. Steve, the owner, was right though &#8211; it&#8217;s slow, one-lane, short drive to and from the port. While not a good enough excuse, I&#8217;m thankful nothing devastating happened; thank God for his grace and protection!
[caption id="attachment_5495" align="alignright" width="225"]<img width="225" height="300" class="size-medium wp-image-5495" alt="Tropicante" src="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/coconut-e1482388388957-225x300.jpg" srcset="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/coconut-e1482388388957-225x300.jpg 225w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/coconut-e1482388388957-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/coconut-e1482388388957-1568x2091.jpg 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" /> Fresh coconut and guacamole[/caption]
We had reserved a few loungers under the shade, and while it was relatively quiet in the morning, more people came in the afternoon but not to the point where it felt crowded. The $6 guacamole was delicious without onions, and each $2 coconut was worth it (and cheapest around if you don&#8217;t count tip); for every order of coconut, they actually took a ladder to a tree and climbed it to chop down a coconut. Eventually, we discovered we could eat the flesh inside the coconut as well! mmmm. &nbsp;I think we ordered 3 or 4 coconuts, especially after Bean almost drank an entire one to herself. Service was excellent, although&nbsp;we seemed to have missed the owner; he introduced himself to those at tables, who also happened to be older (and caucasian). The ladies restroom was also very clean; I felt bad tracking sand and dirt on the floor! j.w and Bean spent time in the water; little guy and I spent some time there, but stuck around the loungers more. j.w ventured past the boundary to look for fish while snorkeling, on the advice of the staff &#8211; no wonder he mentioned something about hope he doesn&#8217;t die out there.
We both tried a massage &#8211; j.w got a lady from the restaurant next door (didn&#8217;t realize they&#8217;re affiliated with restaurants until afterwards), and she told us it was $15 for half hour, and $25 for an hour. j.w didn&#8217;t tip figuring it all goes to her pocket, but when I went with Tropicante&#8217;s massage service, it was $20 for half an hour and $30 for an hour, plus an additional tip. It was nice to feel the open-air warm breeze, with sounds of the beach but the massage was a relaxation one, that was nothing in comparison to a RMT, plus it was a bit awkward to be face down with your top off.

The shops along the Malecon (strip between the shops and the beach) all seem the same after a while: restaurants and souvenir shops. And, it got really hot under the sun when we weren&#8217;t next to the ocean or under shade, so we only walked a little bit after our time at Tropicante. On the way back, in the port village, we stopped to watch a demonstration where 4 men climbed a tall pole and spun to come down. j.w climbed a fake Myan ruin tower and ended up getting a great view around him.


<h2>Cozumel, Mexico</h2>


<img width="739" height="416" class="alignnone wp-image-5502 size-large" alt="Cozumel" src="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/cozumel-1024x576.jpg" srcset="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/cozumel-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/cozumel-300x169.jpg 300w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/cozumel-768x432.jpg 768w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/cozumel-1568x882.jpg 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 739px) 100vw, 739px" />Although we could&#8217;ve seen a Mayan ruin, I decided to use it as a walking around day, as the better ruins required you to take a ferry across and I didn&#8217;t know how the kids would be &#8211; flexibility was the key.
[caption id="attachment_5497" align="alignright" width="225"]<img width="225" height="300" class="wp-image-5497 size-medium" alt="Starbucks" src="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/starbucks-e1482389021847-225x300.jpg" srcset="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/starbucks-e1482389021847-225x300.jpg 225w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/starbucks-e1482389021847-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/starbucks-e1482389021847-1568x2091.jpg 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" /> A Chocolate Mexicano and what looks to be my name&#8230;[/caption]
We walked a long way to the local farmer&#8217;s market, but was disappointed to find that the restaurants in there only accepted pesos and there wasn&#8217;t much in terms of shopping other than produce and raw fish and meat. Eventually, we just found a random Mexican place to eat lunch, but it was close to $30 US for a platter (and mosquito bites) that we shared and a glass of horchada ($8?); at least it tasted homemade. Cozumel was also where we were told that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebozo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">rebozos</a> were sold in Mexico city and&nbsp;Yucatán, and not in these parts of Mexico. The best and most surprising find was the drinks at the Starbucks. WHO KNEW. I had avoided visits to chain restaurants, but we had gone in to look at the menu, and I had come across a Chocolate Mexicano. After conversion of 19 pesos to 1 American dollar, I ordered a tall, iced version; it was a delicious $3 spiced (but not spicy) chocolate drink that wasn&#8217;t too sweet even though I didn&#8217;t order it half sweet like most Starbucks drinks. &nbsp;So much so, that I came back for another cup &#8211; this time, I inquired about the price of a grande and venti, and after conversion, they came to the same price of $4! Yes, I got myself a venti. I debated between this and a mango passionfruit frappucino, but like the barista said, the frap is&nbsp;a sweet blended drink (ie. smoothie), so I don&#8217;t regret it, especially knowing that they didn&#8217;t sell the mix in a powder form (my mom inquired on my behalf when they went on the same cruise 2 weeks later). Actually, even the espresso based drinks come out to be cheaper than Canadian prices after conversion!
We originally had planned to stop at MEGA, the supermarket that you could see from the ship because we often find unique food items at local grocery stores. But after encountering the places that only took pesos, j.w decided he didn&#8217;t want to walk there only to find out they didn&#8217;t take US or credit card. Turns out, this port and supermarket is the crew&#8217;s choice to get off the ship for snacks and chocolate and yes, they do take American dollars! Too bad.


<hr />
And this brings us to the end of another family trip, and first cruise and birthday for the little guy, and the end of three months of having j.w off on parental leave with us. Already looking forward to the vacation days he has to take before the end of next month. :)]]&gt;		</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				<![CDATA[Since this entry started getting really long, even for me to read, I've decided to break it up into parts. &nbsp;While <a href="http://her.happyhippos.ca/2016/12/western-caribbean-before-and-after-the-cruise/">the previous post</a> covered the time before and after the cruise, we focus on the cruise ship experience in this one, and the next one will cover what we did at the port stops.
[caption id="attachment_5436" align="alignnone" width="739"]<img class="wp-image-5436 size-large" src="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/NCL_Getaway-1024x767.jpg" width="739" height="554" srcset="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/NCL_Getaway-1024x767.jpg 1024w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/NCL_Getaway-300x225.jpg 300w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/NCL_Getaway-768x575.jpg 768w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/NCL_Getaway-1568x1174.jpg 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 739px) 100vw, 739px" /> Norwegian Getaway at Cozumel, MX[/caption]
Of the five or so cruises I&#8217;ve been on, this would probably be the first one where I didn&#8217;t feel any sea sickness; I did feel like I was still rocking on land at times, but no noticeable discomfort while at sea &#8211; hurray! Sadly, j.w had stomach discomfort&nbsp;for most of the cruise, but he ploughed through it, and still did stuff with the family regardless. Because we were travelling to areas that have reports of Zika, the cruise line offered DEET-based mosquito repellent at no charge at guest services, which was a nice gesture.
One pet peeve: why are&nbsp;there misspellings everywhere on board? I realize that the majority of service employees on the ship may not have English as their first language, but Norwegian Cruise Line is a company with headquarters in Miami, so English should be its first language and typos just detract from a professional ethos. The&nbsp;marketing and brand correspondence should reflect positively on your&nbsp;company, including correspondence from companies that partner with you; &nbsp;that is, Park West Gallery, the art auction company on board can&#8217;t even spell <a href="https://www.ncl.com/ca/en/harvest-caye" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Harvest Caye</a> correctly in their marketing flyers to the ship&#8217;s guests&nbsp;[their version? &#8220;Harvest Cay&#8221;] &nbsp;&#8211; that&#8217;s the newest private island that NCL has branded and developed. Especially since we were only the second sailing to make a call there, you&#8217;d think NCL would want to make sure its name was spelled right. Speaking of which, we almost &#8220;bought&#8221; a &nbsp;piece of art at the art auction; somehow they &#8220;recorded&#8221; j.w not lowering his hand in time (with the rest of the room, as everyone started out with their hands raised) and a piece was thus &#8220;sold&#8221; to us; we didn&#8217;t know until they sent us a letter to our stateroom that we had not paid the invoice. Other examples include menu descriptions that are cut off (e.g &#8220;garlic toas[someotherdescription]t&#8221;) and sentences in the daily newsletter (e.g. &#8220;you hard desires&#8221; [&#8220;your heart desires&#8221;?]).


<h2>Embarkation and disembarkation</h2>


If we thought waiting to board the ship was a long time, disembarkation and customs took over 1.5 hours. Some even complained on Cruise Critic and Facebook that it took them 4 hours. This is why I could never book a flight leaving on the same day we arrive; it&#8217;d be too stressful.
Embarkation took a lot time &#8211; we made it during our assigned chosen check-in time (actually, j.w and Bean did &#8211; the rest of us were assigned a later slot), but everyone was sitting in a waiting area in the terminal waiting to board the ship. By the time the first people were let through, people found out their staterooms weren&#8217;t ready yet so everyone mad rushed to get lunch &#8211; either at the buffet, Garden Cafe, or the sit down restaurants Taste / Savor.


<h2>Cruise Critic</h2>


[caption id="attachment_5440" align="alignright" width="300"]<img class="size-medium wp-image-5440" src="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/IMG_20161129_165603-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" srcset="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/IMG_20161129_165603-300x225.jpg 300w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/IMG_20161129_165603-768x576.jpg 768w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/IMG_20161129_165603-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/IMG_20161129_165603-1568x1176.jpg 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /> With compliments from the hotel director[/caption]
Speaking of Cruise Critic, try getting in on the <a href="http://www.cruisecritic.com/rollcalls/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">roll call</a> &#8211; because that&#8217;s where I discovered that they had an exclusive Cruise Critic meet and greet where you get to meet and chat with the officers / management, so that you get their information if you need to escalate any issues. j.w mentioned to the hotel director that our room had a bump below the carpet (felt like a snake of wires), and when we later went to the room, a complimentary chocolate trio plate&nbsp;from the hotel director was waiting for us. Turns out it was sent via his assistant; the director didn&#8217;t actually know what was wrong with the room but he apologized that he couldn&#8217;t do anything more for&nbsp;the ship was full. They also served some light refreshments with complimentary drinks, including smoothies, but I found them to be very sweet.
Some on the &nbsp;Cruise Critic roll call organized a cabin crawl, which was great because we got to see a studio cabin and its exclusive lounge (the hotel director seemed to have just picked a random cabin) &#8211; the mood lighting almost reminds me of a spacey dorm room &nbsp;or a really spacious room on a plane &#8211; the toilet is literally a water closet; it looks like a space capsule and very claustrophobic. They have one-way windows that look out to&nbsp;the corridor, and you can opt to purchase a connecting cabin (and the $100 last minute prices for a studio cabin would make that very worthwhile). Other Cruise Critic guests offered their cabins for us to preview: a mini-suite is essentially a balcony cabin with a few more inches of room and a double sink, some of which have a tub shower instead of just a stand-up shower, and an accessible aft-balcony is almost 1.5x the size of a regular cabin, but I chatted with another guest at the meet and greet who was in a scooter and her accessible&nbsp;balcony cabin was likely two cabins in width!


<h2>Food</h2>




<h3>Main Dining Room(s): Tropicana / Savor / Taste</h3>


[caption id="attachment_5437" align="alignright" width="300"]<img class="wp-image-5437 size-medium" src="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/NCL_Dinning-300x216.jpg" width="300" height="216" srcset="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/NCL_Dinning-300x216.jpg 300w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/NCL_Dinning-768x554.jpg 768w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/NCL_Dinning-1024x738.jpg 1024w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/NCL_Dinning-1568x1130.jpg 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /> That&#8217;s because nobody spells &#8220;dining&#8221; like Norwegian[/caption]
Main Dining room food was mediocre at best. When you have a different dessert menu every night, but only one or two is repeated, and you find yourself ordering the same thing every night (i.e molten lava cake), then should have an idea just how ehhh&nbsp;the food is. I applaud them for allowing me to pre-order my meals ahead of time due to my allium intolerance as they prepped the dishes during the day, but that meant I was committed to eating at one of the main dining rooms the following night. However, ordering a plate of plain, grilled chicken breast or a steamed or broiled fish filet and a variety of steamed vegetables or even a plate of avocado, served to be quite the challenge &#8211; it seemed to boil down on who your server was and their pull in the kitchen (or whether they can inquire on your behalf) &#8211; this was very much unlike all the other cruise ships we had been on, and perhaps this is the huge drawback of freestyle dining; servers don&#8217;t remember your preferences and orders. I recall that the Maitre&#8217;D (Azim) and server on Celebrity went out of their way to ensure that Bean had &nbsp;a great meal when she was still a baby on a restricted diet. I&#8217;m not sure whether my diet restrictions affected the end results, but vegetable pad thai isn&#8217;t supposed to taste like lo mein saturated in soy sauce &#8211; whatever happened to the low sodium request or the tamarind (or ketchup at the minimum!), and although the beef tenderloin in the beef wellington was nice and tender, I was expected a puff pastry around the&nbsp;meat, but&nbsp;nope, it was just a piece of meat and veggies. I ordered a tonnado carpaccio-like veal appetizer, and out comes a roma tomato salad, but the worse part is that the server thought that it was a tonnado dish, which tells me that they don&#8217;t even know what the dishes are supposed to look like!
We had made advance reservations, but we ended up doing walk-ins due to the (slow? lack of?) service at Taste; can we say it left a bad taste? (ha!). After trying all three, I think the dining experience is just the luck of the draw, based on which server you get. The atmosphere at Savour and Taste seemed similar, more casual but quiet, whereas Tropicana seemed more formal (dimmer lighting) but also louder with the nightly live-music entertainment on the dance floor, including some performances by Burn the Floor.


<h3><strong>Garden Café</strong></h3>


Maybe it&#8217;s because this ship is newer, but I really liked the added touch of washing basins / sinks at the entrances of the buffet; it&#8217;s easy to wash your and the kids&#8217; hands without having to visit the restrooms.
A good variety of food was offered at the buffet, and made some attempts at some international food (I liked the Indian style curries more than the Chinese attempts, but possibly because I&#8217;m not Indian; the naan bread though seemed more like unleavened bread &#8211; the texture wasn&#8217;t quite there), and even offered a pot of self-serve chai tea (tasted like watered down evaporated milk with ginger tea than the spiced chai I usually encounter) at the buffet bar &#8211; it wasn&#8217;t with the rest of the beverages, so you had to have happened upon it, or someone told you. I really enjoyed the ox tail stew with plantains when we were at Harvest Caye for the day.
There was a team of very enthusiastic staff at Garden Cafe, who would often greet guests with a song or two at the entrances with one guitar in hand, accompanied by backup singers. On one occasion, they even stopped to sing little brother the birthday song on his birthday; what a treat!


<h3>O&#8217;Sheehan&#8217;s</h3>


The host didn&#8217;t know of chicken and waffles on O&#8217;Sheehan&#8217;s complimentary pub &amp; grill (even though online descriptions mention it as a dining feature) and the breakfast I ate there was what I could get at the buffet &#8211; clever name though: Irish twist to &#8220;Ocean&#8217;s&#8221; which j.w &nbsp;had to point out before I got it, so we didn&#8217;t go back.


<h3>Others</h3>


Shanghai&#8217;s only opened for dinner, didn&#8217;t allow for reservations or carry away/take-out orders, the tall tables weren&#8217;t toddler / baby friendly, and it always seemed full, so we didn&#8217;t get a chance to try their Asian-style dishes either.&nbsp;If food and dining service was a hit and miss, why would I pay a&nbsp;premium to try their specialty restaurants; that is, paying more for potentially equally mediocre&nbsp;experience? I did toy with the idea of getting my espresso coffee fix at the café/gelato/sweets and pastry shop, but the&nbsp;18% service fee on&nbsp;a $2.95 cappuccino deterred me away.


<h2>Entertainment and Play</h2>


Norwegian Getaway is a relatively new big ship, at 2 years old. At Deck 7 and 8,&nbsp;you can take a selfie at a photo kiosk and send it to any email address for free, which is a neat way to say hi&nbsp;to&nbsp;people at home and a nice modern touch, since getting reliable wi-fi wasn&#8217;t the greatest unless you paid $7.95 for 15 minutes.
Despite it holding 4000+ passengers and crew, the play areas never felt full &#8211; but for a ship that size, central areas like the pools and theatre seemed quite small. While we didn&#8217;t end up having the chance to go down any waterslide, the lines for them and for the other activities including the ropes course, bungee trampoline, spider mountain (a net where you climb to slide down a loop slide), mini golf didn&#8217;t seem very long at any given point. All of these seemed to be targeted for younger cruisers (like their competitors &#8211; maybe knowing that&#8217;s where the money is these days), with the exception of mini-golf, where I can see my parents doing; the rest I can&#8217;t.
I didn&#8217;t think I would do the ropes course, but seeing that my fear-of-heights husband did it without&nbsp;much apprehension, I had to try it &#8211; plus, there&#8217;s a zip &#8220;line&#8221; at the end. The harness really makes it tame and very safe; it looks scarier to walk the 8ft plank than when you&#8217;re actually up there &#8211; I recall having some of these ropes on childhood play structures above the ground, and there were definitely no harnesses and people did get injured (though a friend tells me that she jumped and broke her leg, and not fall through the ropes). You do need closed toe and heel shoes (yes, even water shoes without socks), and a sleeved shirt &#8211; maybe so that the harness wouldn&#8217;t chaff against your shoulder?
Sadly, the climbing wall was only open for limited hours (usually during nap time or dinner time), and I didn&#8217;t end up trying it either. They require&nbsp;socks and dry clothing, but provide climbing shoes and helmet for you at the rock climbing wall (so you might wish to bring and wear a bandana).
Notes:&nbsp;the loop waterslide has a minimum rider weight of 99lbs &#8211; if you don&#8217;t meet that requirement and depending on what you wear, you might not make it around the loop and have to escape through the emergency hatch at the bottom of the loop; I didn&#8217;t even try to attempt. The sign for the bungee trampoline says that the maximum weight was 80lbs even though their marketing says it&#8217;s for kids and adults, so while I had wanted to try it, I didn&#8217;t. It wasn&#8217;t until after the cruise that when I searched online for photos of adults trying it (because what adult is 80lbs?! I may be close but still didn&#8217;t meet the requirement), that I saw people post photos of a previous cruise where they had a piece of paper taped over the 80lb correcting it to 160lb. That made more sense &#8211; as j.w said, I should&#8217;ve just asked them &#8211; though I didn&#8217;t want to embarrass myself in front of some kids so that&#8217;s probably why I held back anyway.&nbsp;
I would also say that&nbsp;the private island, Harvest Caye, belongs under this category as I see it as an extension of NCL.&nbsp;Unlike the other ports, this island had a very artificial feel to it &#8211; with a &#8220;nature&#8221; center consisting of a few cages of&nbsp;animals, pristine sand, beach chairs crowding the beaches, a tiny lagoon for rented boats, stand up paddle board and kayaks, a pool with a swim-up bar, and potted plants. I felt bad for the lone staff manning a very empty ropes course &#8211; why would someone walk so far and pay for a ropes course when there&#8217;s a decently free one on board? The worst idea on that island though is probably recycling the water in the children&#8217;s splash pad / water park &#8211; we all know that some kids end up swallowing water when they play hard &#8211; especially down a waterslide, and other kids end up well, having accidents in the water when they play hard. You&#8217;d also think they would plan for having enough water on a hot day; the water level became too low for them to continue to operate the kid&#8217;s waterslide.


<h3>Kid-friendly activities</h3>


<img class="size-medium wp-image-5438 alignright" src="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/NCL_JrRopes-225x300.jpg" alt="Junior Ropes Course" width="225" height="300" srcset="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/NCL_JrRopes-225x300.jpg 225w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/NCL_JrRopes-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/NCL_JrRopes-1568x2090.jpg 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" />Twisty slides and trampolines are two things that excite our little one, but she had to be 43 inches tall and while she had fun on the little rope course, she was definitely a&nbsp;bit scared even with the harness (and bit her lip when she slipped). I was a little disappointed at the Guppies room (0-3yo free play), as it hardly had enough room for two families to supervise and play, and they didn&#8217;t have a toy lending program unlike the Celebrity Millennium, but I appreciated the structured time they had set out for 0-2 year olds with their caregivers; we unfortunately missed most of them though as it conflicted with our lunch or dinner times. While they had a great program for&nbsp;children 3 years and older at Splash Academy, including a final theatrical performance by the kids, Bean didn&#8217;t take to it so well and refused to stay / go after the second day. She really enjoyed the soft foam splash pad area though, and it was enclosed, which was a nice touch to keep the kids (and water) in.


<h3>Performances</h3>


To be honest, I didn&#8217;t understand <em>Burn the Floor</em>&nbsp;feature performance (just looked like a mish-mash / showing off of all ballroom dance genres) and the music from <em>Million Dollar Quartet</em> wasn&#8217;t my cup of tea, so when our kids seemed more tired than usual, we weren&#8217;t too disappointed to miss it even though we had reservations. And because of kid bedtime routines starts around 8:30 PM, we usually had to call it a curfew after that time &#8211; so we didn&#8217;t see the complimentary comedy shows or other events in the evenings either.
&nbsp;
Overall, it seemed less pretentious that Royal Caribbean&#8217;s <a href="http://her.happyhippos.ca/2013/03/eastern-caribbean/">Allure of the Seas grandioso&nbsp;experience</a>, maybe being less pretentious outweighs the other not-so-positives. When researching prior to the cruise, forum posters talked about NCL&#8217;s change of policies such as restricting any liquids to be brought on board, but according to some conversations I had with service staff, it seems like they also made changes&nbsp;for their staff: with vacation requests extending beyond&nbsp;2 months is more rare and evaluated according to&nbsp;seniority; it also seems the staff have less say in preference as to which ship to work on after each contract. Thus, more of their lives are spent on board than at home (often leaving family at home) and if they work well with a team or certain team members and are very familiar with one ship, they may have to relearn everything. Be warned that service staff may still be on shift / duty despite showing signs of a cold or a flu; I overheard the manager at the internet desk&nbsp;explaining that he was sick so he shouldn&#8217;t&nbsp;shake his co-worker&#8217;s hand. Sure enough, he was holding a wad of tissue and sadly, that was after I had already let my little one pound on the keys at the internet cafe. I made sure to wash his hands after, but maybe that&#8217;s where he caught the cold from, and didn&#8217;t get signs until the cool Miami evening breeze at the beach, thereby affecting everyone else in the family.&nbsp;

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				<![CDATA[A&nbsp;shiny new <em>family</em> car sits in our garage.&nbsp;And as it turns out, life doesn&#8217;t always go as planned: I&nbsp;was supposed to drive&nbsp;my first&nbsp;car into&nbsp;the ground before buying another; <del>my</del>&nbsp;our next car was to be&nbsp;a used one, not new;&nbsp;<em>and</em>,&nbsp;no way&nbsp;was I going to buy a minivan&nbsp;(even though he&nbsp;wanted one)&nbsp;&#8211; I would choose a SUV, even a pick-up truck&nbsp;over a minivan if we had to go up in size (but not a crossover, because I don&#8217;t understand the point of those).&nbsp;But my reluctance eventually became a compromise: this one is smaller than a typical minivan and&nbsp;we found a friend willing to buy our old car, one that has served us well for the past 10 years. j.w is happy because he gets to drive a new car, which he has always wanted but never&nbsp;had before <em>and </em>he gets a <del>minivan</del> mini-minivan / microvan &#8211; in red too!
And so,&nbsp;we&#8217;ve joined the Mazda family.


<h3>Pros and Cons</h3>


There aren&#8217;t many vehicles to choose from that meets <del>our</del> my requirements if we were going to upgrade: Asian make (American cars are infamous for breaking down sooner and European cars tend to be more expensive to maintain), more than 5 seats,&nbsp;spacious, drives okay, smallish, easy for children to get&nbsp;in and out &#8211; or to carry in and out. The nice-to-have sliding doors really limited our choices down to one car that wasn&#8217;t&nbsp;as big as a&nbsp;minivan: the Mazda5 &#8211; but we were okay to forego that had we found something better. In terms of form factor, it&#8217;s not the most stylish vehicle around but contrary to popular opinion, we&nbsp;actually prefer this generation&#8217;s look over its&nbsp;earlier&nbsp;counterpart&nbsp;as I didn&#8217;t like the vertical lights which gives the perception that&nbsp;car is&nbsp;taller and spacey.&nbsp;&nbsp;The price of the vehicle seems more affordable than those than fit 6+ passengers in other classes (crossovers, SUVs, minivans, pickup trucks)&nbsp;but comparable in price point to the Kia Rondo; I was just surprised that the base price of this vehicle was about the same price of my &#8217;05 Civic SI sedan &#8211; either prices of cars haven&#8217;t gone up much in&nbsp;10 years, or Honda vehicles are valued so much higher than Mazdas (which would make sense as well)! Compared to my mother in-law&#8217;s van (Sienna), it feels more agile and zippy, which I like because it feels more like I&#8217;m driving a regular car still.
The downsides?&nbsp;Fuel economy rating isn&#8217;t the greatest for a vehicle this size&nbsp;as other bigger cars outperform it and it seems to be on its&nbsp;way out: Mazda discontinued the manual transmission (not that we drive it),&nbsp;US&nbsp;has already&nbsp;phased it out, and&nbsp;2016 and 2015 models are exactly the same (minute differences in&nbsp;curb weight and fuel economy, and a $500 difference in price), and as an everyday&nbsp;vehicle, practically, it&#8217;s only a 4-seater; the other two seats take up cargo space and isn&#8217;t the most ideal for long(er) legs (ie. adults).&nbsp;I was a little surprised to&nbsp;find that it seems like&nbsp;more of a no-frills vehicle, with&nbsp;little compartments to store items in &#8211; especially up front &#8211; compared to my old Civic, and even to the Rondo.&nbsp;&nbsp;I just hope that the Mazda reputation for rust will not follow vehicles in this generation; the sales person&nbsp;tried to assure me that quality has gotten better since its Ford partnership and the fact that&nbsp;it is&nbsp;manufactured in Japan.


<h3>The Test Drive (and&nbsp;Purchase)&nbsp;Experiences</h3>




<h4>Mazda</h4>


When I initially agreed to test drive this car, I was somewhat hoping that I wouldn&#8217;t like it as I had my reservations about Mazda; that it would&nbsp;feel too big or bulky and their service&nbsp;would be like <a href="http://her.happyhippos.ca/2005/06/car-shopping/">my first test drive experience with a Mazda3 (at a different dealership)</a>, but surprisingly, that wasn&#8217;t the case.&nbsp;&nbsp;A couple of months had passed, and I&nbsp;didn&#8217;t know whether&nbsp;there was any progress&nbsp;with&nbsp;either&nbsp;dealership discussions&nbsp;or on the sale of our car and to me, it seemed&nbsp;that time was running out&nbsp;because&nbsp;year-end stock&nbsp;tends to&nbsp;dwindle by&nbsp;the fall (in favour of clearance prices and&nbsp;next year&#8217;s models)&nbsp;and&nbsp;I had thought it was almost time for our friends&#8217; to become new parents (and by extension, life momentarily stands still). I was indifferent about whether to upgrade our car or not&nbsp;&#8211; it was more so an opportunity than a need. I didn&#8217;t feel like we were very aggressive in terms of negotiation, but some searching on the internet and unhaggle.com gave us a ballpark on what to expect in terms of invoice price and the lowest prices (one site rated room for negotiation as 27% or marginal) and we ended up negotiating&nbsp;by asking for&nbsp;accessories &#8211; which we could&#8217;ve gotten as a cash discount, but we opted to keep the accessories that were on our wish list anyway. It&#8217;s a good thing that j.w asked about tinted windows, because she ended up throwing that in too. By the end of the day, we heard that they are supposed to make at least a $400 profit on a vehicle and at least 10% profit margin on accessories &#8211; whether that is true or not is what we don&#8217;t know. We also appreciated that they offered a courtesy trade-in service, so that we could save on being taxed full price on&nbsp;our vehicle (and the buyer&nbsp;will have&nbsp;to pay tax anyway). This experience was a much more pleasant one &#8211; the salesperson seemed knowledgeable and patient enough, to the point of offering&nbsp;stickers and crayons&nbsp;for the toddler, and&nbsp;offering to&nbsp;read the manual from cover to cover out loud&nbsp;for us (though she says no one has taken up her offer yet). They even provided a CarProof report on our old vehicle (based on the VIN) for our friend to review! Though,&nbsp;I&nbsp;am still&nbsp;surprised&nbsp;that it showed that my car was in a police-reported accident in <em>Ottawa?</em>! I was the only owner and driver of my car at the time of the report (August 2006), and a search through Gmail suggests that I was in KW the weekend it allegedly happened because I offered a friend a ride to a farewell party. If&nbsp;the left front of my car was damaged in an accident and the police was involved, wouldn&#8217;t I remember?


<h4>Kia</h4>


From the time of our first test drive to our purchase date, my sister and brother-in-law decided to sell their Fit (also to someone they knew) and buy up. They were originally looking for a used vehicle, but the dealership&#8217;s offer for a new&nbsp;Kia Rondo&nbsp;ended up being very near their asking price, plus extra accessories and service perks to boot! (like lifetime car washes and oil changes). They raved so much about their new car that we decided to test drive one, since this generation&#8217;s Rondo is different from the 2011 one that I test drove years ago. Maybe we gave off a different vibe, but it seemed like the Kia salesperson wasn&#8217;t really interested in negotiating&nbsp;or trying to accommodate us either. I was especially surprised that they gave us a 5-seater Rondo to test drive&nbsp;and when we asked&nbsp;for &nbsp;a 7-seater, they just told us that the third row is practically useless and wouldn&#8217;t fit any adults. They did try to up sell us a Sorrento, which seats 8, but I felt so claustrophobic in the back &#8211; as if there was no room to escape / harder to get in and out with the high second-row seats. I was also surprised the sales person sat in the vehicle on our test drive, which makes me feel that I&nbsp;can&#8217;t discuss things with&nbsp;my husband&nbsp;as freely. I was surprised that I didn&#8217;t like the 2015 as much as the 2011 one &#8211; despite it looking more stylish. As a short person, I found my feet hung off the ground on the passenger seat (and you can&#8217;t adjust the vertical height) and the dashboard seemed really deep with really thick/chunky A pillars, so despite heated seats and other nice defaults, it wasn&#8217;t a favourite of mine.
So while we could&#8217;ve test drove other cars, we didn&#8217;t.


<h4>Delivery Day</h4>


My husband and I tend to share some similarities but usually he is happy to just go with the flow; I am the opposite. As a planner, I like to be control or at least aware of what&#8217;s going on, and being punctual (even though I find myself late too often). During most of this process, I felt that my hands were tied and that I was constantly asking j.w&nbsp;about updates or the status of where we were at in our conversations with either the dealerships or the buyer because I was minimally involved (except I was&nbsp;the&nbsp;one responsible for the paperwork and pickup)&nbsp;&#8211; <em>is that how a project manager feels? (if yes, then I&#8217;m even more&nbsp;thankful that&nbsp;<a href="http://her.happyhippos.ca/2007/12/mysteries-of-project-management/">I&nbsp;didn&#8217;t&nbsp;end up on&nbsp;that path</a>).</em>&nbsp; At times, I felt like we were playing broken telephone: I would pass on a message but then it either was ignored or misinterpreted, or that I was told one thing but changes happened last-minute whether it was the salesperson telling me she didn&#8217;t need to see the car in-person, but expected to last-minute (because of an incident that happened during the week that required a change in policy), or j.w sending me to get the car&nbsp;safety-ed and&nbsp;e-tested&nbsp;an&nbsp;hour before I&nbsp;was supposed to complete the&nbsp;buy-and-sell transaction, waiting for the shop to complete the work,&nbsp;figuring out the logistics in terms of payment, pickup and drop off points, and then&nbsp;rushing from an unfamiliar location in Cambridge back to the dealership, which basically meant I had negative buffer available to use to get to the appointments&nbsp;on time.&nbsp;Additionally, had I known that our friend was going to get the winters mounted, I would&#8217;ve probably asked j.w to change it first to save them money. You know I&#8217;m stressed when I begin to compare this to wedding planning&#8230;
At least I&nbsp;learned a few&nbsp;new things&nbsp;while waiting at the mechanic our friend uses:&nbsp;a) high mount lights are the brake&nbsp;lights at the top of your car&nbsp;&#8211; I didn&#8217;t&nbsp;even know they weren&#8217;t functioning&nbsp;and&nbsp;wonder how&nbsp;long they have been out for (and&nbsp;grateful yet curious why no police officer&nbsp;pulled me over for that); b)&nbsp;they are also used by Forward church (for their vans) &#8211; a big church in Cambridge; and, c)&nbsp;at the end of the appointment, someone&nbsp;seemed to&nbsp;recognize me &#8211; I think maybe from a dinner party at a friends&#8217; place in Cambridge a few nights earlier.
So, it&#8217;s goodbye Honda, hello Mazda. I pray that we can bless others with&nbsp;this car too&nbsp;&#8211; just maybe not driving&nbsp;people&nbsp;to and from hockey (which my car was used for a lot during the first few years). We&#8217;ll see where the next 10 years takes us&#8230;!]]&gt;		</p>

				<![CDATA[]]>		]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				<![CDATA[A few weeks ago, the main branch of the Kitchener Public Library invited Matter of Taste owners, Phong (and Dawn) Tran, to give a quick coffee-brewing workshop to a dozen or so guests. While I have experienced horrible customer service multiple times at the coffee shop itself (including with one of the owners) and have since stopped going (which saves me a bunch as we often opted to treat ourselves to Dawn's special - the MoT pricier version of Vietnamese-style iced coffee), I commend them for crafting out time to share their insights with us.
At the end of the night, I was surprised to discover that even if you use the same beans and the same weight of grind, depending on which method you use to make a cup of coffee, the end results can be so varied in look and taste. It's also amazing how much more fragrant freshly roasted and ground coffee is! Our samples were from Ethiopia, roasted a day before and ground that evening.
From my observations*:


<ul>
    

<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AeroPress" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Aeropress</a>: coarser grind, paper filter, hand pressure
Result: clean, no sediment, sweet after taste, dark in color, my favourite choice
If you don&#8217;t have an espresso machine, you can get a cheater espresso with this device</li>


    

<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_press" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">French press</a> (commonly associated with the Bodum brand): coarsest grind, mesh filter &#8211; push down a bit first so grounds can soak and aerate &#8211; then let it sit for a few minutes before slowly plunging it the rest of the way
Result: sediment at bottom of cup, lighter in color, similar in body/taste as Aeropress
So if going for the same taste as Aeropress but want to save $ for the equipment, this would do / be a happy medium</li>


    

<li><a href="http://coffee.wikia.com/wiki/Pour-Over_Filtration_Brewing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pour-over</a>: paper filter &#8211; rinse with hot water first to take out chemicals in filter and to warm up the receptacle
Result: Tasted more acidic (&#8220;citrusy notes&#8221; was how Phong described it). Clean, but I didn&#8217;t like the taste.</li>


</ul>


Alas, I was too busy drinking up the shots, keeping mental notes and comparisons, and trying to keep up that I forgot to take photos for visual reference.
*Note: Certain flavours&nbsp; may be more apparent to some and preferences may differ but the remark about different methods, different results hold true.]]&gt;		</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				<![CDATA[Tomorrow marks the last day of this challenge and it sure wasn't easy being constrained to being intentionally local, especially when others around you aren't. The most frequently asked questions were, "<em>is this [considered] local?</em>&#8221; and &#8220;<em>why are you doing this?</em>&#8221;
The second question is a bit easier to answer: aside from the <a href="http://www.baileyslocalfoods.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">free year&#8217;s membership to Baileys Local</a> and to support and participate with the community, I wanted to see if it would take a lifestyle change to live locally. With only a day to go (and $12 for cheating between the two of us, the biggest culprit for us being online entertainment like streaming and reading non-local blogs and eating), I&#8217;ve concluded that being exclusively local can be easy in some ways, but it would not work long-term for us if we had to do it day in and day out. T&#8217;was not for naught though, as we happened upon a few new discoveries along the way (<a title="#livelocalkw: Coffee &amp; The Great Outdoors" href="http://her.happyhippos.ca/2014/09/livelocalkw-coffee-the-great-outdoors/#comments" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@SKL</a> &#8211; this part is for you!): a place that sells beeswax (for my baking experiment that will hopefully happen), <a href="http://ambrosiapastry.com/about-us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a shop that sells <span class="st">canelés</span> (!)</a>, <a href="http://www.baileyslocalfoods.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">one more online option to order local/organic food</a>, and the manager that ran the sushi and sandwiches at the now-defunct Casa Mia is selling sushi (and other items) at the Y Café at the CIGI campus beside it (so not all is lost!)!
In our quest to stay local this week, we discovered that not everyone defines local the way we do;&nbsp; for example, a well-intending parent tried to convince us that Ontario corn and carrots bought at a Walmart in Toronto counts as being &#8220;local&#8221;, and while Ontario-grown produce is great, Walmart is far from being local on my list, even if it had been bought at the Walmart in KW and even if Walmart employs staff that are from the city.
And while there are plenty more great places around town to eat, shop, and play local, the following three ties up this blog series:


<h3>Eat</h3>


Generally speaking, I don&#8217;t like paying for cold sandwiches (or grapes, honeydew, cantaloupe, muffins, veggies that can be found on a veggie tray, har gow or siu mai) &#8211; this likely stems from eating deli sandwiches for lunch throughout most of primary and secondary school because our family owned a soup and sandwich restaurant and catering business (har gow, siu mai from daily dim sum lunches with the grandparents while in HK). However, I still enjoy hot sandwiches and the occasional cold ones &#8211; usually ones that don&#8217;t have deli meat in them.&nbsp;
I especially like the housemade bacon-based sandwiches made at <a href="http://breadbaron.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">breadbaron</a>, a take-out stand that took over <a href="http://indulgekitchen.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Indulge Kitchen</a> at the Kitchener Market, but they cycle through a few sandwiches every so often, which makes sense as they can ensure fresh ingredients and do it well. . One perk is that after you order one sandwich, they give you a $1 off coupon to be used on a subsequent purchase there!


<h3>Shop</h3>

Well, since this is the last of the series, here are three other places apart from the typical supermarket chains that we buy our fridge and freezer food from:


<ul>
    

<li><a href="http://www.stecklehomestead.ca" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steckle Heritage Farm</a> when in season, sells their farm-grown veggies and root vegetables. Last year they had a novel concept where you just pay what you can or what you feel like it&#8217;s worth, but this year, they seem to have priced their harvest reasonably (and pay by honour system).&nbsp; The produce stand just sits near the entrance and is open to the public on Tuesdays between 3-7pm</li>


    

<li>Sustainable360.ca doesn&#8217;t require a membership fee (unlike Bailey&#8217;s) and while the selection isn&#8217;t as vast as Bailey&#8217;s, they do offer products that Bailey&#8217;s doesn&#8217;t sell and on par or cheaper than its online and in-store competitors (I&#8217;ve compared blueberries from the same farm, same volume, and it was $1 cheaper here than Bailey&#8217;s)</li>


    

<li>and a honorable mention to <a href="http://www.caudlescatchseafood.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Caudle&#8217;s Catch</a> &#8211; because I miss the seafood from Vancouver. Seafood isn&#8217;t local, but they do sell quality seafood, including wild-caught fish from the Great Lakes in addition to a variety of other farmed and wild fish (and other frozen and fresh seafood). While they are not swimming in a tank like Asian supermarkets, they get shipments weekly and they often look fresher than the dying fish in those tanks anyway; they will also gut and clean/scale the fish for you in store, and can cut up a whole fish for you the way you like it, if you give them a day or two notice (e.g. filets and steaks)</li>


</ul>




<h3>Play</h3>


I love that our library is not just about books:


<ul>
    

<li>You can borrow books, movies, even video games!</li>


    

<li>I can use our city libraries without having to leave the house. How?


<ul>
    

<li>The Kitchener library system lets you download unlimited e-books, magazines to keep, two songs to keep twice a month, and lets you stream movies (twice a month)</li>


    

<li>You can search online for an item (from both cities) and place a hold on it to be delivered to your preferred library for pick-up (but you need to return the item to a library of the city it belongs)</li>


    

<li>They email you when your item is ready to be picked up and when upcoming items are due back</li>


</ul>


</li>


    

<li>The beauty of our libraries is that you can get both a Kitchener and a Waterloo library card</li>


    

<li>Aside from parking and fines, all their services are free!</li>


    

<li>Programs, films, talks, including family-friendly activities</li>


    

<li>Media space and use of a 3D printer (limited to 3hrs a day)</li>


</ul>


&#8212;
Well, I hope you enjoyed this series. Maybe you&#8217;ll consider taking up this challenge sometime or check out some of these places too if you haven&#8217;t already?

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				<![CDATA[One of the great things about living in Kitchener-Waterloo is that you don't need to go far to eat, shop, or play. Perhaps it is partly because of this that one of friends can say that Waterloo isn't about the scenery or the pretty buildings, but about the community that brings the people and the city together (I'm glad that others have come to <a title="Talent Attraction Lab" href="http://her.happyhippos.ca/2011/11/talent-attraction-lab/">this same conclusion</a>).
Yesterday, the little one and I deviated from her regular routine and instead of a morning nap; we headed over to our neighbourhood community centre to play with toys and make new friends.&nbsp; Today, I participated in a free, lively workshop (hosted by Employment Ontario) about money saving ideas in and around town and was inspired by other like-minded people who have even better methods of saving money / finding a good deal (so I&#8217;m not the only crazy one out there <a href="http://bec4-beyondthepicketfence.blogspot.ca/2012/05/pallet-bench-tutorial.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">who wants to turn a palette into a furniture piece!</a> sadly, I don&#8217;t have any tools nor have I the woodworking experience).
In this morning&#8217;s daily #livelocalkw email, we were asked, <em>how do you feel about your community when you eat, shop, and play local?</em>&nbsp; Aside from being able to support the livelihood of those in the community, by being intentional, the faces around you eventually become people you know instead of strangers who you may only interact with once or twice (or maybe not&nbsp; at all for those transactions done over a screen).
Today&#8217;s picks:


<h3>Eat</h3>

Uptown Waterloo&#8217;s <a href="https://www.facebook.com/aromacafewaterloo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Aroma Café</a>, <em>not</em> to be confused with the Toronto-based Aroma Espresso Bar franchise chain, is a small coffee shop that is tucked away in the upstairs of the building beside Angie&#8217;s Kitchen. But don&#8217;t think that it&#8217;s just another &#8220;coffee&#8221; shop; Kiki, the owner, is super-friendly and aside from making their own blends of coffee beans (which they discount off every few days to keep their supply fresh), I love that she puts her own twist in traditional Korean bibimbap, using atypical ingredients like beets, turnip, avocado, and alfalfa sprouts so that the dish tastes super fresh and is full of &#8220;gourmet&#8221; vegetables. I&#8217;ve concluded that any of her Korean-style takes are simply delicious, because her rice cakes and kalbi pockets were tasty too.&nbsp;


<h3>Shop</h3>


One of our regular weekly destinations to shop on Saturdays is the Kitchener Market. We go to get locally grown vegetables, eggs, and other good (non-local) deals. We also find that the average price at this market cheaper than the one in St. Jacob&#8217;s, perhaps it is because it feels less touristy and has fewer vendors. Like the St. Jacob&#8217;s market, many vendors will also mark down their fresh food to clear their stock by the end of the day (10 minutes prior closing, which is around 2pm).


<h3>Play</h3>


Community associations/centres and recreation complexes provide quality programs at affordable prices; for instance, the caregiver + tot drop-in down the street from us costs $1 each time we go.&nbsp; Depending on the community association, you can find a range of offerings, from fitness and sports like <a href="http://www.kitchener.ca/en/livinginkitchener/Lyle_Hallman_Walking_Track.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">indoor running tracks</a> (free!), badminton and ballroom dancing to art and cooking classes. Our neighbourhood association even throws a yearly party for the community, bringing live entertainment, music, and bouncy castles!
Even if you&#8217;re not participating this challenge, how do <em>you</em> feel when you eat, shop, or play local?]]&gt;		</p>
