								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				For our first vacation without kids, we went to Indianapolis. <em>for. a. gaming. convention</em>. Yup. I tell people that I had thought we were doing Chicago paired with this (as it&#8217;s on my roadtrip list), but it turned out to be only this. And, in hindsight, probably wise that it was only this, as this was a spending vacation, and by the end of it, we ended taking home some new games, some promo packs, enamel pins, and a few litres of local beer.<br />
Gaming seems to have become more popular over the last few years. Case in point: I spent more time at the convention <a href="http://her.happyhippos.ca/2010/08/indianapolis/">than the first time,</a> the US border guard actually plays Magic: The Gathering (he asked what j.w thought about Core 19), and our server at Payne&#8217;s in Gas City plays Pokémon GO.<br />
<figure id="attachment_6621" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-6621" style="width: 763px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="wp-image-6621 size-full" src="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/steps.png" alt="" width="763" height="383" srcset="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/steps.png 763w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/steps-300x151.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 763px) 100vw, 763px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-6621" class="wp-caption-text">Recorded steps during Gen Con</figcaption></figure><br />
This year, because we were at an airbnb that was almost a 40-minute walk away, we decided we needed to get there between 7-8am to get a spot at the Circle Center Mall garage, which was a few dollars less than neighbouring parking garages. This meant that I woke up too early every day and walked over 20K steps the first two days (when my average is usually between 7-10k) so by the time day 3 hit, I was quite exhausted by 10pm in addition to being tired in the mornings. This also meant that while learning to play Roll for the Galaxy: Ambition (the expansion), I accidentally &#8220;rolled&#8221; my cup of coffee instead of my cup of dice. Gaaah.</p>
<h3 id="firstHeading" class="firstHeading" lang="en">Pre-Gen Con</h3>
<p>I got the most steps on Wednesday, likely from walking through the 100 Acres: The Virginia B. Fairbanks Art and Nature Park, Newfields, walking back to our car from kayaking along the canal, checking out the Stink (a pre-con meetup) to get some freebies and waiting in line for our badges.<br />

<figure id="attachment_6620" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-6620" style="width: 169px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="size-medium wp-image-6620" src="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_20180801_113732-169x300.jpg" alt="" width="169" height="300" srcset="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_20180801_113732-169x300.jpg 169w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_20180801_113732-768x1366.jpg 768w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_20180801_113732-576x1024.jpg 576w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_20180801_113732-1568x2789.jpg 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 169px) 100vw, 169px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-6620" class="wp-caption-text">Park of Laments: a long rocky corridor to reach an enclosed dead end. Photo credits: j.woo</figcaption></figure><br />
I really enjoyed the walk in the park and interacting with the art installations mixed in with nature, like hovering rings and sloped yellow benches, but it was too bad that a few installations seem to have disappeared and the path around the lake was closed due to erosion. There was this one place called &#8220;<em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Park_of_Laments" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Park of Laments</a>&#8221; </em>and it was truly a fitting title as you had to enter a narrow tunnel surrounded by two walls of rocks to get to an enclosed park area where it was essentially a dead end. A less depressing piece titled, <em>&#8220;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Funky_Bones" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Funky Bones</a>&#8221; </em> actually had me humming, &#8220;these dry bones, these dry bones&#8230;&#8221;  (from what lyrics / songs I don&#8217;t know, but they&#8217;re a reference to Ezekiel 37:1-14).<br />
I&#8217;m glad that we finally got to visit the park since it was on a my to-do list from last time, along with visiting the canal. Last time, I saw the surreys for rental on my way to the zoo, but I&#8217;m glad my friend (another j.w!) was willing to do tandem kayaking with me instead! I was a tad nervous as it was my first time in a kayak / canoe without a life jacket but when I asked about life jackets, the rental place said it was only 3 ft deep and comes up to the chest &#8211; and yes we were fine.<br />

<h3>Food and Drinks</h3>
<p>The food truck food around the convention centre was mediocre at best this year, but here were some unexpected finds:<br />
<figure id="attachment_6627" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-6627" style="width: 194px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="wp-image-6627 size-medium" src="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/DSC_1606-e1533879040733-194x300.jpg" alt="" width="194" height="300" srcset="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/DSC_1606-e1533879040733-194x300.jpg 194w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/DSC_1606-e1533879040733-768x1185.jpg 768w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/DSC_1606-e1533879040733-664x1024.jpg 664w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/DSC_1606-e1533879040733-1568x2419.jpg 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 194px) 100vw, 194px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-6627" class="wp-caption-text">Landos: a double shot of espresso with a vegan peach and rose whipped cream topped with golden sprinkles. Perfect dessert with a caffeine kick to continue gaming through the evening</figcaption></figure></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/paynesrestaurant/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Payne&#8217;s</a>, an eclectic place serving British eats in Gas City, between Indianapolis and Fort Wayne. I came across it as we were driving down and wanted to stop at a place to eat, so I googled something like, &#8220;dinner along i-69 towards Indianapolis&#8221; and found this gem of a place!</li>
<li>Bee coffee roasters across the street from the convention. I was able to get 10% off with a coupon each time (<a href="https://www.visitindy.com/web_coupons/377" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">I printed multiple</a> after pasting screenshots multiple times into one document with MS Paint) and on my 3rd purchase, they took my address down for a free Bee Coffee Roasters 6d die (they had issues with shipment not arriving before the con); <a href="https://www.tinkercoffee.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tinker Coffee Co.</a> also had some good quality coffee, but only encountered their nitro cold brew from a local market (Wildwood) and the beans that our first airbnb provided</li>
<li>Tried fresh yellow (or was it blue) oyster mushroom from the 4-minute drive to Wildwood Market from our 1st Airbnb. That market had some neat local food choices so I made dinner on the first night with local ingredients: fungi, yellow cherry tomatoes, and some snow peas.<br />
<figure id="attachment_6626" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-6626" style="width: 225px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="size-medium wp-image-6626" src="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/riogrande-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300" srcset="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/riogrande-225x300.jpg 225w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/riogrande-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/riogrande-1568x2091.jpg 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-6626" class="wp-caption-text">Thank you for my favourite meal at Gen Con yet, Rio Grande!</figcaption></figure></li>
<li>Rio Grande shared their hot catered food with whomever was there, so we happened to be around for a breakfast and a couple of mid-day / later-evening meals. They had the BEST prime rib &#8211; coffee rubbed and marbled and cooked just right with an abundance of (much needed) vegetables and potatoes; this was easily our favourite meal (and a second dinner, after having some bar bites at Weber Grill earlier).</li>
<li><a href="https://greenleafjuice.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Greenleaf juicing company</a>: this place reminded me of Pure in DTK but I was happy to stumble across it even though it was pretty pricey, because I felt like I needed some greens in my diet to balance out the Con diet</li>

<p><figure id="attachment_6625" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-6625" style="width: 225px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="size-medium wp-image-6625" src="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_0698-e1533877572671-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300" srcset="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_0698-e1533877572671-225x300.jpg 225w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_0698-e1533877572671-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_0698-e1533877572671-1568x2091.jpg 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-6625" class="wp-caption-text">Deep-fried butter, a repeat from last time. Except he had them all&#8230;</figcaption></figure><br />
j.w took a break with me to check out the Indiana State Fair on Friday night, as I had wanted to see the hot air balloon parade, but due to winds, they couldn&#8217;t inflate so it was cancelled <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f641.png" alt="🙁" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />  Well, at least we saw a tractor parade, which was different than any parade I&#8217;ve seen. We also spent a lot on fair food anyway: a revisit of deep-fried butter (turns out that they have been around for over 20 years), deep-fried bacon (tasted like bacon that spent extra time in the pan, but the seasoning and not being too salty was great!), had a garbage burger again (pulled pork on top of pork patty &#8211; and yes, that&#8217;s what it&#8217;s called), and stumbled into the barn with Indy brews! We tried the mead and the blood orange IPA that was in the competition and we liked the latter so much that we headed straight for <a href="https://www.centerpointbrewing.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Centerpoint Brewing</a> right after. The bartender was super nice and let us sample a bunch (complimentary tasting) before we decidedly bought 2 6-packs of the IPA and a growler of the <a href="https://www.centerpointbrewing.com/beers-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Center Perk</a> (coffee stout). Here&#8217;s where he gets extra points: he remembers us on Sunday and welcomes us back, and when he learns our growler exploded in the car (which now smells of coffee and beer), he offers us another on the house [ref] Unfortunately, bad news: the limited run coffee stout was out so we would have to choose another. Sigh[/ref]</p>

<h3>Accommodations</h3>
<p>We decided to go to Gen Con fairly last minute (a few months before) so instead of hotels we went with Airbnb. Usually, if you want nearby accommodations, you go and book it a year before. We did get a chance to see that the Crowne Plaza Union Station had actual rooms in train cars while we were there! They converted an old rail station to a hotel.<br />

The parents put loving words into each scroll into a jar, so that when their child is older and needs a reminder of how much they love him, he can take out one to read it!</figcaption></figure><br />
We spent the first two nights in a refurbished house that smelled like stale cigarette smoke, with all the basic essentials &#8211; the neighbourhood looked more run down though with empty stores and 4 police cruisers and two on the ground in handcuffs just on the corner of our street.  The host had add some thoughtful touches such as leaving a bag of some local coffee (Tinker Coffee Co.), some emergency toiletries, and it was almost 5x cheaper for a much bigger space. Conversely, our last-minute booking during Gen Con days meant premium pricing everywhere &#8211; and the host was smart enough to leave town and rent out her unit in addition to the one she normally rents out in the same suite. I loved the stay at the smaller space &#8211; the decor, the comfortable linen and beds, the hair and body wash&#8230;and even the pool was suitable to use at night!</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Gen Con: Thursday through Sunday</h3>
<p>I started off my first day of Gen Con with two non-gaming mini workshops on the art and method of zentangle; everyone else stormed the exhibit hall when it opened. I had a great time doodling with a purpose! The rest of the day, I strolled through the exhibit hall collecting freebies, browsing the booths, and demoing a couple of short games.<br />
Other than me joining the audience to watch an interview with the puppeteer and voice of Big Bird and Oscar the Grouch (who knew that they were played by the same person!) and his wife [ref] &#8211; there was an entire puppet stream / track at this convention, and the puppeteer and voice for Kermit the frog and Ernie (both played by the same person) was also there which I missed! [/ref], for the next couple of days, j.w and I spent most of our time together to look around the hall and demo games (at the hall and CGE/Rio Grande rooms); I found myself playing more games when with another person around than on my own.</p>

We stopped for a bit to see the cosplay contest for the first time as we missed out on the parade as our True Dungeon game took longer than expected &#8211; wow, some people are truly dedicated at hand making their costume!</p>
<h3>Games</h3>
<h4>Notes for next time</h4>
<ul>
<li>the C n C booth resells Rio Grande games; you can bargain with them.</li>
<li>Cool stuff inc has a dings and dents (or last stock) shelf that they restock throughout the convention. You can also use the $2 off coupon in the coupon book with these games.</li>
</ul>
<h4>I would consider buying or playing again</h4>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/257527/trapwords" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Trapwords</strong></a> (coming out in the Fall sometime) &#8211; advanced taboo, best played with people you know</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgameexpansion/233891/ticket-ride-map-collection-volume-6-france-old-wes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ticket to Ride: France</a></strong>: the tracks aren&#8217;t colored ahead of time, so you use one action to assign a color <i>but</i> your opponents could claim it before you do!</li>
<li><strong>Roll for the Galaxy: Ambition</strong>: extra cards and goals to complete. I regret not picking this one up at $23 &#8211; $2 at the dents and dings shelf at Cool Stuff Inc. because I wasn&#8217;t sure how it would play and didn&#8217;t know its retail price (later found out it sold elsewhere at the convention for $40). If they reminded me of the $2 off coupon, I would&#8217;ve picked it up. Though, pro-tip, don&#8217;t do as I did: don&#8217;t play and drink for you might roll your drink cup (filled with coffee in my case) instead of your dice cup. Though now that I know Amazon.com has it for $24, thanks to someone telling me about <a href="http://boardgameprices.com">boardgameprices.com</a> at the consignment store, I don&#8217;t feel as regretful.</li>
<li><strong>King Domino: Age of Giants</strong> (expansion)</li>
<li><strong>drop it</strong>: quick game to play, can play with kids, but hard to master, but would only get it if it was on sale, as the sticker price was $30 USD</li>
<li><strong>Cities of Splendor</strong>: adds a bunch of expansion games to Splendor, but would only buy this if we get a copy of Splendor. We&#8217;ve been playing Splendor on our phones / tablet after a friend taught us how to play, but the feel of the game is nice</li>
<li><strong>Word slam</strong>: A team vs. team game where you use existing word cards to try to and get your teammates to guess the correct word without using any gestures or your voice. It seemed to get a bit repetitive after a few rounds, but I like word games, so I&#8217;d be willing to give this one another try.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Did not get a chance to try</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Queen Domino</strong></li>
<li><strong>King Domino: Age of Giants</strong> (expansion)</li>
<li><strong>Terraforming Mars</strong>: I heard it has a Race for the Galaxy feel to it!</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/244330/scarabya" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Scarabya</a></strong><a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/244330/scarabya" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> &#8211; by Blue Orange, the same publisher and designer of King Domino.</a> I did meet the game designer in person, and it was sort of interesting to see that everyone at the booth was from France except for one American, even though they have an office in Silicon Valley.</li>
<li><strong>trash pandas</strong>: I only found this intriguing because I like the art of Sushi Go and the others at the Gamewright booth like this one looked cute, and was sold out on the first day.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Games I tried that I probably wouldn&#8217;t pay money for</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Catan VR</strong> (needs an Oculus set first)</li>
<li><strong>Small World: Sky Island</strong> (too many pieces! would be more fun to play on a tablet or smartphone)</li>
<li>Other expansions of Dominion (too many cards! but fun to play anyway)</li>
<li>Escape-room type card games. I feel like these are one-time plays and thus a waste of resources</li>
<li><a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/141791/pinata" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Pinata</strong></a>: a two-player game that seems kid-friendly but gets really repetitive quickly (maybe that&#8217;s why it&#8217;s perfect for a mother-daughter game); the consignment store had it for $12</li>
<li><strong>Chicken Cha Cha Cha</strong>: relies on a lot of memory &#8211; great for a younger audience</li>
<li><strong>Codenames: Duet</strong> &#8211; is a fun game but the group game seems more fun</li>
<li><strong>True Dungeon</strong> (TD): when j.w played it the first time, he came home raving about it. I think with the rise of escape rooms, I&#8217;d rather spend my money there (works out to be around the same price per hour). TD was a RPG/D&amp;D+Escape room hybrid: you&#8217;re in the dark going from space to space with divider walls draped with fabric to match the theme to separate the rooms; there&#8217;s a dungeon/game master in each room that yells out scenarios and penalties and then some random actors dressed up in themed costumes. I randomly died in the middle of the game (turned into stone after a low die roll), which mean I couldn&#8217;t participate in 3 out of 6 or 7 rooms, so I feel like I got ripped off somewhat.I felt like there was little to no onboarding for new players (had no idea what happened, and when to dock myself life). At the beginning, we spent a considerable time trying to figure out what our given random tokens meant and how to suit up our character by trading our tokens with others as each one had a special ability or armour/weapon. I wish they explained it better that certain tokens are more valuable than others, such as the purple ones, which are ultra rare (1 in every 100 packs), so you don&#8217;t trade them away. Thankfully, j.w had played before so he pocketed the purple one that I had opened (instead of giving or trading it away) and later found out that it sold for $75, but the buy price was $35, so I guess we got back most of my game. At least I contributed to solving a puzzle fairly quickly before our time was up.</li>
</ul>

<ol>
<li><strong><a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/98229/pictomania" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pictomania</a></strong>, newest edition (surprised that it was j.w who wanted a copy because it&#8217;s a group game and you have to draw!) &#8211; a hybrid of pictionary and speed where everyone in the game participates at the same time.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/28620/phoenicia" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Phoenicia</a></strong> &#8211; by the same designer as Race for the Galaxy. Hadn&#8217;t heard of it &#8211; only picked up because it was $10 at the consignment store [ref] future note to self: every day a board game stays at the consignment store, it drops in price[/ref]</li>
<li><strong>Pressure Cooker</strong> &#8211; from Rio Grande, looks like Overcooked and for $10, it&#8217;s worth the try<br />
<figure style="width: 680px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="size-medium" src="https://geekandsundry.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/everdell.png" width="680" height="582" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Image from <a href="https://geekandsundry.com/build-your-new-home-with-critters-and-cards-in-everdell/">https://geekandsundry.com/build-your-new-home-with-critters-and-cards-in-everdell/</a></figcaption></figure></li>
<li><a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/199792/everdell" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Everdell</strong></a> &#8211; definitely my favourite game from our purchases. I hadn&#8217;t heard of this kickstarter game until we passed by the booth on the last day. The artwork was what drew me in first as it reminded me of why I read some graphic novels, then phrases like tableau building, worker resource placement, Race for the Galaxy meets 7 Wonders / Agricola were the right words to hear. This was a game I was willing to pay a lot of money for! The designer, James Wilson, and his wife was there explaining the game and signing the collector&#8217;s edition. I learned that they&#8217;re from Idaho and Gen Con was their first big-city experience. He does embroidery printing as his day job, and that he&#8217;s worked on this game for over 5 years now. They had hoped to sell 100 copies at this convention, but they had sold over 1000 copies by Sunday morning! (so far, I have yet to win a game though <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f641.png" alt="🙁" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> )</li>
<li><strong>Race for the Galaxy: Xeno Wars</strong> &#8211; turns out we already have this expansion, but we hadn&#8217;t gotten around to playing with the extra pieces yet, so I didn&#8217;t recognize the cards (but found the box to be very familiar &#8211; and that was why)</li>
<li><strong>Robits</strong> &#8211; a kid-friendly $3 game for $1 because we had a $2 off coupon</li>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				Our same friends (who we travelled with last time) had a last-minute spot open up in their suite, so we took the opportunity to fly down again to spend 6 days there. What did we do this time?<br />
Unfortunately, it rained every single day. Turned out that we had hit the first week of wet season. And when it rains, the frog-toads come out at night and they just sit there staring at you as you walk by or through their paths&#8230;</p>
<h3>Swimming and resort activities</h3>
<p>Because the resort had a really kid-friendly pools / water play area and some decent free activities to do in the mornings (like kinetic sand play), the kids spent non<span style="font-size: 1rem; background-color: transparent;">-rainy times in the pool; I even found the water-slide quite safe for non-swimmers like myself!</span><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<figure id="attachment_6580" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-6580" style="width: 700px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="wp-image-6580 size-full" src="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/marriottharbourlake-1.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="383" srcset="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/marriottharbourlake-1.jpg 700w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/marriottharbourlake-1-300x164.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-6580" class="wp-caption-text">One of the larger kid-friendly pools. A social commentary on what we&#8217;re seeing more and more: the couple on the left were interacting with their phones while enjoying their drinks instead of chatting with each other</figcaption></figure><br />
And when they were out of the pool, we attempted to play mini-golf but didn&#8217;t actually get through a game because of the poor weather. The resort also had a nice little gated play structure for kids to play on as well, which was under utilized and therefore great when Bean went on to play while her brother was napping back in the room.<br />
One unexpected activity that everyone took part in at around 830 AM in the morning was the false fire alarm, so everyone evacuated with bed head and sleepy eyes. Thankfully, it happened at 830 and not 3AM in the morning, and it wasn&#8217;t raining.</p>
<h3>Museums and science centers</h3>
<p><figure id="attachment_6561" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-6561" style="width: 225px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="size-medium wp-image-6561" src="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/climber-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300" srcset="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/climber-225x300.jpg 225w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/climber-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/climber-1568x2090.jpg 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-6561" class="wp-caption-text">Tampa&#8217;s Children&#8217;s Museum</figcaption></figure><br />
Before we left, our friend told us about a family membership at a science centre in BC with reciprocal memberships in Canada and around the world that you could buy online &#8211; and for 3 years, it didn&#8217;t even cost as much as 1 year at our local museum (which isn&#8217;t as great as the ones we&#8217;ve explored so far).  The caveat is that you can&#8217;t use it within 90 mile radius of your address and within 90 miles around the centre you bought it from, which means we can still visit Science World but not the Toronto Science Centre or London Children&#8217;s Museum with this membership. Seeing that we will likely make a visit to BC and Washington State in the next 3 years, we will definitely try to make sure to use this membership to visit Science World and the flight museum and the children&#8217;s museum in Everett!<br />
Anyway, we used this newly bought membership at Orlando Science Center and drove a little ways out (to sunnier and warmer weather) to Tampa Children&#8217;s Museum and spent two afternoons indoors, in air conditioning and sheltered by the rain. The kids seemed to have a great time, and I enjoyed going through the two places as well &#8211; my favourites were seeing the glee at the silk vacuüm tube in the Science Center and the sand sensory table (made possible by a kinect and a projector!) and the mesh climber at the Children&#8217;s Museum.</p>
<h3>Shopping areas</h3>
<p><figure id="attachment_6562" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-6562" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="size-medium wp-image-6562" src="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/DSC_0842-300x169.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="169" srcset="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/DSC_0842-300x169.jpg 300w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/DSC_0842-768x432.jpg 768w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/DSC_0842-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/DSC_0842-1568x882.jpg 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-6562" class="wp-caption-text">Soap bars at Basin, Disney Springs</figcaption></figure><br />
We also spent some time at the Florida Mall play spaces and walking around and taking the short ferry taxi around Disney Springs (and digging in the dino pit at T-Rex Cafe). For date night, j.w and I went back to Disney Springs to try a VR experience where you walk from room to room immersed in a Star Wars shooting adventure with Oculus packs. It was $30 for about 30 minutes, which I feel is a little steep but I think it was worth the experience. This time, I stopped in at Basin because I read online that you could get soap ends at a discount, and while they aren&#8217;t completely natural (though they do have a natural line), the soap bars look too cool and smell edible &#8211; they remind of Fimo tubes encased in glycerin; the Mickey ear silhouettes looked the most fitting!</p>
<h3>Food</h3>
<h4>Repeats</h4>
<p>We went back to the Southern BBQ place at Disney Springs, as well as Q&#8217;nenans. To my surprise, the FoH manager recognized us and welcomed us back! And then they threw in some chicken avocado mix when we just ordered the bread on the side; talk about excellent customer service! We also returned to Sweet Tomatoes twice, as the kids seemed to eat well there and the prices are very reasonable, especially with the buy $50 get $10 promo combined with a 25% off coupon &#8211; we found out that the prices actually vary depending on location, and the one in Tampa seems quieter and even cheaper than the one in Orlando (~$12 for soup-salad bar dinner).<br />
This time, at Disney Springs, I found a allergen-friendly bakery, but I forgot that I usually find the texture of gluten-free baked goods to be a bit off. Sadly, I also found their loaf cake / tea cake to be overly sweet and not moist enough.</p>
<h4>Fish</h4>

We also tried sushi on a belt at Florida Mall [ref] &#8211; this brought me back to high school or early university days when we went to eat at Metrotown / Metropolis which had a restaurant with this concept; it didn&#8217;t seem to stick around for very long [/ref], which the kids loved, and the pricing wasn&#8217;t too bad for the quality; you just had to know what to order so you wouldn&#8217;t be paying too much in the end. On the last day, we also went to a really good poke bowl place, with huge portions for a really reasonable price; it outshines any poke bowl places I&#8217;ve had outside of Hawaii so far.</p>
<h4>And more&#8230;</h4>
<p><figure id="attachment_6564" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-6564" style="width: 225px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="size-medium wp-image-6564" src="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/DSC_0873-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300" srcset="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/DSC_0873-225x300.jpg 225w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/DSC_0873-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/DSC_0873-1568x2091.jpg 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-6564" class="wp-caption-text">Cooking post-dinner at Wegman&#8217;s, a family-friendly grocery store</figcaption></figure><br />
j.w&#8217;s coworker recommended an Asian fusion burritos place, which she said was &#8220;life-changing&#8221; but I found it super slow (he explained as I was paying that a cook had walked out mid-shift) and it was quite salty, so it&#8217;s not on my list of returns. However, j.w&#8217;s cousin&#8217;s recommendation of Tasty Wok on Imperial / Asian street was quite authentic, despite the &#8220;steam table concept&#8221; name. Speaking of &#8220;steamed table&#8221; / hot foods table, in Buffalo, we stopped at Wegmans for dinner, and their battered fish was really crispy and just really good, except when I went back to get more, they were closing their food offering and had taken any left away <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f641.png" alt="🙁" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> What was really nice was that this Wegmans had a jazz trio playing and a relatively large kids&#8217; play area / corner so you could enjoy your food with live music and watch your kids playing, all for free [ref] plus they also stocked free diapers for emergencies including pampers pull-ups in their washrooms[/ref]!<br />

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				When I <a href="http://her.happyhippos.ca/2017/07/first-solo-trip-with-two/">went to Vancouver last year with two little ones</a>, I wanted to minimize the amount of gear I needed to carry. Thankfully my sister&#8217;s kids are the same size, so I was able to limit my luggage to just a carry-on suitcase, a backpack (with snacks and activities), one car seat, and a diaper bag. I didn&#8217;t have to take a car seat with me, but I decided that having one on board would be safer and better overall, so I had to find a way to lug it without needing to carry it.</p>
<h2>The suitcase stroller</h2>
<p>I looked online for ideas, and saw a couple of products to help mitigate this problem &#8211; one was a foldable trolley where you put the car seat (and child in) and the other was a strap that looked like a T where it attached the car seat to a carry-on suitcase. Well, I didn&#8217;t want to buy anything that was only useful in this situation or bring along anything extra (like the trolley), so I tried to use what I had to mimic the T-strap. A mom in a local mom&#8217;s Facebook group asked me to post some screens of my setup when she saw a photo of what I did, and j.w wanted to record a video of it, so he did a wonderful job of capturing my explanation, Bean and all:<br />
<iframe title="Suitcase stroller" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zbpq4FggdOs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe><br />
For those who don&#8217;t want to watch the unedited video, read on for some written instructions.</p>
<h3>Materials</h3>
<p><figure id="attachment_6504" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-6504" style="width: 225px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="wp-image-6504 size-medium" src="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/DSC_0154-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300" srcset="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/DSC_0154-225x300.jpg 225w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/DSC_0154-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/DSC_0154-1568x2091.jpg 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-6504" class="wp-caption-text">What you need before connecting everything together</figcaption></figure><br />
This is what I used &#8211; and what you might need:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>An adjustable luggage strap</b>. You might be able to get away without this if the LATCH straps on your car seat are long enough to wrap around to the back of the suitcase; mine cannot. It seems that Asian families back in the day were known to wrap their suitcases with luggage straps (to keep it together and to see it easier on the carousel, maybe?), so it was quite easy for me to find one lying around. I like this particular one because there is a loop in it that the carabiner clips in so it&#8217;s snug and it doesn&#8217;t move. I&#8217;ve also used a bungee cord in a pinch, when I left my luggage strap behind &#8211; but I didn&#8217;t feel it was safe to put a child in it then.</li>
<li><b>One carabiner</b>. If it&#8217;s weight supported (such as ones meant for climbing), it&#8217;s probably safer; mine&#8217;s not.</li>
<li><b>A key ring</b>, O-ring, or D-ring. You might be able to get away without this if the top tether can clip to the carabiner, but I find it much easier with it. Probably safer if it&#8217;s weight-tested as well. If you get rid of your luggage strap, you would need this so that the LATCH clips can clip/hook onto the ring.</li>
</ul>
<h3>The setup</h3>
<p><figure id="attachment_6503" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-6503" style="width: 225px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="wp-image-6503 size-medium" src="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/DSC_0159-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300" srcset="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/DSC_0159-225x300.jpg 225w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/DSC_0159-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/DSC_0159-1568x2091.jpg 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-6503" class="wp-caption-text">A closer look at what it looks like after everything is connected together</figcaption></figure><br />
A three-step summary:</p>
<ol>
<li>Match the back of the car seat against the front of the carry-on suitcase when vertically standing</li>
<li>Thread the luggage strap through the car seat where the seat belt would go for a forward-facing set up, and adjust so that car seat is snug against the suitcase. If there are handles on your suitcase, put the luggage strap through them (the video shows the straps are twisted &#8211; try to make sure they&#8217;re flat before continuing).</li>
<li>Take the top tether of the car seat and thread it through the handles on top of the suitcase and the handle bar (I pull up the handlebar to make it easier), and hook and clip the tether to the ring, or the carabiner, if you don&#8217;t use a ring. Tighten, tilt, and test it out.</li>
</ol>
<p>With the car seat strapped to the carry-on suitcase, I could either put all my stuff into the seat while Bean helped roll it, or she sat in it and helped hold some stuff, while I wore my 18 month old in a carrier. People looked our way, but I&#8217;m not sure if it&#8217;s because people haven&#8217;t seen others do this, and/or they were thinking what kind of crazy parent would do that. On Air Canada (Dreamliner specifically), I can roll this contraption down the aisle and get to my seat without undoing anything, but it does not fit down the aisle on WestJet or Air Canada Rouge planes &#8211; some will fit down business class but once you get to economy, you will quickly find out it doesn&#8217;t fit so it&#8217;s better just to undo it in the area where parents gate check their strollers and car seats. You will also need to buffer a little more time to take it apart and put it together again as you go through security screening.<br />
Happy travelling!		</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				<a href="https://flic.kr/p/21x7ka7"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/4582/38420739036_66e8ef2411_z.jpg" alt="The drive above the clouds" width="640" height="300" /></a><br />
Being in a time zone that is behind everyone else is quite nice: you wake up when the rest of the world is going about their day; it seems to complement well with Hawaii&#8217;s laid-back take in life. But being 6 hours behind meant that every day started early, and especially early for our son the first few nights &#8211; when the sun wasn&#8217;t even up yet. Strangely enough, I would actually have a normal bedtime, crashing before or by 11 pm.<br />
I wasn&#8217;t too sold on Maui when we booked our trip, as I didn&#8217;t really enjoy it last time we were here. But by the end of our trip, I told my sister that we should do this again in a few years; bonus points: the kids had a great time together (no crying in the church nursery)!</p>
<hr />
<strong>Highlights:</strong> Minimal diaper duty &#8211; yay, daddy duty!, local food (poke, ahi tuna, fish tacos, gelato / sorbeto in my case), super nice weather, walking distance to beautiful beach sunsets, laid-back vacationing &#8211; didn&#8217;t feel like our itinerary was jam-packed, even though we had activities every day, and because time change happened while we were gone, we had one less hour to adjust to coming back.<br />
<strong>Low lights:</strong> Lost luggage &#8211; it&#8217;s material but annoying that we lost our epipen, 2lbs of Kona coffee, a brand new jump starter battery pack, and a family photo in a photo frame with two bonus prints from Maui Ocean Center (because it was their first day and they were still testing the waters); I was feeling so smug about being packed for our next trip too. More about that in the next section.<br />
As my family was sick leading up to the trip, I finally got sick on the first day or two of the trip; what was nice that even though I felt perpetually cold inside because I was fighting a fever, I just had to sit outside for an hour or two to warm up. By the second day, I decided to buy some generic cold+flu medication and that helped tremendously.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Flights</h3>
<p>One downside is that Maui is very far &#8211; we chose to board three planes going there, and two coming back. For those on the West Coast, it makes sense, whereas we probably would fare better in the Caribbean &#8211; and maybe it was the time of the year, but the waves were a little too much for the little ones to enjoy. Thankfully, kids were great on the plane; while we had very little sleep, even on a red-eye flight, there were no major crying episodes. Because we stopped over at YVR on our way back, the rest of my family met us there for a quick catch-up over a short breakfast; it was extremely nice to be able to see them! For future reference, it takes about 1.5 hours to walk from the gate in Canada through security and customs to the US gate (and a pee break) with young children; we just made it for boarding.<br />
Strangely enough, after we boarded early and clipped in the car seats, a couple of passengers came on and told us that we had their seats. Sure enough, their boarding passes had the same seats that we did! As I went to try to sort it out with the flight attendants, we discovered that other seats and passengers had the same problem; they called it &#8220;seat tubing&#8221; (or something like that?!) but I couldn&#8217;t find what the problem was on Google. Thankfully, everyone ended up being seated in a seat, and we didn&#8217;t have to move.<br />
<a href="https://flic.kr/p/GsCdqx"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/4566/26555565439_874a9aae6d_z.jpg" alt="A beautiful view approaching YVR from the middle seat of row 19E #redeyeflights" width="640" height="480" /></a><br />
On our way back, at the luggage drop-off, the attendant offered to check-in a carry-on for us for free, so we took her up on the offer, as it meant that we didn&#8217;t have to carry it around with us in YVR. At YVR, the WJ folks were so nice to offer us a ride on a golf cart so that we didn&#8217;t have to walk the long walk from the gate to customs.  At customs, the kind security person just waved us over to the flight crew line and we bypassed 9 flights of passengers, just like that! I don&#8217;t know if we would&#8217;ve been able to sit down and have breakfast with my family otherwise; we only had about 45 minutes to do that even with the expedited process because our flight departed late.<br />
Because it was a carry-on, we had left some of the more important items in that suitcase (like our epipen) and didn&#8217;t have a &#8220;this belongs to&#8221; tag on it. Somehow, in our rush to pick up our luggage at YYZ, we forgot about it, and didn&#8217;t think about it until we got to our Toronto home. But, the airline had not seen it when we called, so somehow it is still missing. WestJet has graciously offered to settle with the amount we claimed or give us a little extra in WJ credits!</p>

<h3>Food</h3>
<p>Memorable highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li>Costco sold unique items like poke, sashimi (ahi and marlin), wild ahi and moonfish steaks, Japanese-style boxed and frozen mochi, coconut rolls, Kona and other Hawaiian coffee, local papaya</li>
</ul>
<h4>Sweet</h4>
<ul>
<li>Fruit stands on the side of the street:
<ul>
<li>Creamy, buttery, large <strong>avocadoes</strong> for $1</li>
<li><strong>Passionfruit</strong> &#8211;  2 for $1</li>
<li><strong>Miracle berry</strong>: makes everything sour taste like sour candy! A former co-worker told me about this, so when j.w saw them, I told him that 4 for $1 was worth trying, even if it was just for the novelty</li>
<li><strong>Starfruit</strong> &#8211; 2 for $1</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Maui Gold Pineapple:</strong> it must have been at the end of its season because by the last day or two, it sold from over $1.49 /lb to $0.88/lb for all available pineapple, which were mostly Dole ones; they taste different from Dole.</li>
<li><strong>Candy apple bananas</strong>: native to Hawaii, they have a tinge of orange to them, are slightly firmer, and have a fruitier taste; you can bring this and pineapples back</li>
<li><strong>Banana bread: </strong>yes, surprisingly, market stand banana breads are very moist and tasty; some are even dairy and nut-free!</li>
<li><a href="https://www.hawaiimagazine.com/content/crazy-kulolo-kauais-dessert-staple" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Kulolo</strong></a>: a sweet dessert that reminds of baked nian gao (年糕), made of taro, coconut milk, and sugar (and original recipes call for ti, whatever that is; even the <a href="http://www.geniuskitchen.com/recipe/kulolo-hawaiian-pudding-162954" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">modern recipes for kulolo</a>  seem quite labour intensive!)</li>
<li><strong>Sorbetto</strong> at <a href="https://onogelatokihei.com/menu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ono Gelato</a>: so much choice! If you aren&#8217;t dairy-free, the gelato options looked incredible too. If you have an entertainment book, there&#8217;s even a BOGO free coupon. There was another gelato place that had less choice in N. Kihei, that had a sweet potato coconut milk based sorbetto that was delicious, but I prefered Ono.</li>
<li><strong>Shave ice</strong> at <a href="http://www.ululanishawaiianshaveice.com/">Ululani&#8217;s Hawaiian Shave Ice</a> &#8211; the <strong>mochi topping</strong> was so soft and chewy. I prefered this over Local Boys, as Ululani&#8217;s claims to use real fruit-based syrup but Local Boys uses artificial syrup, even though the one at Lahaina had excellent service; not only did the gal at Local Boys Lahaina give free samples for us (no buying expected), she even gave me half of her pitaya smoothie, because I had asked about it but that side of the store was closed.</li>
<li><strong>Pineapple beer. Pineapple wine.</strong> Good thing neither of them got lost.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.vitacoco.com/products/coconutmilk/original" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Coconut milk beverage:</a> unsweetened and very creamy delicious, especially the Vita Coco brand; I can&#8217;t find it here it seems</li>
<li>Wow Wow Hawaiian Lemonades has freshly squeezed lemonade with toppings and other fruits (and entertainment book discounts and happy hour special pricing)<img class="wp-image-5991 size-full alignleft" src="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/37448161314_4356da751d_z.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="360" srcset="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/37448161314_4356da751d_z.jpg 640w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/37448161314_4356da751d_z-300x169.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></li>
</ul>
<h4>Savoury</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fresh poke</strong> at the grocery store, Costco, fish restaurants; ranged from $12/lb to about $18. Fresh poke meant ahi tuna, marinated in a variety of sauces like shoyu, wasabi, spicy mayo; cheaper poke (and other fish variety) could be had but they were previously frozen</li>
<li><strong>Spam musubi:</strong> even the ones under the heat lamp at the grocery store tasted delicious. I had seen them on a prior trip but hadn&#8217;t tried it before. Shame that I couldn&#8217;t try deep-fried spam musubi at Da Kitchen (has dairy in it).</li>
<li><strong>Pork fried rice</strong> at <a href="http://kiheicaffe.com/menu.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kihei Cafe</a>: sadly, we didn&#8217;t get a chance for a repeat visit. There&#8217;s a kid-friendly room for families to sit and eat (and draw on tables) but it was a little chilly with the air-conditioning on, so we ended up moving to one of the outside patio tables.</li>
<li>Ahi (poke)-stuffed calamari at Cafe O&#8217; Lei: such a casual sounding, punny name for a fancier restaurant!</li>
<li>We also liked Coconut&#8217;s Fish Cafe for their fish tacos, and everyday value &#8211; the Azeka location had better service, but the Kihei one had a lot more space (I&#8217;d prefer the service over space). You can ask me for my toss-away phone number for their points if you go, so you can take advantage of discounts and freebies.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Beaches</h3>
<p>I&#8217;ve discovered that you can be a beach person without needing to play or wade or splash in the water; sitting on the sand is just as nice. Perhaps it was the time of the year, but almost every beach on the map had waves that were quite strong, especially for the kiddies to play in.<br />
<a href="https://flic.kr/p/GBiyBt"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/4525/26653774689_7060878b87_z.jpg" alt="Sunset escape" width="640" height="427" /></a><br />
Comments on the beaches we visited, with my favourite at the top:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://goo.gl/maps/WehMHhAttm32" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Unnamed &#8220;secret&#8221; beach</a>: walking distance away from where we stayed &#8211; there was a walking trail that led to it from the road (no parking). The rocks broke the waves and it was a nice quiet due to the secluded spot; this was easily my favorite spot for the kids and to watch sunsets.</li>
<li><a href="http://mauiguidebook.com/beaches/baby-beach/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Baby Beach</a>, not the one in Lahaina, but the one by Paia: a wall of rocks break the waves so that they don&#8217;t crash onto the shoreline. This also allows for some shallow swimming and snorkeling opportunities to see turtles. Unfortunately, a few beach visitors did not heed the dogs-must-be-leashed rule and our kids were kissed by two really hyper (likely young) and free-roaming dogs (the owners were not in sight when they came up to us), and that pretty much ruined that visit for them. At least the owners leashed them up after this incident.</li>
<li>Charley Young Beach: if you walk it, you can walk to Kamaole I, II, III from Charlie Young; it&#8217;s less busy than Kamaole beaches, but all are good spot for sunsets</li>
<li>Kamaole III beach advertises a park playground but it&#8217;s really only a set of swings; the better playground is at Kalama Park, which is next to Cove Beach, a seemingly popular spot for SUP and surfers.</li>
<li>Kapalua Bay Beach: we were looking for Napili Beach but couldn&#8217;t find the signs for them, so we found this one instead. I wouldn&#8217;t recommend it as it had limited parking, lots of people, and deep fryer smells like onion rings wafting in our direction. However there was plenty of shade to sit under.</li>
<li><a href="http://mauiguidebook.com/beaches/makena-big-beach-oneloa/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Makena Beach</a>: a very long beach &#8211; it takes a while to walk from one parking entrance to another along the beach. It was so windy there that our beach umbrellas blew away; this was where a local told us that the current was stronger at this time of the year &#8211; something to do with leeward / windward tradewinds? [Ed. I hadn&#8217;t read the comments about this beach until now, but it seems the strong currents are normal here]</li>
<li>Kenolio Beach: conveniently located across the street from Ulanani&#8217;s, so if you go near sunset, you can grab a shave ice before it closes and then enjoy the sunset or walk across to look for turtles along the pier (and stay dry while at it!) during the day. Next time, I hope to be able to join this group to go <a href="http://www.kiheicanoeclub.com/guest16.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">paddling on their outrigger canoes</a>!<a href="https://flic.kr/p/21x8pTd"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/4548/38420950046_c41dec15b0_z.jpg" alt="A turtle&#039;s head pokes out of the water" width="640" height="480" /></a></li>

<h3>Beautiful Drives</h3>
<p>These drives aren&#8217;t necessarily for the faint of heart, but if you go slow, drive carefully and be alert, the breath-taking scenes make it worthwhile. If you attempt any of these, I would recommend driving during daylight hours as there are no street lights, minimal guard rails, and little to no shoulder; in fact, you might have to share a lane with oncoming traffic.<br />
In order of perceived danger (considering factors like narrow lanes, tight turns, unpaved roads, proximity to the cliff, cattle crossing, weather) where the top is probably the safest:</p>

<strong>Haleakala Highway</strong> to the volcano&#8217;s summit (10,023 feet says the sign): the roads look maintained, relatively wide and has reflectors, but here are some things to watch out for &#8211; especially if you&#8217;re driving up for sunrise or driving down after sunset:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cattle crossing: cows just wander onto the road</li>
<li>Weather changes from warm at the base to super windy and cold near the top (e.g. from 26C to 9C); it could also change from sunshine to rain</li>
<li>Fog (or when you&#8217;re driving through the clouds): when it&#8217;s bad, you can barely see anything in front of you; it also just randomly shows up even if it&#8217;s clear as day at the top or at the base</li>
<li>Roll down the windows, open the vents when you see forest trees around you, and you&#8217;ll be able to take in the fresh eucalyptus smell; mmm, breathe it in!</li>
</ul>
<p>Even if you don&#8217;t go during sunrise or sunset, you will feel like <a href="https://flic.kr/p/ZqQmXE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">you&#8217;ve landed on Mars</a> once you get to the top!</li>

<strong>Pi&#8217;lani Highway:</strong> otherwise known as <a href="http://mauiguidebook.com/adventures/haleakala-backside-kipahulu-to-ulupalakua/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">backside of Road to Hana/Haleakala</a>. The recorded path on the Google Timeline map doesn&#8217;t look as bad as the one above, but it is known for its narrow, and unpaved and uneven roads (single to the point of needing to back up if you meet oncoming traffic), tight turns, and risk of landslides and washed out (resulting in closed) roads in wet weather; thus, I would recommend not taking this route if it has rained at all. Most recommend taking it clockwise so you are not driving on the side of the cliff. At one point, if you are driving slowly enough and then stop on the side and walk over, you can actually see an abandoned vehicle (I keep thinking it&#8217;s a white jeep) that has crashed and fallen off the cliff. At the slowest point, it took us almost 2 hours just to drive 37 kms (with a few stops but quite minimal since we were trying to get out of there before dark and catch up to the other car). The drive reminded at times of the California coast, the Cabot trail in the Maritimes, and what I&#8217;d imagine coastal drives in Europe might be like.<br />

<strong>North of West Maui</strong>: After going through Pi&#8217;ilani and <a href="http://mauiguidebook.com/adventures/west-mauis-north-shore-kapalua-to-wailuku/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reading the reviews and comments about this route</a>, j.w decided it wasn&#8217;t worth it, so we skipped it. The other car was going to attempt it but opted to let their kids play at local beaches instead on the day we went up Haleakala. However, we did drive the part from Lahaina to Nakaele Blowhole before we did Hana, which was probably one of my favourite activities on this trip as I got some hiking in (though j.w got the worse of it as he took one in arms, and one in a backpack hiking carrier UP the rocks) and we saw the <a href="https://flic.kr/p/ZjLm5x">blowhole in action</a> (sadly, I can&#8217;t say the same at Waianapanapa State Park as all we saw was the sign that day); I didn&#8217;t dare to go too close as I was paranoid about being sucked in &#8211; due to the stories circulating online. The drive, though winding at times, didn&#8217;t feel so bad, so I&#8217;m going to assume that it gets bad after the blowhole.</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<h3>Worth mentioning</h3>
<ul>
<li>Maui goes all out on Hallowe&#8217;en: so many costumed characters and almost every place has a treat for the kids. Who needs to go neighbourhood trick o&#8217; treating when you can head to a local mall; you even get treats from restaurants too&#8230;</li>
<li>Wild roosters and chickens seem to roam free everywhere</li>
<li>You can watch hula dancing by keiki (kids) for free (put on by the hula dancing school) at the Cannery Mall</li>
<li>Hawaii state law prohibits touching turtles, so leave them alone if you see them with you in the water!</li>
<li>Whale watching: we tried twice without any luck &#8211; since whale spotting was guaranteed &#8211; once from Maui Ocean Center docks and the other from Lahaina. 3 out of 4 adults in our party got a bit queasy. However, we did spot spinner dolphins (too many to count) on the trip out of Lahaina and they were so social and entertaining to watch!<a href="https://flic.kr/p/22ueXQn"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/4583/39044635481_ae14068a85_z.jpg" alt="Spinner dolphins" width="640" height="427" /></a></li>

If you made it this far, congrats! This probably should&#8217;ve been multiple posts, but I was too lazy to separate it; maybe some other time.		</p>

<h3>Last minute trip</h3>
<p>A few weeks ago, j.w found out that his company was sending him to Vegas. The initial plan was that we leave Bean with the grandparents for a few days while taking the baby with us. Except Vegas was 45C, feeling like 50C outside, and it isn&#8217;t exactly the most baby-friendly place. Plus, <a href="http://her.happyhippos.ca/2009/01/vegas/">I&#8217;ve been to Vegas before</a> and decided that being there once was enough.  So that left me with the option of staying home with the kids, in Toronto with the kids, or&#8230;I could pay an extra ticket and take all the kids with me to visit family in Vancouver; after all, Bean has been asking about when she could visit her cousin for months now &#8211; plus, I could help with kid-sitting since my mom&#8217;s sprained ankle wasn&#8217;t much better so she couldn&#8217;t take my sister&#8217;s kids. Turns out, my brother-in-law&#8217;s brother (does that make him brother-in-law too?) &#8211; who has no kids &#8211; was really awesome with the kids; they all loved him, and by the end of it, my crying boy loved him and Bean even chose him to drop us off at the airport &#8211;  over her aunt and grandma!  I could even leave him with 4 kids while I did dishes &#8211; made me think that maybe that&#8217;s what having an au pair feels like. We both concluded that <strong>two adults watching four kids is so much easier </strong>than one adult watching two, especially with the girls and boys being so close in age &#8211; the girls often went off giggling and up to no good, while the boys were okay in each others&#8217; company, even though they didn&#8217;t really play together much &#8211; other than around the train set. We also talked about how having more children at a home daycare is better because of this and you get paid more. Sleep was probably the biggest challenge, with him waking up at 5-6am the first few mornings, and having them sleep in on the two days that count: for church and the day of departure. Thankfully, with the two girls sleeping in one room, I didn&#8217;t really have to be with her although I felt bad that I often neglected her to try to put the youngest to sleep. My admiration for single parents have increased tenfold, especially if they don&#8217;t have any other family support around them to deal with sleep time, meals, meltdowns, and accidents. Trips out west generally feel really short even if it is longer than two weeks, but it seemed that 10 days was good enough this time &#8211; despite missed connections with old friends (we tried!); by the end, I felt I needed another vacation after this one.</p>
<h3>On the plane</h3>
<p>Speaking of departure, there&#8217;s nothing like hearing your name on the intercom at the airport along after the generic &#8220;final boarding call for flight xxxx  to Abbotsford; paging passengers L and W&#8221; that gets your legs going &#8211; while towing a preschooler in the car seat that&#8217;s strapped around the carry-on suitcase [ref]thanks to an idea from the internet &#8211; I saved $30 and used a non-weight tested luggage strap, carabiner and keychain ring, and the car seat tether instead &#8211; probably would be safer if I had used a weight-tested carabiner and O-ring instead [/ref] and carrying the baby in the ergo &#8211; and feeling sweaty by the time you settle into your seat on the plane. Thankfully, we were at the end of the second moving sidewalk already when I heard my name so it wasn&#8217;t too far for me to sprint there and wave, &#8220;we&#8217;re here &#8211; wait for me!&#8221;.<br />
I don&#8217;t know what happened to the time, but we left church late, met with some traffic on the road, and of course, everything just takes longer with kids; thankfully, I had no luggage to check-in (another great thing about having cousins close in age and size). But by the time we were through the family line in security, I looked at one of the screens and noticed that there was only 15 mins left until departure so instead of taking the friendly security officer&#8217;s advice to wait for a golf cart (I did go there to see if a cart was around). Actually, everyone was super kind at security and on my flight &#8211; they let me take the baby through in the ergo and didn&#8217;t even scan it, and perhaps I was last on board, but they offered to take my (heavy 25lb+) suitcase and ended up stowing it overhead up front (I told them I didn&#8217;t need anything in it, so I would also be okay if they decided to check it) and carrying my car seat into our row, while I took care of the kids and the backpack. As we were settling into our row, one of the flight attendants strongly suggested to the passenger in our row to move to another row &#8211; back 10 rows! She politely declined, saying that she was fine, but with some prompting from the flight attendant saying that it would give us some wiggle room and that she wouldn&#8217;t be sitting beside anyone, she finally agreed, and I thanked her with relief. Had I known that there were empty rows, I would&#8217;ve volunteered to go back, but I had asked if it was a full flight, and the answer I got was that there were only a few seats here and there. So we got a whole row to ourselves, with was great, as it allowed the kids to spread out and take turns in the car seat and the other seat.<br />

Unfortunately, Bean didn&#8217;t sleep at all (thus missing her nap) and little brother only got in a 30 minute nap at most both on the flight there and back. I do celebrate mini-successes though: on the first flight, I  did manage to transfer him into the car seat so that I could take her to the washroom. The second time she had to go, I picked a child-friendly show I had previously downloaded from Netflix on the iPad and gave him some snacks to munch on; alas, when I had to go the third time, he didn&#8217;t like it, so I took him with me. On the way back, he didn&#8217;t complain at all! Snacks (apple chips, <a href="https://broghies.com/whats-a-broghie/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">puffed rice crackers</a>, and baby food pouches, and the plane&#8217;s apple juice diluted with water) and new toys / activities (stickers, coloring, mini puzzles) kept them sane, but what worked on the 5 hr flight there didn&#8217;t work for the flight back &#8211; I only needed to take out 3 activities (1 for the boy) and the snacks for the short 3.5 hr flight back (wow, that&#8217;s some tail wind!), perhaps because the Dreamliner had the in-flight entertainment console (minus the sound &#8211; didn&#8217;t bother with earbuds), and the really cool shade button that adjusts the brightness and darkness of the passenger window pane. While we only got two seats to share among the three of us, it seemed more spacious than the Air Canada Rouge plane to Abbotsford &#8211; roomy enough for the boy to nap on my lap (again, for less than 30 minutes because he woke up upon transfer when Bean needed to use the lavatories) and for him to stand and sit on the floor in front of my seat.<br />

<h3>Highlights</h3>
<p>This trip felt very different because it was more about spending time with my sister&#8217;s family than seeing friends, trying new places, or going out. We did go out &#8211; often fitting the kids in 4 car seats in my sister&#8217;s Rondo + 2 adults in front, but it was to do kid-friendly activities, which were:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<figure style="width: 240px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a title="2017-07-29_01-30-24" href="https://www.flickr.com/gp/aimeili/M67LmW" data-flickr-embed="true"><img src="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4323/36068502752_7f7dff4a48_n.jpg" alt="Pushing a $30 cart at ikea" width="240" height="320" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Folks don&#8217;t seem to bat an eye when kids take the things on the showroom floor and use them for a bit&#8230;</figcaption></figure><br />
<script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script><strong>A visit to Ikea</strong> for play and lunch: this happens regularly in my sister&#8217;s family, but Bean was finally tall enough to play in the ball room so it was her first time; we took the boys to the unsupervised kids area in the showroom to play. At lunch, one of the staff pointed out the computer that was near the cash that lists all the ingredients in their food &#8211; the fish and chips were not safe (contains dairy), but the chicken fingers were safe so I got a kids meal instead with fries.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.coquitlam.ca/parks-recreation-and-culture/sport-and-recreation/dropins.aspx#Aquatics" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>$1 swim</strong> at the local community centre</a>: on Tuesdays and Thursdays, it&#8217;s only $1 a person, and the warm pool and communal change room is very large (with private changing stalls and showers in the latter) and you have a lot of accessories to use like life-jackets, floating boards, toys, and duck boats, plus you only need a quarter to lock up your stuff in the lockers AND you get your money back when you open it again. Don&#8217;t bring a water camera into the pool though, they don&#8217;t allow it. The littlest in our group ended up falling asleep on a duck boat when my sister took the two girls to shower.</li>
<li><strong>A meal at Red Robin</strong> meant you had unlimited sides &#8211; and they make the birthday girl stand up in her (high) chair when they sing their birthday song. I like independent restaurants but I have discovered that chain restaurants, like Red Robin, tend to be much better at providing ingredients / allergen information for each menu item. By the way, if you have the app, if you end up earning the 10th burger free on your visit, it will automatically trump any other promotion you may be offered, including 20% off your bill. Each kid also gets to take a balloon home where it is played with for days after.</li>

<script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script><strong>A day trip to ride the</strong> <strong>bus, Skytrain and Seabus</strong>: this in particular brings up memories of my aunt taking me to do this as a child; we didn&#8217;t use public transportation as a means to go somewhere, we just used it for the ride. The kids seemed to enjoy it as much as I did way back when. This time, I got to see and use the (finally done) Compass system for the first time, and going on a Saturday meant that everything was one-zone fare &#8211; and we managed to make all our connections before the time was up each way! There&#8217;s a small but free twirly slide into a pit of balls at Lonsdale Quay, but I forgot socks for my kids, so I took them to see the coin rides instead. I didn&#8217;t have money, but the $1 double decker London bus ride would&#8217;ve been the best value as it could&#8217;ve easily fit 4 kids in it &#8211; plus there&#8217;s a TV screen inside that acts like a window. Splurged on some local peaches and <a href="http://www.coconama.com/learn/nutrition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">coconama chocolate</a> because they had some nut and dairy-free versions (I&#8217;ve sampled some before but I can&#8217;t remember where &#8211; perhaps at the Handmade Show at the PNE). We were treated to some live music by a very talented young boy while we had our lunch, and I was surprised that my son ate an entire dynamite roll for lunch.</li>

<script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script><strong>A visit to Science World</strong>: they have added a relatively enclosed section [ref]with a staff member at the entrance monitoring who goes in/comes out &#8211; hoping to keep stray kids inside I think[/ref] dedicated for 0-5 year olds, which was amazing; they could have easily spent their entire day in this gallery &#8211; it had a climbing structure (no slide, but I&#8217;d recommend bringing socks), sensory play areas like water features, giant lite brite panel, kaleidoscope, balls, foam building blocks and plastic pipes, and a scoop-and-dump oatmeal-like area. The girls didn&#8217;t care for most of the shows, but we all enjoyed the bubble show on the main stage. The best part is that my sister found a <a href="https://www.scienceworld.ca/chinese-coupon-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2-for-1 admission promotion</a> posted on their site for those that can read Chinese. Odd, but we used it!</li>

Thankfully the kids didn&#8217;t really notice the long detour and traffic until closer to the end of our drive.</li>

Bought some <a href="http://jerkstore.ca/products/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">locally made beef jerky</a> at the pop-up market as it&#8217;s the first time I&#8217;ve seen jerky without any garlic or onions!</li>

On the other days, the kids were happy to play in the yard with bubble guns and on the make-shift slide that their uncle made; the water table made its first appearance outside, and was actually filled with water (that I had forgotten was gifted to Bean when she was born &#8211; but was then re-gifted because there was no way would we lug a table back). So thankful that the weather was really good during the time we were there &#8211; not too wet and neither too hot nor too cold!  Now, I&#8217;m looking forward to when my sister and her two come to us in September &#8211; she decided to brave the flights too! I am hoping it will still be warm enough to try water beads with them and sidewalk chalk fun then, and maybe even the mini parachute from Amazon Prime Day.		</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				When we go on family vacations, I often end up finding myself being our family&#8217;s &#8220;travel agent&#8221;, so here&#8217;s a handy list of what I consult when doing travel research or trying to get the best travel deal for my future reference, and for yours, if you end up being your family&#8217;s travel guy/guide:</p>
<h2>In general</h2>
<p>These are two places I check first for flights and accommodations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Google Flights &#8211; use them to get a sense of what the prices are, and where you might be able to find the lowest price if you&#8217;re more flexible with dates<br />
<figure id="attachment_5515" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5515" style="width: 294px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/flights.png"><img class="wp-image-5515 size-medium" src="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/flights-294x300.png" alt="Google Flights Flexible Date Chart to find the best price" width="294" height="300" srcset="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/flights-294x300.png 294w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/flights.png 699w" sizes="(max-width: 294px) 100vw, 294px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-5515" class="wp-caption-text">To find the price graph or chart, you need to click on the calendar icon in either date field.</figcaption></figure></li>
<li>AirBnb</li>
</ul>
<p>If you&#8217;re flexible on time and destination, you can find some pretty great flight deals on <a href="http://forums.redflagdeals.com/hot-deals-f9/?c=5159" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RedFlagDeals</a> or&nbsp;<a href="http://www.yyzdeals.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YYZ Deals</a>&nbsp;/ <a href="http://www.yvrdeals.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YVR Deals</a> (or other Canadian destinations via the parent company,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ydeals.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YDeals</a>)<br />
For ideas of what to do or eat, I like to sign out books from the library or borrow e-books from the library and jot down common suggestions or interesting ideas and go from there.</p>
<h2>Within Canada</h2>
<h3>Flights</h3>
<ul>
<li>Pick smaller airports if they&#8217;re similar in distance to your destination and price (e.g. Abbotsford over Vancouver, Kitchener-Waterloo vs. Toronto) as you&#8217;ll likely find cheaper parking, shorter check-in and security lines, and friendlier people</li>
<li>Cheaper seats tend to occur between Tuesday and Thursday</li>
<li>Check for the prices of flights&nbsp;operated by smaller brands like <a href="http://gonewleaf.ca" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NewLeaf </a>or <a href="http://flyporter.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Porter</a>, and even the sub-brands of major carriers like&nbsp;Air Canada Rouge or Air Canada Jazz. There are charters too like Air Transat or Sunwing, but I generally avoid them due to size and luggage restrictions.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Car Rentals</h3>
<ul>
<li>Costco Travel Canada, for Costco members; free second driver if spouse is also a Costco member</li>
<li>Priceline &#8211; I haven&#8217;t used them, but my parents have been able to rent a car near the Toronto airport for $10 a day by bidding on a car rental once upon a time.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Accommodations</h3>
<ul>
<li>I find there are less listings in Canada on Airbnb.com (likely because it started in SF, CA, so you might find more choices out West vs East), but one good alternative are bed &amp; breakfasts on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bbcanada.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bbcanada.com</a></li>
<li>If you&#8217;re travelling to a university town, you can always check their conference center or student residences if it&#8217;s during a quiet time of the year (e.g. summer) for private suites, student apartments, etc.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Canada to/from US</h2>
<h3>Flights</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fly from a US city instead of Canada, if it&#8217;s within driving distance; one night&#8217;s sleep and fly package at a hotel (where parking is included when you&#8217;re away) is cheaper than cost of difference in flight</li>
<li>Compared to Canada, there seems to be more&nbsp;competition and options in the US:&nbsp;while there are major US-international airlines&nbsp;(United, American Airlines, Delta), we actually prefer the service and price of domestic-only&nbsp;carriers like JetBlue or Southwest; we have not flown ultra-budget airline, Spirit yet, but seat-sale prices are good, even with the price of one checked baggage ($21 per person).</li>
<li>Honorable/historic mention: Hipmunk.com, once a SF startup, which provides a more comprehensive view of travel duration, prices on&nbsp;discount sites like Expedia, Travelocity, etc., but to be honest,&nbsp;I don&#8217;t consult it as much&nbsp;anymore now that Google Flight is an option.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Accommodations</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.airbnb.ca/c/ewong61" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Airbnb</a>&nbsp;(referral link &#8211; $40CAD for first booking)</li>
<li>Priceline &#8211; many people have booked via priceline, but if you&#8217;re travelling with more than 2, please note that the fine print says that the price is for two, so I&#8217;m not sure how it works if you plan to travel with more (do you pay the difference? I haven&#8217;t ever tried)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.vrbo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VRBO</a> and <a href="https://www.homeaway.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HomeAway</a>&nbsp;&#8211; so I&#8217;m still not clear about&nbsp;the difference between these two sites as they belong to the same company,&nbsp;and they seem to operate similarly to AirBnB but it seems less organized. My sister has booked with them before, for our places in Hawaii.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Car rental</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.autoslash.com/blog-and-tips/posts/all-about-additional-driver-fees" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Note that certain states cover a second driver for free</a>, and some car rental companies will have free second drivers if they&#8217;re your spouse or if you are a member, for example.</p>
<ul>
<li>Costco Travel may have different prices on the US site vs. the Canadian site &#8211; and you need to have separate logins as well; free second driver if spouse is also a Costco member</li>
<li><a href="http://autoslash.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Autoslash</a>: we came across this site from Parents magazine &#8211; if you can&#8217;t find a good deal on their site, if you book via another site (like Costco) and send them the confirmation number, it will look for cheaper options until your trip starts. If you end up booking through them, they will automatically cancel and book the same reservation for you if the price drops before your rental starts! I couldn&#8217;t figure out&nbsp;their revenue model so it seemed too good to be true at first, but it worked out great. We found out the hard way that some companies don&#8217;t include fees in the car rental quotes, but this site breaks everything down for you so it&#8217;s WYSIWYG (or pay in this case). You don&#8217;t actually pay until you get to the car rental counter! If you are looking for a specific service, eg. a shuttle to/from the cruise port, you might need to enter a specific location code, which can be found in the car rental fine print when you search for an itinerary OR you can email them to ask which location offers it (they do seem to know!)</li>
</ul>
<p>So, that&#8217;s what we have used in the past&nbsp;&#8211; if you have any links to add to the list / share, please leave a comment!		</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				This is the last entry in this series. The first two covered the highlights <a href="http://her.happyhippos.ca/2016/12/western-caribbean-before-and-after-the-cruise/">before and after the cruise</a> and <a href="http://her.happyhippos.ca/2016/12/western-caribbean-norwegian-getaway/">the cruise ship experience itself</a>. Finally, this &nbsp;one covers what we did on port days at Roatan, Harvest Caye, Costa Maya, and Cozumel.<br />
The itinerary and cost are usually the two most important factors when we&nbsp;select a ship to sail on, specifically the days at sea to port days ratio, and the destinations.&nbsp;We had originally selected a sailing that included a stop in Belize (City), but when I found out NCL&#8217;s brand new private island was opening a couple weeks&#8217; later,&nbsp;it seemed worthwhile to pay a little more to check it out. In the end, we still paid less because our cruise agent checked before our final&nbsp;payment, and the prices had gone down so she relayed the savings to us![ref]My mom recalls this happening before and since we were very happy with our previous cruise agent, who&nbsp;she&nbsp;has since retired, we just continued using someone from Expedia CruiseShip Centers&nbsp;anyway[/ref]. &nbsp;Ironically enough, after reading post after post that warned visitors about going beyond the port gates at Belize City and thinking Harvest Caye was definitely a safer and more developed alternative, we actually enjoyed Harvest Caye the least. We probably would have enjoyed the adventure in Belize City, as&nbsp;authenticity and culture was lacking at Harvest Caye.</p>
<h2>Roatan, Honduras</h2>
<p>This was our second-favourite stop.<br />
In Roatan, we booked a private tour in an AC passenger van with Victor Bodden tours, as we needed the flexibility with two young children who got hungry (and ate slowly) at regular mealtimes and napped in the afternoon. But, the original plan was to meet up with the lady from Familias Saludables to drop off a box of donated goods &#8211; since we were in the area, I had wanted to do something instead of just bask in cruise luxury. &nbsp;So, they were the perfect home for formula samples that I had and collected from&nbsp;freecycle, and since we missed Operation Christmas Child this year, it was nice to be able to pack a big box!). In my mind, I had thought that their organization was close to the port, so when I didn&#8217;t see the lady outside of the port gates, and their phone number wasn&#8217;t working, I was at a loss. Random tour operators hawking outside the gate would try to be helpful by calling the number, and asking me who I was looking for. Alarm bells went off when one of them, was like, &#8220;Oh! lady Valerie? Come here, I can show you&nbsp;to her building&#8221;. Yes, I admit, I started to follow him and left husband and daughter to wait but then politely thanked him when he pointed me to the building and turned around &#8211; because <em>stranger danger. </em>During this time, I find out that a member of the polizia tried to hawk a (pirated?) movie to j.w: &#8220;want a movie for five dollars?&#8221; Eventually, we went back inside the port and found the Victor Bodden kiosk.<br />
Thankfully, the lady knew my itinerary and called them to say that she couldn&#8217;t make it, but I think forgot to tell them where to find their building. Victor had told her that we&#8217;d find them, so after going to a few spots (one being the address listed on their website and definitely not the first building that guy pointed to), our guide and driver&nbsp;finally found them with success! Turns out, their contact information is wrong on the website. The assistant told me that Valerie had a patient emergency and while I wished I could have stayed to chat a bit, the kids were in the car, so off we went on our tour.</p>
<h3>Iguana</h3>
<p><figure id="attachment_5493" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5493" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img width="300" height="225" class="size-medium wp-image-5493" alt="iguana stew" src="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/iguana-300x225.jpg" srcset="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/iguana-300x225.jpg 300w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/iguana-768x576.jpg 768w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/iguana-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/iguana-1568x1176.jpg 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-5493" class="wp-caption-text">You&#8217;re looking at a part of the iguana in the iguana stew</figcaption></figure><br />
Truth be &nbsp;told, I didn&#8217;t expect an independent tour&nbsp;English-speaking guide to&nbsp;jump in with our driver, as she&nbsp;spoke Spanish only.&nbsp;Reviews online suggested that the driver was the guide, so I felt pressured to up our tip, since Victor had&nbsp;advised me to give the tip to the guide, Gina (which he relayed to the guide when she asked him), as all the day&#8217;s fees would go to the driver. It was her second tour ever, so I&#8217;m not sure if that&#8217;s why we didn&#8217;t go to as many spots that I read about. When I asked her why only some tour operators were allowed to sell inside the port vs outside the port, she explained that the ones inside have some sort of arrangement (or license?); I forget the exact reason. They took us to a overlook to&nbsp;see a picturesque view, but it looked like every tour was there, and so were the vendors. By then, because of our later start in the morning, it was lunch so we asked her for a local restaurant recommendation. She suggested iguana. Sadly, it wasn&#8217;t quite the local restaurant we were expecting &#8211; we ate under zip lines and by caged monkeys and birds, and all the patrons were tourists. Surprisingly, the iguana stew (stewed in what tasted like coconut oil , served with beans and rice with plantain) was one of the&nbsp;highlights of the trip, despite it being a stop for tourists; it tastes like a cross between chicken and fish (bones), which when I think about it makes sense &#8211; tougher than fish, but boney because it&#8217;s a reptile. Later, the guide told us that men just go into the bush to hunt for them, and sites online suggest that they&#8217;re endangered because of this. j.w&#8217;s Google timeline tells me that we were at Jungle Top Adventures Zipline for our iguana meal &#8211; it all makes sense now &#8211; that&#8217;s why I remembered her saying something about &#8220;Randy&#8217;s restaurant&#8221; because one of the owner goes by that name.</p>
<h3>Retail stops</h3>
<p>After that, we made a quick stop at the cameo factory, because I was curious to see what it was about as it&#8217;s a cruise ship excursion stop and on the tour&#8217;s recommended list. One guy was in his shop etching designs onto a shell; the rest of it was just a retail shop. And there was no active tour, but as we were leaving, a bus pulled in and I overheard them say, &#8220;sit down and the presentation will start shortly&#8221;. Seemed like a typical Turkish rug+coffee, Chinese tea or jade, or Korean ginseng excursion stop.<br />
We were then headed to a beach, but the kiddies fell asleep, so we opted to stop at the chocolate+coffee factory (Roatan Chocolate Factory) instead. Turns out, Roatan doesn&#8217;t have the best climate to grow coffee beans, so Honduras coffee is grown and roasted on the mainland. &nbsp;Again, there was no active tour or demonstrations, but I ended up buying a bag of coffee ($2 cheaper than at the port &#8211; we checked beforehand) and 5 bars of chocolate.</p>
<h3>Beach</h3>
<p><figure id="attachment_5500" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5500" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img width="300" height="169" class="wp-image-5500 size-medium" src="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/FHD0076-2-300x169.jpg" srcset="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/FHD0076-2-300x169.jpg 300w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/FHD0076-2-768x432.jpg 768w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/FHD0076-2-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/FHD0076-2-1568x882.jpg 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-5500" class="wp-caption-text">Local beach in Roatan</figcaption></figure><br />
For whatever reason, the driver and guide wanted us to stop at West Bay beach where it&#8217;s $10 per adult which includes a beach chair, wi-fi and use of restrooms. We much preferred a local (free) beach, but after some prompting we were going to head that way. Thankfully, there was some shade at the side of the road right across the street from the chocolate shop at the West End, and j.w asked, &#8220;what about here? is it okay to pull over and park here?&#8221; So, we set up our beach tent under some palm trees (note: it gets quite warm because of the greenhouse effect) and Bean and j.w spent some time playing in the very calm water with maybe one or two others around and no solicitors; it was lovely.&nbsp;<br />
We ended up back at the port an hour early, so we walked around and I took a chance and had a scoop of passion fruit gelato from a cart for $2US; it was refreshing. I&#8217;m kicking myself for not doing more research (I figured that&#8217;s what the guide is for) and asking for more photo stops, e.g. shipwreck or touch-and-go tour of the popular areas such as Sandy Bay, West Beach, Half Moon Bay, or at least tell me that&#8217;s where these are when we pass by them.</p>
<h2>Harvest Caye, Belize</h2>
<p>This was our least favourite stop.<br />

I spent some time talking about Harvest Caye <a href="http://her.happyhippos.ca/2016/12/western-caribbean-norwegian-getaway/">in my previous post</a>, and all we did was spend some time at the kids&#8217; splash pad area (despite knowing about recycled water) and used our $25 of our $50 free onboard credit to rent an open kayak to paddle around the lagoon. It was sunny and hot, and we actually managed to go around the lagoon in about 1/2 hour, with only j.w paddling (Bean sat in the middle, and I held the baby). Good thing we didn&#8217;t rent a $45 electric boat; although it had a canopy cover, we probably would&#8217;ve gone around in 10 minutes. Bean and j.w also went to play in the water on the beach, and I tried to take a seat on a beach chair, but I wasn&#8217;t thrilled with the number of wasp-bees around! No other place had that. We ended up going back on board to eat lunch as the restaurants there were not free.</p>
<h2>Costa Maya, Mexico</h2>
<p><figure id="attachment_5481" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5481" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img width="300" height="200" class="wp-image-5481 size-medium" src="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/tropicante-300x200.jpg" srcset="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/tropicante-300x200.jpg 300w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/tropicante-768x512.jpg 768w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/tropicante-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/tropicante-1568x1045.jpg 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-5481" class="wp-caption-text">Front row seats to the beach and water and solicitors at Tropicante</figcaption></figure><br />
Our favourite stop, which is telling because we got back on the ship with about 15 minutes to spare. Most of the day was spent relaxing under palm trees or in the water at beach in front of <a href="http://www.sandalsandskis.com/tropicante.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tropicante</a> at the Malecon in Mahahual &nbsp;&#8211; debated between this one or Blue Kay from reviews online. Anyway, Tropicante had the most excellent instructions on how to get there without falling into the trap of getting on a shuttle bus ($3 vs yellow cabs past the port gate for $2 per person). After stepping outside the port gates, it was very quiet in contrast, so you sort of wonder if you&#8217;re going to the right place. Thankfully, the yellow cabs were within a short walk, and they got you right to Tropicante. I was a bit hesitant about booking this place because of the taxi ride over and about not bringing the car seats, but even with one car seat, we didn&#8217;t belt our child in (gasp, I know!) and ended up holding them in our car ride over in a 16-passenger van (taller seat backs so I felt a little(?) bit better) but on our way back, it was just a Matrix. Steve, the owner, was right though &#8211; it&#8217;s slow, one-lane, short drive to and from the port. While not a good enough excuse, I&#8217;m thankful nothing devastating happened; thank God for his grace and protection!<br />
<figure id="attachment_5495" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5495" style="width: 225px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img width="225" height="300" class="size-medium wp-image-5495" alt="Tropicante" src="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/coconut-e1482388388957-225x300.jpg" srcset="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/coconut-e1482388388957-225x300.jpg 225w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/coconut-e1482388388957-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/coconut-e1482388388957-1568x2091.jpg 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-5495" class="wp-caption-text">Fresh coconut and guacamole</figcaption></figure><br />
We had reserved a few loungers under the shade, and while it was relatively quiet in the morning, more people came in the afternoon but not to the point where it felt crowded. The $6 guacamole was delicious without onions, and each $2 coconut was worth it (and cheapest around if you don&#8217;t count tip); for every order of coconut, they actually took a ladder to a tree and climbed it to chop down a coconut. Eventually, we discovered we could eat the flesh inside the coconut as well! mmmm. &nbsp;I think we ordered 3 or 4 coconuts, especially after Bean almost drank an entire one to herself. Service was excellent, although&nbsp;we seemed to have missed the owner; he introduced himself to those at tables, who also happened to be older (and caucasian). The ladies restroom was also very clean; I felt bad tracking sand and dirt on the floor! j.w and Bean spent time in the water; little guy and I spent some time there, but stuck around the loungers more. j.w ventured past the boundary to look for fish while snorkeling, on the advice of the staff &#8211; no wonder he mentioned something about hope he doesn&#8217;t die out there.<br />
We both tried a massage &#8211; j.w got a lady from the restaurant next door (didn&#8217;t realize they&#8217;re affiliated with restaurants until afterwards), and she told us it was $15 for half hour, and $25 for an hour. j.w didn&#8217;t tip figuring it all goes to her pocket, but when I went with Tropicante&#8217;s massage service, it was $20 for half an hour and $30 for an hour, plus an additional tip. It was nice to feel the open-air warm breeze, with sounds of the beach but the massage was a relaxation one, that was nothing in comparison to a RMT, plus it was a bit awkward to be face down with your top off.<br />
<figure id="attachment_5494" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5494" style="width: 225px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img width="225" height="300" class="size-medium wp-image-5494" alt="" src="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/4men-225x300.jpg" srcset="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/4men-225x300.jpg 225w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/4men-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/4men.jpg 1370w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-5494" class="wp-caption-text">at the Costa Maya port village</figcaption></figure><br />
The shops along the Malecon (strip between the shops and the beach) all seem the same after a while: restaurants and souvenir shops. And, it got really hot under the sun when we weren&#8217;t next to the ocean or under shade, so we only walked a little bit after our time at Tropicante. On the way back, in the port village, we stopped to watch a demonstration where 4 men climbed a tall pole and spun to come down. j.w climbed a fake Myan ruin tower and ended up getting a great view around him.</p>
<h2>Cozumel, Mexico</h2>
<p><img width="739" height="416" class="alignnone wp-image-5502 size-large" alt="Cozumel" src="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/cozumel-1024x576.jpg" srcset="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/cozumel-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/cozumel-300x169.jpg 300w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/cozumel-768x432.jpg 768w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/cozumel-1568x882.jpg 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 739px) 100vw, 739px" />Although we could&#8217;ve seen a Mayan ruin, I decided to use it as a walking around day, as the better ruins required you to take a ferry across and I didn&#8217;t know how the kids would be &#8211; flexibility was the key.<br />
<figure id="attachment_5497" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5497" style="width: 225px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img width="225" height="300" class="wp-image-5497 size-medium" alt="Starbucks" src="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/starbucks-e1482389021847-225x300.jpg" srcset="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/starbucks-e1482389021847-225x300.jpg 225w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/starbucks-e1482389021847-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/starbucks-e1482389021847-1568x2091.jpg 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-5497" class="wp-caption-text">A Chocolate Mexicano and what looks to be my name&#8230;</figcaption></figure><br />
We walked a long way to the local farmer&#8217;s market, but was disappointed to find that the restaurants in there only accepted pesos and there wasn&#8217;t much in terms of shopping other than produce and raw fish and meat. Eventually, we just found a random Mexican place to eat lunch, but it was close to $30 US for a platter (and mosquito bites) that we shared and a glass of horchada ($8?); at least it tasted homemade. Cozumel was also where we were told that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebozo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">rebozos</a> were sold in Mexico city and&nbsp;Yucatán, and not in these parts of Mexico. The best and most surprising find was the drinks at the Starbucks. WHO KNEW. I had avoided visits to chain restaurants, but we had gone in to look at the menu, and I had come across a Chocolate Mexicano. After conversion of 19 pesos to 1 American dollar, I ordered a tall, iced version; it was a delicious $3 spiced (but not spicy) chocolate drink that wasn&#8217;t too sweet even though I didn&#8217;t order it half sweet like most Starbucks drinks. &nbsp;So much so, that I came back for another cup &#8211; this time, I inquired about the price of a grande and venti, and after conversion, they came to the same price of $4! Yes, I got myself a venti. I debated between this and a mango passionfruit frappucino, but like the barista said, the frap is&nbsp;a sweet blended drink (ie. smoothie), so I don&#8217;t regret it, especially knowing that they didn&#8217;t sell the mix in a powder form (my mom inquired on my behalf when they went on the same cruise 2 weeks later). Actually, even the espresso based drinks come out to be cheaper than Canadian prices after conversion!<br />
We originally had planned to stop at MEGA, the supermarket that you could see from the ship because we often find unique food items at local grocery stores. But after encountering the places that only took pesos, j.w decided he didn&#8217;t want to walk there only to find out they didn&#8217;t take US or credit card. Turns out, this port and supermarket is the crew&#8217;s choice to get off the ship for snacks and chocolate and yes, they do take American dollars! Too bad.</p>
<hr />
And this brings us to the end of another family trip, and first cruise and birthday for the little guy, and the end of three months of having j.w off on parental leave with us. Already looking forward to the vacation days he has to take before the end of next month. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />		</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				Since this entry started getting really long, even for me to read, I&#8217;ve decided to break it up into parts. &nbsp;While <a href="http://her.happyhippos.ca/2016/12/western-caribbean-before-and-after-the-cruise/">the previous post</a> covered the time before and after the cruise, we focus on the cruise ship experience in this one, and the next one will cover what we did at the port stops.<br />
<figure id="attachment_5436" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5436" style="width: 739px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="wp-image-5436 size-large" src="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/NCL_Getaway-1024x767.jpg" width="739" height="554" srcset="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/NCL_Getaway-1024x767.jpg 1024w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/NCL_Getaway-300x225.jpg 300w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/NCL_Getaway-768x575.jpg 768w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/NCL_Getaway-1568x1174.jpg 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 739px) 100vw, 739px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-5436" class="wp-caption-text">Norwegian Getaway at Cozumel, MX</figcaption></figure><br />
Of the five or so cruises I&#8217;ve been on, this would probably be the first one where I didn&#8217;t feel any sea sickness; I did feel like I was still rocking on land at times, but no noticeable discomfort while at sea &#8211; hurray! Sadly, j.w had stomach discomfort&nbsp;for most of the cruise, but he ploughed through it, and still did stuff with the family regardless. Because we were travelling to areas that have reports of Zika, the cruise line offered DEET-based mosquito repellent at no charge at guest services, which was a nice gesture.<br />
One pet peeve: why are&nbsp;there misspellings everywhere on board? I realize that the majority of service employees on the ship may not have English as their first language, but Norwegian Cruise Line is a company with headquarters in Miami, so English should be its first language and typos just detract from a professional ethos. The&nbsp;marketing and brand correspondence should reflect positively on your&nbsp;company, including correspondence from companies that partner with you; &nbsp;that is, Park West Gallery, the art auction company on board can&#8217;t even spell <a href="https://www.ncl.com/ca/en/harvest-caye" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Harvest Caye</a> correctly in their marketing flyers to the ship&#8217;s guests&nbsp;[their version? &#8220;Harvest Cay&#8221;] &nbsp;&#8211; that&#8217;s the newest private island that NCL has branded and developed. Especially since we were only the second sailing to make a call there, you&#8217;d think NCL would want to make sure its name was spelled right. Speaking of which, we almost &#8220;bought&#8221; a &nbsp;piece of art at the art auction; somehow they &#8220;recorded&#8221; j.w not lowering his hand in time (with the rest of the room, as everyone started out with their hands raised) and a piece was thus &#8220;sold&#8221; to us; we didn&#8217;t know until they sent us a letter to our stateroom that we had not paid the invoice. Other examples include menu descriptions that are cut off (e.g &#8220;garlic toas[someotherdescription]t&#8221;) and sentences in the daily newsletter (e.g. &#8220;you hard desires&#8221; [&#8220;your heart desires&#8221;?]).</p>
<h2>Embarkation and disembarkation</h2>
<p>If we thought waiting to board the ship was a long time, disembarkation and customs took over 1.5 hours. Some even complained on Cruise Critic and Facebook that it took them 4 hours. This is why I could never book a flight leaving on the same day we arrive; it&#8217;d be too stressful.<br />
Embarkation took a lot time &#8211; we made it during our assigned chosen check-in time (actually, j.w and Bean did &#8211; the rest of us were assigned a later slot), but everyone was sitting in a waiting area in the terminal waiting to board the ship. By the time the first people were let through, people found out their staterooms weren&#8217;t ready yet so everyone mad rushed to get lunch &#8211; either at the buffet, Garden Cafe, or the sit down restaurants Taste / Savor.</p>
<h2>Cruise Critic</h2>
<p><figure id="attachment_5440" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5440" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="size-medium wp-image-5440" src="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/IMG_20161129_165603-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" srcset="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/IMG_20161129_165603-300x225.jpg 300w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/IMG_20161129_165603-768x576.jpg 768w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/IMG_20161129_165603-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/IMG_20161129_165603-1568x1176.jpg 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-5440" class="wp-caption-text">With compliments from the hotel director</figcaption></figure><br />
Speaking of Cruise Critic, try getting in on the <a href="http://www.cruisecritic.com/rollcalls/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">roll call</a> &#8211; because that&#8217;s where I discovered that they had an exclusive Cruise Critic meet and greet where you get to meet and chat with the officers / management, so that you get their information if you need to escalate any issues. j.w mentioned to the hotel director that our room had a bump below the carpet (felt like a snake of wires), and when we later went to the room, a complimentary chocolate trio plate&nbsp;from the hotel director was waiting for us. Turns out it was sent via his assistant; the director didn&#8217;t actually know what was wrong with the room but he apologized that he couldn&#8217;t do anything more for&nbsp;the ship was full. They also served some light refreshments with complimentary drinks, including smoothies, but I found them to be very sweet.<br />
Some on the &nbsp;Cruise Critic roll call organized a cabin crawl, which was great because we got to see a studio cabin and its exclusive lounge (the hotel director seemed to have just picked a random cabin) &#8211; the mood lighting almost reminds me of a spacey dorm room &nbsp;or a really spacious room on a plane &#8211; the toilet is literally a water closet; it looks like a space capsule and very claustrophobic. They have one-way windows that look out to&nbsp;the corridor, and you can opt to purchase a connecting cabin (and the $100 last minute prices for a studio cabin would make that very worthwhile). Other Cruise Critic guests offered their cabins for us to preview: a mini-suite is essentially a balcony cabin with a few more inches of room and a double sink, some of which have a tub shower instead of just a stand-up shower, and an accessible aft-balcony is almost 1.5x the size of a regular cabin, but I chatted with another guest at the meet and greet who was in a scooter and her accessible&nbsp;balcony cabin was likely two cabins in width!</p>
<h2>Food</h2>
<h3>Main Dining Room(s): Tropicana / Savor / Taste</h3>
<p><figure id="attachment_5437" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5437" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="wp-image-5437 size-medium" src="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/NCL_Dinning-300x216.jpg" width="300" height="216" srcset="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/NCL_Dinning-300x216.jpg 300w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/NCL_Dinning-768x554.jpg 768w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/NCL_Dinning-1024x738.jpg 1024w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/NCL_Dinning-1568x1130.jpg 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-5437" class="wp-caption-text">That&#8217;s because nobody spells &#8220;dining&#8221; like Norwegian</figcaption></figure><br />
Main Dining room food was mediocre at best. When you have a different dessert menu every night, but only one or two is repeated, and you find yourself ordering the same thing every night (i.e molten lava cake), then should have an idea just how ehhh&nbsp;the food is. I applaud them for allowing me to pre-order my meals ahead of time due to my allium intolerance as they prepped the dishes during the day, but that meant I was committed to eating at one of the main dining rooms the following night. However, ordering a plate of plain, grilled chicken breast or a steamed or broiled fish filet and a variety of steamed vegetables or even a plate of avocado, served to be quite the challenge &#8211; it seemed to boil down on who your server was and their pull in the kitchen (or whether they can inquire on your behalf) &#8211; this was very much unlike all the other cruise ships we had been on, and perhaps this is the huge drawback of freestyle dining; servers don&#8217;t remember your preferences and orders. I recall that the Maitre&#8217;D (Azim) and server on Celebrity went out of their way to ensure that Bean had &nbsp;a great meal when she was still a baby on a restricted diet. I&#8217;m not sure whether my diet restrictions affected the end results, but vegetable pad thai isn&#8217;t supposed to taste like lo mein saturated in soy sauce &#8211; whatever happened to the low sodium request or the tamarind (or ketchup at the minimum!), and although the beef tenderloin in the beef wellington was nice and tender, I was expected a puff pastry around the&nbsp;meat, but&nbsp;nope, it was just a piece of meat and veggies. I ordered a tonnado carpaccio-like veal appetizer, and out comes a roma tomato salad, but the worse part is that the server thought that it was a tonnado dish, which tells me that they don&#8217;t even know what the dishes are supposed to look like!<br />
We had made advance reservations, but we ended up doing walk-ins due to the (slow? lack of?) service at Taste; can we say it left a bad taste? (ha!). After trying all three, I think the dining experience is just the luck of the draw, based on which server you get. The atmosphere at Savour and Taste seemed similar, more casual but quiet, whereas Tropicana seemed more formal (dimmer lighting) but also louder with the nightly live-music entertainment on the dance floor, including some performances by Burn the Floor.</p>
<h3><strong>Garden Café</strong></h3>
<p>Maybe it&#8217;s because this ship is newer, but I really liked the added touch of washing basins / sinks at the entrances of the buffet; it&#8217;s easy to wash your and the kids&#8217; hands without having to visit the restrooms.<br />
A good variety of food was offered at the buffet, and made some attempts at some international food (I liked the Indian style curries more than the Chinese attempts, but possibly because I&#8217;m not Indian; the naan bread though seemed more like unleavened bread &#8211; the texture wasn&#8217;t quite there), and even offered a pot of self-serve chai tea (tasted like watered down evaporated milk with ginger tea than the spiced chai I usually encounter) at the buffet bar &#8211; it wasn&#8217;t with the rest of the beverages, so you had to have happened upon it, or someone told you. I really enjoyed the ox tail stew with plantains when we were at Harvest Caye for the day.<br />
There was a team of very enthusiastic staff at Garden Cafe, who would often greet guests with a song or two at the entrances with one guitar in hand, accompanied by backup singers. On one occasion, they even stopped to sing little brother the birthday song on his birthday; what a treat!</p>
<h3>O&#8217;Sheehan&#8217;s</h3>
<p>The host didn&#8217;t know of chicken and waffles on O&#8217;Sheehan&#8217;s complimentary pub &amp; grill (even though online descriptions mention it as a dining feature) and the breakfast I ate there was what I could get at the buffet &#8211; clever name though: Irish twist to &#8220;Ocean&#8217;s&#8221; which j.w &nbsp;had to point out before I got it, so we didn&#8217;t go back.</p>
<h3>Others</h3>
<p>Shanghai&#8217;s only opened for dinner, didn&#8217;t allow for reservations or carry away/take-out orders, the tall tables weren&#8217;t toddler / baby friendly, and it always seemed full, so we didn&#8217;t get a chance to try their Asian-style dishes either.&nbsp;If food and dining service was a hit and miss, why would I pay a&nbsp;premium to try their specialty restaurants; that is, paying more for potentially equally mediocre&nbsp;experience? I did toy with the idea of getting my espresso coffee fix at the café/gelato/sweets and pastry shop, but the&nbsp;18% service fee on&nbsp;a $2.95 cappuccino deterred me away.</p>
<h2>Entertainment and Play</h2>
<p>Norwegian Getaway is a relatively new big ship, at 2 years old. At Deck 7 and 8,&nbsp;you can take a selfie at a photo kiosk and send it to any email address for free, which is a neat way to say hi&nbsp;to&nbsp;people at home and a nice modern touch, since getting reliable wi-fi wasn&#8217;t the greatest unless you paid $7.95 for 15 minutes.<br />
Despite it holding 4000+ passengers and crew, the play areas never felt full &#8211; but for a ship that size, central areas like the pools and theatre seemed quite small. While we didn&#8217;t end up having the chance to go down any waterslide, the lines for them and for the other activities including the ropes course, bungee trampoline, spider mountain (a net where you climb to slide down a loop slide), mini golf didn&#8217;t seem very long at any given point. All of these seemed to be targeted for younger cruisers (like their competitors &#8211; maybe knowing that&#8217;s where the money is these days), with the exception of mini-golf, where I can see my parents doing; the rest I can&#8217;t.<br />
I didn&#8217;t think I would do the ropes course, but seeing that my fear-of-heights husband did it without&nbsp;much apprehension, I had to try it &#8211; plus, there&#8217;s a zip &#8220;line&#8221; at the end. The harness really makes it tame and very safe; it looks scarier to walk the 8ft plank than when you&#8217;re actually up there &#8211; I recall having some of these ropes on childhood play structures above the ground, and there were definitely no harnesses and people did get injured (though a friend tells me that she jumped and broke her leg, and not fall through the ropes). You do need closed toe and heel shoes (yes, even water shoes without socks), and a sleeved shirt &#8211; maybe so that the harness wouldn&#8217;t chaff against your shoulder?<br />
Sadly, the climbing wall was only open for limited hours (usually during nap time or dinner time), and I didn&#8217;t end up trying it either. They require&nbsp;socks and dry clothing, but provide climbing shoes and helmet for you at the rock climbing wall (so you might wish to bring and wear a bandana).<br />
Notes:&nbsp;the loop waterslide has a minimum rider weight of 99lbs &#8211; if you don&#8217;t meet that requirement and depending on what you wear, you might not make it around the loop and have to escape through the emergency hatch at the bottom of the loop; I didn&#8217;t even try to attempt. The sign for the bungee trampoline says that the maximum weight was 80lbs even though their marketing says it&#8217;s for kids and adults, so while I had wanted to try it, I didn&#8217;t. It wasn&#8217;t until after the cruise that when I searched online for photos of adults trying it (because what adult is 80lbs?! I may be close but still didn&#8217;t meet the requirement), that I saw people post photos of a previous cruise where they had a piece of paper taped over the 80lb correcting it to 160lb. That made more sense &#8211; as j.w said, I should&#8217;ve just asked them &#8211; though I didn&#8217;t want to embarrass myself in front of some kids so that&#8217;s probably why I held back anyway.&nbsp;<br />
I would also say that&nbsp;the private island, Harvest Caye, belongs under this category as I see it as an extension of NCL.&nbsp;Unlike the other ports, this island had a very artificial feel to it &#8211; with a &#8220;nature&#8221; center consisting of a few cages of&nbsp;animals, pristine sand, beach chairs crowding the beaches, a tiny lagoon for rented boats, stand up paddle board and kayaks, a pool with a swim-up bar, and potted plants. I felt bad for the lone staff manning a very empty ropes course &#8211; why would someone walk so far and pay for a ropes course when there&#8217;s a decently free one on board? The worst idea on that island though is probably recycling the water in the children&#8217;s splash pad / water park &#8211; we all know that some kids end up swallowing water when they play hard &#8211; especially down a waterslide, and other kids end up well, having accidents in the water when they play hard. You&#8217;d also think they would plan for having enough water on a hot day; the water level became too low for them to continue to operate the kid&#8217;s waterslide.</p>
<h3>Kid-friendly activities</h3>
<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-5438 alignright" src="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/NCL_JrRopes-225x300.jpg" alt="Junior Ropes Course" width="225" height="300" srcset="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/NCL_JrRopes-225x300.jpg 225w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/NCL_JrRopes-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/NCL_JrRopes-1568x2090.jpg 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" />Twisty slides and trampolines are two things that excite our little one, but she had to be 43 inches tall and while she had fun on the little rope course, she was definitely a&nbsp;bit scared even with the harness (and bit her lip when she slipped). I was a little disappointed at the Guppies room (0-3yo free play), as it hardly had enough room for two families to supervise and play, and they didn&#8217;t have a toy lending program unlike the Celebrity Millennium, but I appreciated the structured time they had set out for 0-2 year olds with their caregivers; we unfortunately missed most of them though as it conflicted with our lunch or dinner times. While they had a great program for&nbsp;children 3 years and older at Splash Academy, including a final theatrical performance by the kids, Bean didn&#8217;t take to it so well and refused to stay / go after the second day. She really enjoyed the soft foam splash pad area though, and it was enclosed, which was a nice touch to keep the kids (and water) in.</p>
<h3>Performances</h3>
<p>To be honest, I didn&#8217;t understand <em>Burn the Floor</em>&nbsp;feature performance (just looked like a mish-mash / showing off of all ballroom dance genres) and the music from <em>Million Dollar Quartet</em> wasn&#8217;t my cup of tea, so when our kids seemed more tired than usual, we weren&#8217;t too disappointed to miss it even though we had reservations. And because of kid bedtime routines starts around 8:30 PM, we usually had to call it a curfew after that time &#8211; so we didn&#8217;t see the complimentary comedy shows or other events in the evenings either.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Overall, it seemed less pretentious that Royal Caribbean&#8217;s <a href="http://her.happyhippos.ca/2013/03/eastern-caribbean/">Allure of the Seas grandioso&nbsp;experience</a>, maybe being less pretentious outweighs the other not-so-positives. When researching prior to the cruise, forum posters talked about NCL&#8217;s change of policies such as restricting any liquids to be brought on board, but according to some conversations I had with service staff, it seems like they also made changes&nbsp;for their staff: with vacation requests extending beyond&nbsp;2 months is more rare and evaluated according to&nbsp;seniority; it also seems the staff have less say in preference as to which ship to work on after each contract. Thus, more of their lives are spent on board than at home (often leaving family at home) and if they work well with a team or certain team members and are very familiar with one ship, they may have to relearn everything. Be warned that service staff may still be on shift / duty despite showing signs of a cold or a flu; I overheard the manager at the internet desk&nbsp;explaining that he was sick so he shouldn&#8217;t&nbsp;shake his co-worker&#8217;s hand. Sure enough, he was holding a wad of tissue and sadly, that was after I had already let my little one pound on the keys at the internet cafe. I made sure to wash his hands after, but maybe that&#8217;s where he caught the cold from, and didn&#8217;t get signs until the cool Miami evening breeze at the beach, thereby affecting everyone else in the family.&nbsp;</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				Following tradition, we booked a cruise vacation with just our family to end &nbsp;parental leave. This time, to the Western Caribbean. Personally, I much&nbsp;prefer the European cities (or seeing fjords!) but I figured the amount of walking and sightseeing would bore the little ones, so we decided on a Caribbean cruise, hoping that we would hit the start of dry season instead of encountering the end of hurricane / wet season. &nbsp;And since we&#8217;ve been to the Eastern Caribbean, j.w was okay to go on a Western Caribbean itinerary again (he&#8217;s been with his family). As it turned out, I ended up planning most of our vacation, including flights, car rentals, shore itineraries and accommodations, which was stressful and disappointing at times, but at least one of us knew what to expect. I didn&#8217;t think I w as a beach person, and if you had asked me to choose between relaxing at a beach and walking around a historic or coastal city, I would have definitely chosen&nbsp;the latter (I still might). In my mind, &nbsp;if you&#8217;ve seen one beach, you&#8217;ve seen them all. But just like how Italy converted me into a coffee drinker, it seems that this trip may have changed my perspective of island / tropical beaches. I still don&#8217;t like spending time in the water, but I&nbsp;would be happy sitting on a lounge chair under some palm trees soaking in the sunlight and ocean breeze. While I would have preferred to be able to read a book or magazine, entertaining a curious baby with sand was an okay alternative. I&#8217;m still not a museum person though &#8211; I will go but won&#8217;t spend hours reading every panel[ref]children and science museums tend to be an exception as they are more interactive, so maybe it&#8217;s more how they deliver the material[/ref] In the end, I&#8217;m glad we went with the beach climate &#8211; Bean loved the water and the beach, the island beaches were calm, in contrast with&nbsp;the crashing waves in Southern Florida so she got over her timidness quite quickly!</p>
<h2>Flights</h2>
<p>When I booked our flights, I didn&#8217;t realize that we were flying on American Thanksgiving[ref]in my excitement, I had failed to realize that the Thanksgiving Christmas parade was taking place as we were landing, so it was on our schedule but we ended up missing seeing a&nbsp;winter holiday parade in warm weather[/ref], and had I waited to buy our tickets, we probably would&#8217;ve saved even more as a result of holiday seat sales. But, our cruise agent had given me a Canadian quote of $300 one-way from Toronto, so when it was $150 one-way from Buffalo, I jumped on it. Other than no waiting at&nbsp;customs, I am thrilled to discover that there is now a Trader Joe&#8217;s en route from the Buffalo area. Driving back was no-fun though as the one-year old&nbsp;cried non-stop from there to the QEW, when he finally fell asleep and consequently lost his voice for a couple of days (resulting in whimper cries and hoarseness).<br />
Notes regarding flight carriers:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><img class="alignright" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3c/JetBlue_Airways_Logo.svg/585px-JetBlue_Airways_Logo.svg.png" alt="jetBlue logo" width="161" height="54"/>JetBlue</strong> reminds of WestJet, but with free wi-fi&nbsp;on board and really good snacks (blue potato terra chips); $20US for the first piece of check-in luggage but no weight limit for carry-on items!</li>
<li><strong><img class="alignright" src="https://wieck-swa-production.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/372f5abb7c68f0bca406f561e53098d8484774ed/preview-768x432.jpg" alt="Southwest logo" width="259" height="39"/>Southwest</strong> is great when you have family, as you board after the A group, before the B group &#8211; we would&#8217;ve been B15 even though I checked in right at the 24 hour mark, so you get to choose your own seats first and each seat is entitled to two complimentary check-in luggage&nbsp;(leaving us with a ton of free hands because we didn&#8217;t have to take as many carry-on luggage!); they have free TV that you can stream on your mobile device but no free wifi. Their snacks are also pretty decent (<a href="http://www.belvitabreakfast.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">belvita breakfast crackers</a>), but if you have a peanut allergy, you probably shouldn&#8217;t fly with them as they distribute peanuts.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Miami and its surrounding area</h2>
<p>We&#8217;ve discovered that living in beach-friendly Florida isn&#8217;t cheap &#8211; accommodations, eating out and groceries are expensive! I intentionally chose accommodations near the beach so we could walk there (no need to pay for beach parking), and but even fresh fruit and vegetables and seafood wasn&#8217;t cheap; cheaper than dining out, but I was surprised how much cheaper we get our groceries at home. It is also the last time I order something without inquiring how much it is: a slice of key-lime pie at Big Pink was a whopping $10USD ($13 CAD); thankfully, it was delicious and not neon green[ref]I had wanted to try key-lime pie, since that&#8217;s one of Miami&#8217;s fame, in addition to stone crab and cuban sandwiches &nbsp;&#8211; we got 1lb of cooked stone crab claws at Publix in Hollywood, probably saving at least $10 US+tip but they&#8217;re impossible to crack with teeth but found out that if you manage to break apart the claws, then you can push the sweet, juicy meat upwards and out[/ref]. I surprised myself that without any spices available for us to use, we were still able to make a pretty flavourful cream-sauce pasta with supermarket new england clam chowder, some brussels sprouts, accompanied with stone crab. US should really have Spanish as the official bilingual language; it was everywhere! In hindsight, I&#8217;m glad we didn&#8217;t end up staying in Little Havana (that was briefly considered when I was looking for places on airbnb) because <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/11/26/tears-havana-cheers-miami-news-fidel-castros-death-divides-nation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the party went to the streets</a>&nbsp;in the middle of the night when news broke that Castro had died.<br />
<img class="size-medium wp-image-5424 alignleft" src="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/20161125_104241-300x169.jpg" alt="Trains at Aventura Mall" width="300" height="169" srcset="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/20161125_104241-300x169.jpg 300w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/20161125_104241-768x432.jpg 768w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/20161125_104241-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/20161125_104241-1568x882.jpg 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />j.w humoured me and we went Black Friday shopping, just not at 6am. We weren&#8217;t specifically looking for anything, so we didn&#8217;t need to fight with the crowd. Actually, finding parking was a breeze at 10AM, compared to when we left early afternoon &#8211; cars followed you when you exited the mall doors.&nbsp;Turns out that if you go shopping (at Aventura Mall, not sure if elsewhere) before noon on Black Friday, some stores have exclusive discounts, like an extra 20% off at the Disney Store. We ended up buying 6 pairs of toddler socks for $7&nbsp;at Sears (for the toddler, baby, and myself to use since there was a free soft play area that the kids wanted to play in and the candy store sold one pair of sock for $3 behind the counter), and a $50 shopping spree at the GAP because j.w somehow managed to win a gift card at the Samsung booth after taking a 360 photo &#8211; just because he had a Samsung phone, hurray! That mall also had a really great train set going and an indoor koi pool pond so that non-shoppers had other options too.</p>
<h2>Unexpected surprises</h2>
<p>In addition to the $50 surprise from Samsung, we definitely encountered our share of mishaps / unexpected costs on our vacation &#8211; to the point where I thought that maybe it was a sign that we shouldn&#8217;t have gone:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bean fell down the stairs and bruised and cut her lip and nose a couple of days before &#8211; thankfully nothing was broken</li>
<li>j.w lost his wallet (third time within a few weeks) a few days before we left; this time it contained his newly received IDs, our US credit card and $400 USD. We still don&#8217;t know where it went. Thankfully, he had a temporary paper driver&#8217;s license that was still valid and a couple of Canadian credit cards &nbsp;&#8211; though the rental agencies didn&#8217;t even check for the expiry date on his old one</li>
<li>in my rush to get ready for bible study the morning we were to leave, I had used my wallet to pay for our check-in luggage and forgotten to take it with me. So, no IDs, no health cards, and no credit cards. Thankfully, the second bath of USD was in a separate envelope in my purse and not in my wallet! Guess I wasn&#8217;t going to drive.</li>
<li>When we checked out of our hotel in Buffalo, they told me that the credit card on file was declined! I had prepaid on the Expedia family and friends site, but the hotel had to charge me again. Turns out, Expedia uses their company credit card to handle bookings, so I had to take the time to call and complain while on vacation &#8211; and Expedia made the hotel refund the charges, despite it being <em>cheaper</em> than Expedia&#8217;s rates (I suspect it was the 7-day vs. 30-day sleep and fly package). The hotel (Days Hotel) told me later, that they would match any other deal so I just need to call them and ask next time. Also, do&nbsp;<em>not&nbsp;</em>use a + in your email address on Expedia&#8217;s friends and family site to book your reservation (eg. youremailaddress+travel@gmail.com) because while it will create an itinerary, you will never get a confirmation email and customer support will have no&nbsp;idea why their emails aren&#8217;t getting through to you. I suspect that the &#8220;+&#8221; is a &#8220;bad&#8221; character and does crazy things to their script / code.</li>
<li>At our first car rental (also booked through Expedia, but with our cruise agent from Expedia CruiseShip Centers), we were surprised to see a $32USD extra charge on top of the prepaid amount. Had I known, I wouldn&#8217;t have rented from them. She told us that regardless of who you book with, charges will be added. Yes and no &#8211; we booked our second rental with <a href="http://autoslash.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">autoslash.com</a> and the fees were included in the breakdown of expected costs, so there were no unpleasant&nbsp;surprises (just pleasant ones &#8211; like them automatically rebooking the same reservation at a lower price, or Alamo giving us a free upgrade to a SUV which was much roomier than a standard-sized car and then calling us after our rental to ask how our experience with them was &#8211; talk about good customer service!). *<strong>Update:</strong>&nbsp;Wow, Expedia &#8211; I&#8217;m impressed. Our cruise agent followed up after hearing about our issue and comp&#8217;ed&nbsp;the extra charges. I didn&#8217;t expect the latter, but I&#8217;m thankful that our cruise agent took the time to hear what happened and how it could&#8217;ve gone better. I hope that future customers will be aware of these extra charges, and ideally will find out what they are specific to that location prior&nbsp;to their trip.</li>
<li>Way too many places are closed for American Thanksgiving &#8211; finding a place to eat dinner that night was an interesting challenge</li>
<li>When we got back to Buffalo, after waiting for a while in the hotel shuttle area instead of the off-site parking shuttle area for our ride back to the hotel parking lot, we discovered to our dismay that our car battery had died and needed a jump-start, so our hunger needed to wait. Thankfully, I had snacks for the toddler and she held up! We ended up eating a light lunch followed by a light dinner (back-to-back) but on the way back, our littlest one cried all the way from Trader Joe&#8217;s to the QEW before finally falling asleep. As a result, he lost his voice and his cries the following days sounded like a weak whimper with hoarse chattering.</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, though, it was a good time away as a family, without needing to worry about cleaning the house, making food (except when we wanted to), doing laundry, or running errands. According to Fitbit, our vacation was indeed a time of rest; the average sleep went up just shy of 7 hours for the week, from about 6 hours or less before and after.<br />
Since this entry started getting really long, even for me to read, I&#8217;ve decided to break it up into a few&nbsp;parts. The next two posts will cover the rest of the cruise and port experiences.		</p>
