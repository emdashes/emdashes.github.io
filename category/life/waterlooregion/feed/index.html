				Three things I&#8217;ve learned today: <ul><li>Black is in. If you are invited to a (non-Asian, millennial) evening wedding and reception, it is perfectly okay (and hip) to wear a black dress. Even the bridesmaid was wearing a black dress; black is the new red.</li><li>European-style roasted pig is different than the Chinese BBQ suckling pig way &#8211; the European way is more like roasted stuffed pig that you can carve which taste like chorizo; the skin is still nice and crispy though!</li><li>KW is really <i><strong>that</strong></i> small. We don&#8217;t really know the bride that much so it was a real surprise to discover that we go to the same church as her parents. Our new aunt and uncle-in-laws are in our church family! Why this is crazy?</li><li>My cousin&#8217;s family are not regular church-goers and they don&#8217;t live here.</li><li>We have only been going to this church for approximately a year, in a different neighbourhood than where the bride&#8217;s family lives.</li><li>Of all the churches here (there is at least one in every neighbourhood, if not more), we ended up at the same church as their family &#8211; and only found out at the wedding. (this point is especially meaningful because feeling like I belong is important to me, and God knew all this time &#8211; a good topic for a future reflective post)</li><li>On top of that, j.w has been playing pickleball with the bride&#8217;s father for the past few months without realizing the connection.</li><li>I had known that the bride&#8217;s family was &#8220;Mennonite from Ayr&#8221;; I did not connect &#8220;Mennonite Bretheren&#8221;with &#8220;Mennonite&#8221;. Upon finding this out, my aunt asked me if we were Mennonite, and I said no, we&#8217;re not Mennonite &#8211; it was really hard to explain, but I guess she might have understood it better if I made the comparison of going to a Catholic church without actually being Catholic, or a Chinese church without being Chinese.</li></ul>I had expected going to the wedding knowing only my cousins and the family, but it turned out, we knew a table of other guests and had a connection to both sides of the family; what a delight and such a joy to celebrate with and to get to know both sides a bit better! Only God could&#8217;ve made this possible, and He&#8217;s not done&#8230; <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="ðŸ™‚" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> 		]]></content:encoded>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				The last government under Kathleen Wynne had promised free childcare for preschoolers (2.5-Kindergarten) beginning 2020, so I didn&#8217;t pay much attention to it. What I didn&#8217;t know was that <a href="https://news.ontario.ca/opo/en/2018/03/more-child-care-more-choice.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the government also gave extra funding to daycare centres</a>, so that parents end up saving a few dollars a day! So lesson is, do your research when comparing home daycare and daycare centres. I&#8217;m sad that they didn&#8217;t extend it to licensed home childcare providers, since the region keeps trying to recruit people to either open up a licensed home daycare <em>or</em> send their children into licensed home daycare.</p>
<hr />
When we were looking for child care late last year, we signed up for the region&#8217;s &#8220;OneList&#8221; &#8211; which is essentially a one-stop shop for licensed childcare options. At the time, I had place my child&#8217;s name into home child-care providers in addition to a waitlist of daycare centres close by. Well, 6 months later, a few spots opened up in the daycare centres and initially, it seemed like the cost was between $10-15 more a day to have a child in a daycare centre. When we visited one, I felt like it was pretty chaotic (and overwhelming), with 1 adult to 8 kids in a pretty tight space. I had pretty much written off that option until a recent visit to another daycare centre changed my mind because:</p>
<ol>
<li>Even though they both belonged to the same organization, the space felt so much more open, with a big room and high ceilings and a shaded outdoor natural area for play. And, because this daycare centre isn&#8217;t attached to a school, you don&#8217;t get school aged kids going, which makes it seem less crazy, maybe?</li>
<li>This daycare centre doesn&#8217;t bill for stat holidays, Christmas week, and you get an additional two weeks unbilled. Home daycares bill year round, unless the caregiver cannot provide care for that day.</li>
<li>With the bonus unbilled days and the extra funding from the government that brought daycare costs down by a couple of dollars a day, it seems like it&#8217;s cheaper to send my child to one day of daycare than to keep him in home childcare full-time! (numbers below are approximate)</li>

</table>
<p>While the cost differential isn&#8217;t very significant per year for us (though every dollar might count for a family with a tighter budget), we made the switch part-time as we felt our child might benefit from going to a more &#8220;school-like&#8221; program (closer to the kindergarten learning model) since he&#8217;ll be going to school (far too) soon. However, I&#8217;m not ready to give up <a href="https://www.sapcrc.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the PCRC</a> and our caregiver yet, so hopefully this will work out.		</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				I&#8217;m at the age where I&#8217;m comfortable with shopping and ordering online. And while I prefer to text and instant message people over chatting on the phone, I felt uneasy texting an unknown Toronto number to order a box of brownies for local delivery; so, my age is beginning to show, perhaps?<br />
The other day, I came across an ad on Facebook: the premise is that you text a number to order some treats (brownies in this case), and they deliver to your door. The conversation started on Facebook Messenger and then transitioned over to SMS, where I was able to order a box of dairy-and-nut-free, reduced-sugar brownies. Sure enough, that evening, a box of brownies showed up at the door, with a real person &#8211; the baker &#8211; behind it.<br />
My first SMS order was a success! And while I feel like this way might be more personal and a cheaper than ordering through an e-commerce site, traditional credibility (ethos) goes out the window, which impacts the professional image. It didn&#8217;t help that they wanted me to give an online review on a Facebook group in exchange for free delivery, and when they told me they took square (for credit card payments), I expected to pay with a credit card, but on delivery, he told me he didn&#8217;t bring it because everyone paid with cash (square charges a fee). I also took measures to use a throwaway SMS number as I didn&#8217;t want a business to have my personal mobile number for other marketing purposes.</p>

But I probably would order from <a href="https://www.facebook.com/bakehurry/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bake-Hurry</a> again &#8211; especially if they had a promo since dairy-free and nut-free baked treats are hard to come by! When local hipster cafes and bakeries start charging an upwards of $4 for a square brownie, a box of 24 decently sized pieces of freshly baked custom brownies for $30 (or $20 for first time customers) becomes a great price and I like being able to support our local small businesses. The way they are boxed makes them look homemade, but they do come from a rented commercial kitchen (Courtyard Kitchens), in the same building as <a href="https://www.fourall.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Four All Ice Cream</a> in Kitchener. I should have frozen some had I done some pricing research since they should last up to a month in the freezer or a week in the fridge. They do have a nice chocolately crunch on the outside with a soft chew on the inside, just as advertised, and just the way I like my freshly baked cookies. I&#8217;m glad I asked for reduced sugar because I found it sufficiently sweet &#8211; the regular version would probably have been too sweet for me. A friend commented on the texture, that it reminded her of mooncake, but perhaps that is because it is the dairy-free version?<br />
Same day (from order to) delivery is another win in my books, as it&#8217;s perfect for those cravings (for dessert, a sweet bite, or those midnight munchies &#8211; like right now) and last minute meal prep and I don&#8217;t have to go out to get them, especially if I don&#8217;t want to lug my kids around with me.		</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				Taken from the archives of my UX blog, started some years ago. Originally posted: October 22, 2010Â | Revisited today, as we&#8217;re usingÂ mobile more than ever before.<br />
<a href="http://www.uxwaterloo.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">uxWaterloo</a> is a local group that meets regularly with folks interested in the user experience of products and services. This month, James Wu, a UI Architect, spoke at the meeting about design considerations for mobile experiences.Â This event particularly interested me, not only because of the topic, but particularly also because the guest speaker is from Kobo, a CanadianÂ (at the time) e-book company (that integrates with Pocket, so you can download and read everything you&#8217;ve saved online offline and without the ads!).<br />
Like many, I have traditionally focused more on web desktop experiences, but I have on occasion needed to design for a mobile experience as well. James eloquently summed up the challenges I have often come across when transitioning to the mobile space, and reminded me of others that aren&#8217;t always thought of, such as:</p>
<h2>Screen Real Estate</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Screen size</strong> (diagonal space)<br />
For example, a 29&#8243; desktop monitor could be 300-500% bigger than a mobile phone</li>
<li><strong>Orientation</strong> &#8211; the changes from portrait and landscape (and vice versa)<br />
What&#8217;s interesting is that during their user research with 1024&#215;600 tablets (such as the Samsung tablet), they observed that users prefered using this size of tablets in landscape format</li>
<li><strong>Screen resolution</strong><br />
Using the same 1024&#215;600 example, you would either have your screen in &#8220;short and wide&#8221; format, or &#8220;narrow and long&#8221;</li>
<li><strong>On screen keyboard</strong><br />
On many touch devices, more than 1/2 the screen is taken up by the keyboard, which would cover anything underneath it</li>
<li><strong>Platform variations</strong>Â (orÂ device / hardware variations)<br />
The takeaway? Design for different experiences/products; don&#8217;t cram everything into one screen if it&#8217;s not necessary. Why? &#8220;Don&#8217;t necessarily think people use their phones the same way as tablets [desktops, etc.].&#8221; James said that at Kobo, they must design knowing that people will have multiple devices; the experience should be consistent across them, but not [necessarily] identical.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Hardware</h2>
<p>Like desktop computers, hardware varies across different models. For the mobile devices, things like processor and memory are important to consider as it could affect battery life, performance, and even result in side effects like heat. Others include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Removable storage:</strong> the ability to &#8220;hot swap&#8221; a media card while the application is running in either the background or the foreground could cause undesired effects if designed improperly</li>
<li><strong>Interaction mechanisms:</strong> these may effect how a user interacts with an application such as trackballs, trackpads, keyboards, gesture strips (like the Palm Pre)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Gestures</strong><br />
For touch devices, we get into the a realm that is still pretty new. There is not yet official standards for touch gestures and there is limited documentation to illustrate them (James suggested that Apple may currently have the leading edge).</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Core/standard gestures</strong> like tap, swipe, pinch, expand, drag<br />
For example, a more common gesture is the Pinch-Zoom to adjust the font size of Apple devices</li>
<li><strong>Peripheral gestures</strong> may include less familiar gestures such as long press, rotate, shake, sequences<br />
Using Apple again for this example, a less common might be shaking the iPhone to perform the undo action</li>
</ul>
<p>When designing for touch, one must consider gestures could be used in different directions and even with multiple fingers. It isn&#8217;t surprising that some devices even recognize simultaneous touches (imagine designing a piano keyboard app so that multiple keys could be played at once to create a chord).<br />
It&#8217;s also important to provide users with affordances that let them know that features are there, and that they will use. Kobo uses instructional overlays for first-time use, as well as ghosted elements. I tried to imagine what a &#8220;ghosted element&#8221; was based on James&#8217; description and thought of the many mobileÂ gamesÂ where they use these visual cuesÂ to indicate the controls (where to tap on the screen) as a part of the onboarding experience.<br />
Kobo may also add advanced gestures for more advanced users (like a keyboard shortcut on the desktop), such as adding an element of fun by adding a gestural easter egg in the Kobo app.</p>
<h2>User Context</h2>
<p>We must remember that users are likely in different environments and may have more constraints than if they&#8217;re sitting in front of a desktop. Considerations include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Mobility:</strong> device may not be plugged in (may impact battery life for example)</li>
<li><strong>Divided attention:</strong> users could be multi-tasking or looking at the device on the go<br />
[e.g. using their devices while walking from the train platform to catch the connecting train]</li>
<li><strong>Unpredictable surroundings:</strong> things like flakey connections [e.g. online then loses reception while train goes under the tunnel] could impact a download or chat experience</li>
<li><strong>Cost:</strong> How much would it cost by running your application? Unfortunately, not everyone has unlimited data. Some customers pay per byte, and that might mean customizing for wifi vs. data</li>
<li><strong>Others:</strong> the amount of light (dark environment) or even the number of free hands could impact how they interact with the device.</li>
</ul>
<p>I&#8217;ve observed commuters carrying a briefcase in one hand, newspapers in another, and managed to hold a cup a coffee, along with their device. In that case, could they still perform a multi-touch gesture, and would they still be able to navigate even if they couldn&#8217;t?<br />
Knowing what users are doing while they&#8217;re using your product is a good advantage. Lesson from Kobo: James told us of a time when they hid the notification bar, including the time, to minimize distractions while the user was reading. Yet, it didn&#8217;t occur to them that if a customer didn&#8217;t have a watch or an easy way to check for time, they had to exit out of the application. Now, the notification bar can be brought back with a gesture.</p>
<h2>Standards and Expectations</h2>
<p>Customers might expect applications to be specific to their product. When Kobo designed an app that looked like it was for Apple device, Android customers weren&#8217;t happy. But once they took away the &#8220;Apple&#8221; button and changed the color, they noticed a decrease in complaints about the look of their application.<br />
So when designing for a mobile experience&#8230;<br />
&#8230;these are just some considerations and potential challenges that may come up while designing for a mobile product. Others are shared across the desktop too. We can&#8217;t forget who we&#8217;re designing for, the primary user for your product. For Kobo [at the time], it&#8217;s for women in the mid 30-40s, simply because they found that they spent the most money. Who knows, you might even need to take accessibility concerns as a requirement, simply because it&#8217;s the law.		</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				The local libraries here aren&#8217;t your typical traditional ones; sure you can borrow books, but they offer so much more. In addition to having resources like a media centre with a 3D printer and VR games, library patrons can borrow video games, toys, museum passes, and even internet hotspots; they also offer some really interesting programs for different age groups. I&#8217;m no stranger to circle time with wee ones, crafting terrariums, breaking out from a mini-escape-room,Â <a href="http://her.happyhippos.ca/2015/05/coffee-notes/">learning about </a>coffee, or watching new DVD releases in the library&#8217;s littleÂ theatre; everything is at and hosted by the library, and the best part is that they are all free! I sometimes wish I had more time or the waitlist to some of these weren&#8217;t so long (like the upcoming social paint nite and refreshments) [ref] this one filled upÂ within 10 mins of open-registration[/ref])!<br />
<span style="font-size: 16px;"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-5592" src="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_20170123_194337-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="739" height="554" srcset="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_20170123_194337-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_20170123_194337-300x225.jpg 300w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_20170123_194337-768x576.jpg 768w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_20170123_194337.jpg 1447w" sizes="(max-width: 739px) 100vw, 739px" />The other night, Ryan Horne from </span><a style="font-size: 16px;" href="https://www.facebook.com/foragergreens/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@ForagerGreens</a><span style="font-size: 16px;">Â graciously gave a workshop at the library on how to make kombucha, offeredÂ samples of some of his kombucha, and brought everyone a containerÂ of starter brew + SCOBYÂ (ready to be added to freshly brewed sweet tea). At the workshop, we found thatÂ he sells the starter kit for $20, so we just saved ourselves $20 &#8211; though it&#8217;s really the SCOBY that we&#8217;re after, as everything else we can easily source! Like </span><a style="font-size: 16px;" href="http://her.happyhippos.ca/2014/01/kefir-and-breast-milk/">the kefir</a><span style="font-size: 16px;">Â that j.w now makes and drinks (whereby Bean happily drinks plain and gulps down the whey as if it was juice), all one needs is the active ingredient (Kefir &#8211; grains; Kombucha &#8211; SCOBY), and you&#8217;re good to go for awhile.</span><br />
I don&#8217;t know how my first batch will turn out; it&#8217;s sitting on another counter away from the kefir. If it&#8217;s doing what it&#8217;s supposed to be doing, the tea <del>will turn</del>Â is turning lighter, almost to a golden hue, as the week progresses, and a new layer of SCOBY <del>will be formed</del>Â is forming on top. Unlike kefir where you see a distinct separation of the &#8220;curds&#8221; and whey, there seems to beÂ no obvious visual indicator, other than the color and that the SCOBY has formed a layer across / seal &#8211; and only if you&#8217;re paying attention. However,Â theÂ final indication of both is the taste-test; if you like it, it&#8217;s ready.<br />
Before my notes get all wrinkled and smudged, here&#8217;s what to know about kombucha:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kombucha" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">kombucha</a>, Japanese in origin to mean &#8220;kelp tea&#8221; [ref]makes sense to me, since the stringy yeast on the SCOBY reminds me of kelp / seaweed at times[/ref], now it means fermented (sweet) tea. If you buy a commercial bottle in stores, you could spend anywhere from 3$ to 6$! Essentially, it&#8217;s made up of starter brew+SCOBY+brewed sweet tea.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Starter Brew</h2>
<p>Fully brewed kombucha should smell like vinegar (or a faint smell if it&#8217;s not too strong), and a formula for starter brew comprises of: 1-2 cups of full brewed kombucha (the starter liquid) + SCOBY that is at least 1/8 inch thick (5oz) and should cover at least 1/2 of the surface area / opening of the jar/container/vessel, which is added toÂ 1 gallon brewed tea; the more SCOBY you have, the more likely you will succeed. If you don&#8217;t have starter liquid, you can substitute it for a 1/4 cup of distilled vinegar.</p>
<h2>SCOBY</h2>
<p>What&#8217;s a SCOBY? It stands for Symbiotic Culture of Bacteria and Yeast.</p>
<ul>
<li>A healthy one can look like a thin puck andÂ it&#8217;s not unusual to see spits, holes, strands, floaties and strings of yeast[ref]edible, but most people filter it out[/ref]. When you pick it up, it should stay together and shouldn&#8217;t tear easily. A new SCOBY is beige, creamy in colour; the underside will likely look more weird than the top side, and colours of blue or purple aren&#8217;t unusual; it might sink, and that&#8217;s okay. If your container is too small for the SCOBY, it is safe to cut it up.</li>
<li>An older SCOBY can turn brown, work slower or stop working, but you can just keep it there in the batch. However, if you see mold on it, just scrap it and start new. Â  Signs of mold include powdery, dry splotches, specks in black, blue, or white; people have compared it to mold on an orange or a piece of bread.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Brew Environment and Equipment</h2>
<ul>
<li>Making an ideal brew: it thrives in 73-85F temperature, out of direct sunlight and avoid an exterior wall if possible. Don&#8217;t fill the container too full: leave some breathing space at the top of the container forÂ the ecosystem to work; it also needs a &#8220;lid&#8221; that breathes such as a paper coffee filter, dish towel, or a piece of paper towel.</li>
<li>Food-grade plastic, glass, or stainless steel is okay, despite what online research mayÂ say</li>
</ul>
<h2>Brewing SweetÂ Tea</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<h3>Water</h3>
<ul>
<li>Must be chlorine-free, clean, potable</li>
<li>Avoid minerals &#8211; hard water can slow it down or kill it so if you&#8217;re using tap, boil it first and then let it sit overnight; then reboil it for tea</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Sugar</h3>
<ul>
<li>1 cup sugar per 4L / 1 gallon of tea / kombucha. Don&#8217;t worry, 50-80% of the sugar gets converted</li>
<li>White is good; evaporated cane juice crystals is the best choice. A bag of Kirkland organic cane sugar is supposedly only $4!</li>
<li>If you decided to use honey, he recommends that you getÂ the pasteurized kind because the raw, unpasteurized kind contains anti-bacterial properties, thus may kill it[ref]Jun, is a honey-based kombucha, and <a href="http://www.kombuchabrooklyn.com/blog/jun-honey-based-kombucha/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">using raw honey</a> seems to yield success[/ref]. Honey will result in a faster brew; same with maple syrup, so use less if you use either kind.</li>
<li>Do not use artificial or plant sugar (e.g. stevia, agave), as it won&#8217;t work</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Tea</h3>
<ul>
<li>Black tea is the best; use bagged or loose</li>
<li>Avoid flavoured or herbal teas; any natural oils in them can kill the SCOBY (makes sense since some <a href="http://her.happyhippos.ca/2017/01/essential-oils-when-less-is-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">essential oils</a> have anti-fungal, anti-bacterial properties)</li>
<li>Should just stay &#8220;tea&#8221; in the ingredients; decaf is okay</li>
<li>BoilÂ 4-5 bags of teaÂ in aÂ 2 gallon pot of water for 15+ minutes; cool it down to lower than body temperature before adding it to the starter brew</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Ready State</h2>
<ul>
<li>Is the kombucha ready to drink?Â You can use a straw (and a finger to suck up some tea) for the taste test, or more scientifically, you can also use PH strips to check for the ideal 3.5 PH; a PH of 4.0 is indicative of a new batch, &lt;3.0 is more potent. For a 2 gallon batch, it will start stating like apple cider vinegar around Day 5, and generally, a batch would be ready in about 7-10 days. If you want to slow the process down, you can put the whole thing in the fridge. You can pour it out in a batch and leave some starter brew (batch brew), or add a new batch of freshly brewed tea to the container (continuous brew)</li>
<li>When it&#8217;s ready, you can do a secondary fermentation, where you add 10-20% of fruit or other flavours in a bottle of ready kombucha, such as ginger or pear, with or without pulp. Leave it in room temperature for 1-5 days. Sealed will make more carbonation (be careful when opening)</li>
<li>You can put it in the fridge to cool it before drinking, or you can drink it straight up.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Clean up</h2>
<p>When washing the jars and other equipment for kombucha, don&#8217;t use antibacterial soap, including on your hand; you can easily use hot water and vinegar to wash and rinse.<br />
ENJOY!		</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				When some friends asked me for suggestions for local hiking trails or places for a nice nature walk, I had to pause and use my memory and Google to help[ref]so I guess I can&#8217;t blame them if all they could find was a hike that charged $7 a person to see a waterfall some 40 mins away[/ref]; it can sure be challenge to find suitable ideas.<br />
To be honest, I&#8217;ve always wanted to explore some trails but have only maybe done a few as many of these trails are linear (and goes on for hours or days &#8211; with trail access at varies points) instead of loops, so it feels like there&#8217;s a lot more effort to do them (either doubling back or need to park two cars and shuttle back), but this time of the year is probably one of my favourite times to do nature walks[ref]I call them walks instead of hikes as I&#8217;m used to West Coast terrain[/ref].<br />
<a href="https://flic.kr/p/aCyEwY"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/6052/6320977980_5e41dff727_z.jpg" alt="IMG_9665" width="640" height="426" /></a><br />
So, here are some in KWC for my (and hopefully your) future reference &#8211; most of which I&#8217;ve narrowed down based on distance / time and how scenic or interesting the trail might be:</p>
<h3>Cambridge</h3>
<ul>
<li>Devil&#8217;s Creek Trail</li>
<li><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.raresites.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/seasonal-cliffs-and-alvars-trail-map.png" target="_blank" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=http://i2.wp.com/www.raresites.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/seasonal-cliffs-and-alvars-trail-map.png&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1476758739398000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGXMrMJMVUn2C6gI8iwmhIFpnF7xg" rel="noopener noreferrer">Trails along Blair Road (RARE):</a> the river side one has cliffs and water and a lookout (could extend to a loop); I always want to walk along this one when I drive by it</li>
</ul>
<h3>Kitchener</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.ontariotrails.on.ca/trails/view/homer-watson-park-trail" target="_blank" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=http://www.ontariotrails.on.ca/trails/view/homer-watson-park-trail&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1476758739398000&amp;usg=AFQjCNF5qmFYeWJXYsdUNjwUdrYtYwPILA" rel="noopener noreferrer">Homer Watson Park:</a> a 10-second walk from the car leads me to my favourite spot for a fall photo (one that overlooks the Grand River with coloured trees on either side). I discovered this sometime ago, from hunting around online, as it&#8217;s hidden and tucked away, but I haven&#8217;t actually ventured too far along the trail.&nbsp; Someone has kindly documented a 8km loop if you&#8217;re feeling adventurous or park a car at one end and walk to another parking spot and drive back to get the other car &#8211; â€Ž<a href="http://www.hember.ca/hikes/HomerWatson/" target="_blank" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=http://www.hember.ca/hikes/HomerWatson/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1476758739398000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHoJqTlz1Ag20rPH1QpbkkUZL0aJA" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://www.hember.ca/hikes/HomerWatson/</a><br />
Or, you can try for a shorter loop: <a href="http://hember.ca/hikes/HomerWatsonDoon/index.html" target="_blank" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=http://hember.ca/hikes/HomerWatsonDoon/index.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1476758739398000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFrPAGylOPdPgrWn2f3M14duu42gA" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://hember.ca/hikes/<wbr>HomerWatsonDoon/</wbr></a></li>

<li>Health Valley Trail: This one is a challenge to find it seems but you walk to downtown St Jacobs from Waterloo, so you could have lunch there after!</li>
<li><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>Mill Race trail: in the village of St. Jacobs, goes under a train trestle, a next to a creek in some spots, see some chipmunks or frogs, some farm land, and if you&#8217;re lucky you&#8217;ll also hear gun shots. At the end of the 2km linear trail, you will see a small dam (so it&#8217;s like a mini-waterfall, right?)</li>
<li>The <a href="http://thehydrocut.ca/">Hydrocut</a> (specifically, only the multi-use trail): this might offer a more challenging terrain (enter via the <a href="http://thehydrocut.ca/trails-map">Snyders Road parking lot</a>) â€Žbut be warned that despite it being a multi-use trail, you may encounter many mountain biking enthusiasts &#8211; as it&#8217;s &#8220;their&#8221; trail around here.

<li><a href="http://www.waterloo.ca/en/gettingactive/geotimetrail.asp">GeoTime trail</a>: This 4.5 km one seems like it would be an informative / educational walk vs. a hike &#8211; the concept is kind of neat, and I didn&#8217;t know this existed either; thanks, @jowu!</li>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				As a parent, I never would&#8217;ve expected to have to deal with such a fascinatingly skin-crawling experience, one that I hope never to have to deal with again.<br />
<figure id="attachment_5270" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5270" style="width: 150px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/IMG_20160623_073233.jpg"><img class="wp-image-5270 size-thumbnail" src="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/IMG_20160623_073233-150x150.jpg" alt="Photo courtesy of my mother-in-law" height="150" width="150"/></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-5270" class="wp-caption-text">Photo courtesy of my mother-in-law. After finally realizing what it was, it looks like it has burrowed into her head</figcaption></figure><br />
Around 6:30 AM one morning, Bean woke up and didn&#8217;t go back to sleep but was content to lie in bed with me. At some point, she told me that something was bothering her at the back of her head (her one-worded summary: &#8220;ow&#8221;), near the nape of her neck. In my sleepy haze, I parted her hair and took a peek. A skin-coloured lump, almost the size of my pinky fingernail, puzzled and troubled me so I tried to get a closer look with a tissue because I didn&#8217;t want to touch it because it looked like it had hair follicles, which also sort of resembled short insect-like legs. So, trying to hide my &#8220;heebies jeebies&#8221;[ref]the &#8220;heebie jeebies&#8221; accurately sums how I feel, as used by one forum poster with his experience[/ref], I asked her if she wanted Daddy or Grandma to come in to help me, and she said Grandma, so I went to get a second opinion. Grandma later told me she took a video and some photos and sent it to a doctor friend of hers, who admitted he didn&#8217;t know what it was, perhaps an insect bite or an infection with a sac. We made an appointment with our family doctor, and I started googling and looking for images of skin tags that matched what I had seen &#8211; nothing that looked that size, even though the description seemed to match.<br />
At the doctor&#8217;s office, the nurse and the doctor took a look and confirmed that it was a skin tag. Her explanation was in line with what I had read online: that they&#8217;re benign, often made of the same cells and components of your skin, so you will see things like hair follicles, and that this one had a stalk. I couldn&#8217;t figure out how I missed it (since I comb her hair daily), but I asked how long it could have been there for, and she explained that it could have been there for awhile but was hard to spot because it wasn&#8217;t bothering Bean. She told us that it look like it was going to auto-amputate because the stalk end/base was starting to turn bluish, so we had a few options:</p>
<ol>
<li>Leave it be, and see how long it would take. Usually for smaller skin tags, it takes 2-3 days, but this one could be slower because of its size.</li>
<li>Use liquid nitrogen to burn it off. I asked how the pain would be compared to a needle, and she said it would probably be the same intensity but longer.</li>
<li>Something similar to #2 but with local freezing. We opted to go with this.</li>
</ol>
<p><figure id="attachment_5269" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5269" style="width: 225px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/715.jpg"><img class="wp-image-5269 size-medium" src="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/715-225x300.jpg" alt="tick-closeup" height="300" width="225" srcset="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/715-225x300.jpg 225w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/715-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/715.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-5269" class="wp-caption-text">Photo courtesy of our doctor</figcaption></figure><br />
For whatever reason, she decided to take a second look, and this time, IT MOVED. I appreciate that she didn&#8217;t freak out, because I would have &#8211; and certainly did inside. Instead, she calmly said that she was going outside to get a second doctor&#8217;s opinion and help. The second doctor was a lot more certain that it was a tick and they partnered to quickly remove it with a pair of tweezers; it was still very much alive in the urine sample jar they put it in, so we assume that every bit came out (thus reducing Lyme disease, if at risk) &#8211; the second doctor must have really wanted to make sure for he must have pulled extra skin and hair off, because Bean started crying even more and I was handed a piece of gauze to apply pressure to stop the bleeding[ref]a week later, the spot looks raised with a dark scab, and it must feel tender because it still bothers her[/ref]. Google helped identify the tick as a dog tick, which isn&#8217;t as great of a threat as the black-legged ticks, but they jarred it anyway to be sent for analysis. She called a contact to see if we needed to start antibiotic treatment, as their guidelines only offered advice to those over 8 years of age. Later, she also followed up to tell us that Public Health would call if they found something of concern and texted us some close-up photos. We don&#8217;t have a dog, but we did go to the urban natural area the day before, and that&#8217;s likely where we picked it up.<br />
I also appreciated that she apologized and retracted her first diagnosis; she had seen ticks before, but none this size[ref]I don&#8217;t blame her &#8211; Google tells me that it was an adult female in its partially fed state so it would be bigger[/ref]. She&#8217;s a family doctor, so I can&#8217;t expect her to know everything, even though we hope they know what ails us. She recognized that even though I had made comments about characteristics reminding me of an insect, it was likely that everyone&#8217;s quick glance assumptions as a skin tag threw everyone off.<br />
<figure id="attachment_5267" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5267" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/20160623_144856_edit.jpg"><img class="wp-image-5267 size-medium" src="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/20160623_144856_edit-300x224.jpg" alt="topview-tickinjar" height="224" width="300" srcset="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/20160623_144856_edit-300x224.jpg 300w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/20160623_144856_edit.jpg 436w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-5267" class="wp-caption-text">Looking from the outside of the jar &#8211; doesn&#8217;t look as big as the close up, nor as creepy as when it was on her head.</figcaption></figure><br />
I like being outdoors. I enjoy aspects of camping, canoeing, and especially hiking; I remember my dad would take us on walks and bike rides around trails when we were much younger. In all my years doing activities outdoors, I would have never imagined having to deal with this. Thankfully, I think this experience was more traumatic for me than it was for Bean, since she didn&#8217;t see what was bothering her, despite some tears and pain.<br />
Thank God that Bean noticed it, and He answered our prayers, giving wisdom to our doctor who for reason decided to do a second&nbsp; look &#8211; because who knows if we would&#8217;ve found it otherwise. Plus, I am really glad that I didn&#8217;t have to remove it myself.		</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				I often look forward to Saturdays because there is still one more day left before the work week begins again. If I don&#8217;t have a chance to sleep in, and j.w doesn&#8217;t take the kids (or leaves me one while he plays MTG), it means that we can spend time together as a family &#8211;&nbsp;this usually means we do our weekly shopping trip at Costco or&nbsp;the Kitchener Market.<br />
A couple Saturdays ago, it was certainly a nice kind of different:&nbsp;we took part of a little library&nbsp;community build and we visited the region&#8217;s waste management site. &nbsp;</p>
<h3>Little Library &#8211; Community Build</h3>
<p><figure id="attachment_5221" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5221" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="size-medium wp-image-5221" src="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/IMG_20160423_093522-e1462586310284-300x300.jpg" alt="little library materials" height="300" width="300" srcset="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/IMG_20160423_093522-e1462586310284-300x300.jpg 300w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/IMG_20160423_093522-e1462586310284-150x150.jpg 150w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/IMG_20160423_093522-e1462586310284-768x768.jpg 768w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/IMG_20160423_093522-e1462586310284-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/IMG_20160423_093522-e1462586310284-1568x1568.jpg 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-5221" class="wp-caption-text">Little library build, gable-style</figcaption></figure><br />
At the start of the year,&nbsp;I had shared with j.w two of my <del>resolutions</del>[ref]I don&#8217;t believe in resolutions as I don&#8217;t (like to) make promises I can&#8217;t keep[/ref] goals for the year, which he has helped me to meet: make our bed daily (a little step towards to tidiness) and get a little library up and running in our front yard (community).<br />
A community build event took place and j.w put together most of the little library house. To our surprise, we now share another thing in common with our neighbours two houses down: not only do our sons share the same first name, but they also have the same gable-style library that they picked up the same morning!<br />
Sometime this summer, I aim to paint/stain it, seal it, and then put it up with some family-friendly reading, primarily books in the Christian and children genre. While there are plenty of other little libraries with children&#8217;s literature, I wonder what the uptake will be on Christian books. I have other little ideas for it, including maybe a Facebook group to post what&#8217;s available, a NFC check-in tag, as well a QR tag to track the location and review of the books that go through our little library &#8211; those are lofty ideas, so we shall see.</p>
<h3>Waterloo Region Waste Management &#8211; Open House</h3>
<p><figure id="attachment_5222" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5222" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="wp-image-5222 size-medium" src="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/IMG_20160423_122123-300x225.jpg" alt="Recycled material" height="225" width="300" srcset="https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/IMG_20160423_122123-300x225.jpg 300w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/IMG_20160423_122123-768x576.jpg 768w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/IMG_20160423_122123-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://emdashes.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/IMG_20160423_122123-1568x1176.jpg 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-5222" class="wp-caption-text">Cubes of compacted recycled cans</figcaption></figure><br />
After a morning of building most of the little library, we rushed to the waste management site. I had signed us up to go because of Bean&#8217;s interest in garbage trucks and buses &#8211; a school bus was to take us on a tour of the site, with pauses at the current landfill, and a stop at the recycling centre. If their goal of open houses is to send an environmental message home, I think it achieved it with our family; it probably ended up being the most educational for us, the parents. Here&#8217;s what I learned:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_box_recycling_system#History" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The (now world-wide) blue box recycling program started in Kitchener</a></li>
<li>The waste management site &#8220;hires&#8221; two <a href="http://www.therecord.com/news-story/4260095-this-job-is-for-the-birds/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hawks to send seagulls away</a> a few times a week</li>
<li>Mount Trashmore, our local popular tobogganing hill, was discontinued as a landfill in the &#8217;70s</li>
<li>Landfills that are at max capacity are capped with ceramic before being topped with soil and grass</li>
<li>Items you throw in the garbage that you know are biodegradable or claims to biodegrade in X days won&#8217;t actually ever if it ends up in the landfill because the environment isn&#8217;t right for it; it actually gets packed down (sort of WALL-E-like), so it lacks oxygen and organisms that break it down</li>
<li>A tarp-like sheet goes over every layer of garbage to keep it from blowing away and fumes and moisture are sent through pipes, where the methane gas is collected and converted into energy; I didn&#8217;t see any burning pipes anywhere, nor did it smell nearly as bad as the one we used to drive back next to Highway 1 back home before it got converted to a driving range</li>
</ul>
<p>You could say that we unknowingly took part in some Earth Day weekend activities, with a specific focus on recycling / reusing (books in the community instead of the garbage, and learning about recycling operations in our city). It felt like a long day, but it wasn&#8217;t even mid-afternoon yet by the time we finished! While I do enjoy doing our regular stops, after this past Saturday&#8217;s activities together as a family, I find it&#8217;s worth waking up early if it means doing something different.<br />
Some neat upcoming events in May around #kwawesome that you could do with your family, a date, or friends are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Saturday, May 7, 9-10:30a <a href="http://janeswalk.org/canada/kitchener/lets-have-coffee-or-10/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Coffee walk around Downtown Kitchener (DTK)</a></li>
<li>Sunday, May 8, 2p <a href="http://janeswalk.org/canada/kitchener/spur-line-trail-smile-tiger-berlin-bicycle-cafe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Coffee tour bike-ride on Spur Line Trail</a></li>
<li>Friday, May 27, 6-7p Listening choir DTK (probably not suitable for families with little ones, as they will likely get impatient or lose attention since there&#8217;s no speaking and you stand and appreciate the urban noise) &#8211; other dates are also available</li>
</ul>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				Now that the <a href="http://her.happyhippos.ca/2015/11/things-to-do-in-kw/">adults have ideas on what #kwawesome offers</a>, here&#8217;s a list of no or low-cost drop-in programs that are toddler friendly. While the local libraries, Early Years Centres, and some community centres / associations have great programs for children and caregivers, most of them require registration. I didn&#8217;t take Bean to many programs when she was younger because they were all offered in the morning, which conflicted with her morning nap; now that she&#8217;s just napping in the afternoon, these times work better for us. Drop-in programs are alsoÂ great for us because it allows flexibility: on low-key days,Â Â or the timesÂ we don&#8217;t have the car orÂ the weather isn&#8217;t bussing or walking friendly,Â we can choose to stay in.<br />
This list is really to help me keep a track of what&#8217;s being offered during the fall and winter terms around us (the start of summer usually means the end of some programs):</p>

<li><strong>Wednesdays:</strong> <em>to be determined, but you can alwaysÂ bring them to The MuseumÂ ($5 admission Wednesdays, free for child under 3)<br />
Or joinÂ <a href="http://www.ourplacekw.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Early Years Centre for Music and Movement</a> (offered weekdays. Songs with actions and parachute fun), 11:30-noon free (gym open for use prior to program), orÂ <a href="https://creeksidechurch.ca/playground/">Creekside Church indoor playground,</a> 9:30-11:30 AM free (Monday &#8211; Thursday, unstructured free play)</em></li>

				<description><![CDATA[A few nights ago, a friend asked me what there was to do in Kitchener-Waterloo, and how I found out about them. This isn&#8217;t&#160;the first time someone has asked for ideas, so I figured a compiled list of what I follow may be helpful to my other self and for future reference &#8211; and even though I don&#8217;t necessarily have time do venture out to many events offered around time, I still try sometimes! So what piques my interest?

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>A few nights ago, a friend asked me what there was to do in Kitchener-Waterloo, and how I found out about them. This isn&#8217;t&nbsp;the first time someone has asked for ideas, so I figured a compiled list of what I follow may be helpful to my other self and for future reference &#8211; and even though I don&#8217;t necessarily have time do venture out to many events offered around time, I still try sometimes! So what piques my interest? Generally, I like to know about free/low-cost activities that don&#8217;t need&nbsp;too much&nbsp;commitment.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Here are some of my sources:</div>
<ul>
<li>Meetup groups &#8211; a few that I subscribe to, include:
<ul>
<li>Badminton Fun in KW&nbsp;&#8211; John sends out a reminder of places that offer drop-in badminton around town (mostly at community centres)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.meetup.com/Tri-Cities-Food-Lovers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tri-Cities Food Lovers &#8211;</a> I tend to follow this group for restaurant ideas (haven&#8217;t been to a meetup yet)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.meetup.com/Its-On-Events-for-20s-30s-at-Kitchener-Public-Library/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">It&#8217;s On &#8211; Events for 20s and 30s</a>&nbsp;&#8211; a central place for all the events that Kitchener Public Library offers for a specific crowd, though open to all. Note that registration actually happens on the KPL site itself, and that most of it is just a repeat of what&#8217;s listed on the KPL Events Calendar (but easier to find here).</li>
<li><a href="http://www.meetup.com/Hiking-for-Beginners-in-Cambridge-ON/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hiking for Beginners</a> &#8211; while the group says Cambridge, Ontario, I find that a bunch of the hikes are actually in the Kitchener area. I tend to follow them to discover trails around me as the timing for the meetups hasn&#8217;t been right for me yet.</li>
<li>I also follow the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/KW-Chinese-English-Language-and-Cultural-Exchange/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chinese-English Social Cultural Exchange</a> meetup group to keep a tabs on Chinese eating places around town</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Public Library events
<ul>
<li>I tend to find out about interesting events from the library posters, TV screens, and their <a href="http://www.libraryaware.com/1111/Subscribers/Subscribe?showonlynewsletterlists=true">newsletters</a>;&nbsp;e.g. Etc., Music Notes, KPL News. Popular events that have limited seats tend to fill quickly, and if you end up registering late, you&#8217;ll be added to a waitlist. A few that I&#8217;ve attended include one on <a href="http://her.happyhippos.ca/2015/05/coffee-notes/">coffee</a>, making your own terrarium during #diyfestival,&nbsp; interior design, and an upcoming ones that seem interesting&nbsp;is an&nbsp;art class, an escape room adventure featured for international games day, and a <a href="http://kplca.evanced.info/signup/EventDetails.aspx?EventId=11432&amp;lib=" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DIY string art piece</a>.</li>
<li>You can also <a href="http://kplca.evanced.info/signup/EventCalendar.aspx">filter events in the calendar</a> to browse for ones that interest you (hint: set filters by Date: today&#8217;s date, leave end date open; Event type: Adult, Arts &amp; Culture, Business; Age Group: Adults &#8211; List view). Notably, KPL Central branch offers a weekly free movie&nbsp;screening in their theatre space.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Community Centres / Community Associations tend to offer many classes at a reasonable cost, but they usually require registration and a 8-10 weeks of commitment. I find that I have to browse through the leisure guides physically because&nbsp;the online versions aren&#8217;t very browseable (ref. <a href="http://issuu.com/cityofwaterloo/docs/waterloo_fall2015_web?e=1669671/14829852" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Waterloo</a> / Kitchener). I&#8217;ve noticed that similar classes tend to vary in price depending on where it&#8217;s offered, perhaps because of&nbsp;each community centre&#8217;s surrounding demographics (e.g. Downtown Kitchener seems to have lower drop-in prices than say RIM Park in Waterloo)
<ul>
<li>Cooking classes</li>
<li>Art classes (e.g. $5 a class for drawing)</li>
<li>Language classes (e.g. ASL &#8211; $5+ /class, Spanish, Conversational Chinese &#8211; $5 a class on Saturday mornings)</li>
<li>Social Dance / Ballroom dancing&nbsp;classes, even more affordable than the ones taught at University of Waterloo (outside of&nbsp;the clubs)</li>
<li>Drop-in sport activities &#8211; organized and self-organized, such as badminton (from $3 a session)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://enews.kitchener.ca/enews/signup.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">City of Kitchener</a> and <a href="http://enews.waterloo.ca/mailinglist/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">City of Waterloo</a> newsletters, which include a Kitchener Market sub-newsletter
<ul>
<li>By extension, the <a href="http://www.downtownkitchener.ca/en/index.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Downtown Kitchener BIA </a>also offers a e-newsletter that&nbsp;highlights events such as <a href="http://nightshiftwr.ca/">NightShift</a> and Art Market, and the <a href="http://frederickartwalk.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">annual Art Walk </a>(local artisans featuring their works for sale)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Free <a href="http://www.kitchener.ca/en/livinginkitchener/public_skating_schedule.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">community skating </a>/ <a href="http://www.timhortons.com/ca/en/social/free-swimming.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">swimming / aqua-fit</a> sessions</li>
<li>Theatre:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://kwlt.org/events" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">KW Little Theatre &#8211; some nights by donation or pay-what-you-can</a></li>
<li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/arts/alumni-friends" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Arts Alumni Theatre Night &#8211; free, registration required</a>&nbsp;&#8211; productions by current students at UW</li>
<li><a href="http://www.lostandfoundtheatre.com/index.php/ct-menu-item-11/ct-menu-item-13" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lost and Found Theatre &#8211; free nights</a>&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Free academic / public lectures, for the geek-nerds in us, such as:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://perimeterinstitute.ca/outreach/general-public/public-lecture-series" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PI Institute</a>&nbsp;&#8211; I have attended a couple in the past, one on music and physics</li>
<li>University of Waterloo <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/hagey-lectures/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Public Lectures</a> (and any of its affiliated colleges)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Miscellaneous:
<ul>
<li>I really enjoyed the events that Clipped Outdoors offered for women, but they haven&#8217;t been active in a while so I wonder what happened&#8230;</li>
<li>Community events offered by local churches&nbsp;(e.g. canning, community gardening) &#8211; I find out about them usually from their signs as a passerby</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
