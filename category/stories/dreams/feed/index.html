But it&#8217;s really strange that a few nights ago, in a dream, I had a revelation: I didn&#8217;t enjoy serving the most because everybody, all 11 others, are looking at you while you&#8217;re trying to serve &#8211; I felt a tremendous amount of unnecessary pressure to serve it right, and serve it well. So, when I didn&#8217;t have to serve, I actually found myself enjoying it a lot more.		</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				two of us were looking out the window on a taller building &#8211; we were both looking or waiting for someone &#8211; I had the sense that it was j.w I was looking for, and he, his significant other. As we peered out, I noticed that a storm was brewing below, with grey storm clouds like that of a hurricane.<br />
Somehow, a few of us ended up being transported into a building where if you crossed over an invisible line, you instantly age and going to the next one aged you again; going back didn&#8217;t help you become younger though because I tried. But we had to continue to go look for people, so we followed the masses of people, and as we passed through a door and up some stairs, he commented that I aged well, and he didn&#8217;t look bad either even though we both had grey hair. Eventually, I came to a wall and watched it come alive with actors. Somehow, we followed the actors out, and after I said something or did a little jig (something like the &#8220;password&#8221;), the body guard let us through. I felt that I instantly became younger again, and it seemed like we were in a mall but we had to be careful as we weren&#8217;t supposed to be there. Somehow, we saw a sign that said a theatre was showing a feature that we were interested in, but by the time we got there, it was full, so we went downstairs as we were directed to an overflow room. I knew we were fugitives when, as I passed some people seated, I saw some security close in, so I dropped whatever it was I had in my hand, which gave away our location and we tried to go down a flight of stairs to escape&#8230; [then the baby cried and woke me up]</p>
<hr />
It seemed like we were in a dating networking event, as we were supposed to dance with whomever asked you to dance. I did, but had no interest in the guy who asked me to dance. As I exited, I saw Grace and asked her about her experience since it seemed like no one asked her, but I was interrupting another conversation so didn&#8217;t get to hear it. After going down the stairs and out the glass doors into another part of the building, I ended up seeing someone I knew when I paused to stop to watch 4-5 people demonstrating how to shower when back-country camping.		</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				We decided to go on a trip to Nepal with a couple of others on impulse because Eric volunteered to take us around, but it was a 17km bike ride and we would fly to Beijing first. Because it was so last-minute, we were originally going to go with the clothes on our backs, which was a pair of shorts and a light t-shirt for me, which might have been a bit uncomfortable at 30C weather after biking for 17kms. However, someone asked whether it gets any cooler in Nepal, and someone replied with 2C. So, we stopped by someone&#8217;s parents place so everyone could grab something. My sister told me to tell them how it was because they had planned to visit Bericky there next year.  One of the guys put on a jimmy neu(t)ron bike short, and I had a made a mental note to ask Joseph what was a &#8220;Jimmy Neu(t)ron&#8221; when I woke up (and he reminded me it was  Nickelodeon TV show). I ended up using the master bathroom before leaving, but overheard the parents come into the room and start arguing, which was super awkward, so I just piped up and said that I was in the bathroom.<br />
I, or, someone questioned biking the 17km in 2o minutes. I didn&#8217;t think I had the endurance or speed from the airport to their destination, which was mostly dirt shoulder on the side of the road, in 20 minutes, or even in 1 hour, perhaps maybe more like 5km/hr so would be better if 3 hours. As for why we even say we&#8217;d go? We had been thinking about going to Jamaica anyway, as one of our friends had told us about an orphanage that they worked with there, but if we had gone there, our friend wouldn&#8217;t have been there and we wouldn&#8217;t know the language; but, in Nepal, we would have a personal translator and a guide.		</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				I found myself jogging on an early grey and rainy morning. The street was eerily quiet, so it was unusual to run into a thin, frail teenager. She told me she had run away from home (possibly pregnant?) and could not continue school and was on her way to find shelter in a forest. I tried to locate forests in my mind. Instead, I ended up offering the roomfor emergency situations like these at a local church where I worked part-time. I took her there, but it must have been late by the time we arrived (either middle of the night or still very early in the morning), because I remember coming up the back door, and asking Loretta, someone who worked and lived there if we woke her up (and we had). I quickly explained that my new friend needed the room for the night, and we settled her in.<br />
I went upstairs to seek out the pastor to explain the situation and to see if we could work out something &#8211; perhaps offer her the room upstairs month to month in exchange for counselling? Afterall, the church had a bus stop in front of it, and a high school across from it, so she could finish her studies as a new face &#8211; a new start so to speak. it would&#8217;ve costed $80 a day, but I was certain motels would have been cheaper but she wouldn&#8217;t have gotten the care or the means to pay either. Here, she would have independence with some help.<br />
I don&#8217;t know how it resolved because I was tired and everyone needed sleep. And I woke up from this dream.<br />

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				My very own puzzle hunt. There&#8217;s a puzzle hunt at j.w&#8217;s workplace next weekend, and I guess my brain is anticipating it already:<br />
I was with Bonnie, who was visibly pregnant. We had to get out of this tower and try to get to some centre. But the structure kept falling apart whenever we put our legs. Eventually, we got out and walked to the other side of the street, which seemed like somewhere in China. It happened that it was a block of stores and parking, and one pathway to the place that we were trying to get to, was through the Premium Outlet lot. I remember thinking that I didn&#8217;t have any RMB on me, but that I could use my credit card if I bought anything. On our way there, we passed by a sign that pointed to the building, as well as to the Toronto Zoo.<br />
I don&#8217;t think I did though, and went to the building and started trying to get to the end of the maze. Depending on what turn you took, you&#8217;d have some consequences. For example, some decided to watch the symphony, but it would have taken hours of your time (a time waster); a hallway had different &#8220;paths&#8221; on the floor so it would respond in different ways depending on where your foot touched (eg. The emotion floor would be black but like a mood ring, would ripple the color your mood was where you walked). There was also not-as-safe choices too, like I almost followed two girls into a corridor on my left,  thinking that I knew where they were going because they came from the hall in front of me.  But turned out, that it was just a hall that went in a square box. However, it was some sort of psycho ward, in that once you&#8217;re in, you don&#8217;t come out because your mind is altered into thinking or fearing what&#8217;s outside that ward. Even if you know it&#8217;s safe &#8211; I tried to pull her back out but her mind kept her back. She did whisper to me that she thinks the right path was in the direction they came, which was a helpful clue.<br />
Then, depending on the fork you take, and how you answer a football question, the end of it you got to leave and get a discount credit card, where the discount would reflect on your choices. I went straight (where the girls came) and got 60% off future purchases after following someone else&#8217;s choice that seemed logical since I knew nothing about football and was bad at math,  but I noticed someone got additional cash. I later realized that if I had taken the right corridor, I would have ended up with 75% off.<br />

But it seemed to get worse, so I grabbed a vial of fire extinguisher, unscrewed it and shook it onto the fire (white powder) &#8211; that seemed to have done the trick. I was more impressed with the fire extinguisher, that I went down to (Elena? whose house it might have been) and said that hers was a lot easier to use than ours, which was the traditional pull pin and spray type.</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>Earlier this week, I somehow found a way to get to a conference by going along in jkung&#8217;s flight (cessna type of plane). when I got there, i found that those who stayed overnight and had driven would have gotten $2 off their conference. I felt a little ripped off..<but I'm not sure why since it's only $2!></but>		</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				I had dropped into some shops and boutiques on the street, but each shop was a standalone. Went into one asking about whether one had seen some crime in the neighbourhood, and she commented on something and mentioned that NNUptown next door (which for some reason was also a detached one) closed early for the day. I had wanted to see if they had all been hit too. Someone near the neighbour had given me a punch, which had resulted in a bruised eye. Eventually, I ended up in a building, where the culprit was, and was just chatting with him (to get him to admit his crime) at a safe distance before the police came to arrest him. He reminded me of Jamie S (and maybe was). Apparently, he had a moment of insanity and had killed someone. The police had been convinced that he had done some other related crimes and had done it with intent. But from my conversation with him, it didn&#8217;t seem that way. </p>
<p>So, I persuaded them to let me talk to him at the custody jail, with me wired. Going in, I ended up speaking with the front desk in Cantonese, so others didn&#8217;t know I was wired. I was also allowed in with my BlackBerry, so I was able to record the conversation (for my records in case the police decided to snip pieces of the conversation). Yes, he admitted to one crime on an act of impulse, but no, it didn&#8217;t seem like he was capable of the others.
