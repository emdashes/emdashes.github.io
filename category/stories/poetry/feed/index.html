								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				<![CDATA[At 13 months*, Little Bean's 8th tooth started&nbsp;to peek through;


<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Her&nbsp;diet expanded to cheese, yogurt, quinoa, and other adult foods,</p>




<p style="padding-left: 30px;">and she&nbsp;started to feed herself at times with a fork and a spoon and drink from an open cup with her own hands.</p>


At 13 months, Little Bean ensured her&nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/doudouetcompagnie/photos/pb.127083427321397.-2207520000.1410752134./176551445707928/?type=3&amp;theater" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">favourite bear</a> nursed from Mama (with her help and her&nbsp;sound effects),


<p style="padding-left: 30px;">and she spoon-fed another bear at the high chair, already engaging in&nbsp;pretend play!</p>


At 13 months, Little Bean stood up unassisted;


<p style="padding-left: 30px;">and took many large steps assisted.</p>


She figured out how to&nbsp;climb up and down steps,


<p style="padding-left: 30px;">and get down from the couch;</p>


And she figured out how to turn off the lights, but not turn them on
At 13 months, she pooped in her tub during bathtime for the first time &#8211; <em>eew! </em>and again within weeks of each other &#8211; <em>double</em> <em>eew!</em>
At 13 months, she has taken to practicing standing up, signing more, playing boo, and clapping in the middle of the night between sleep cycles.


<p style="padding-left: 30px;">But best of all,&nbsp;at 13 months, Little Bean gave us a great anniversary present by sleeping for 7 hours through&nbsp;the night on our 5th anniversary!</p>


<span style="color: #808080;">&#8212;</span>
<span style="color: #808080;">*These milestones took place during the month, and didn&#8217;t all happen on one day</span>]]&gt;		</p>

<p>Written in 1992:</p>




<p>Going to beaches<br />
In the summertime can be fun<br />
But be careful, there might be leeches</p>




<p>Build a sandcastle that is really tall,<br />
When you are finished,<br />
You can destroy it, once and for all</p>




<p>Walking on the bumpy sand,<br />
When the tide is low<br />
Going through the seaweed,<br />
It tickles like snow</p>




<p>The next time you go to a beach,<br />
Please remember what I said,<br />
Be careful of clams and stuff<br />
For they might squirt you in the head !_!
</p>




<p>9.5/10</p>




<p>It&#8217;s obvious that my poetry needs some work&#8230;</p>

<p>Twitter doesn&#8217;t allow edits once it&#8217;s posted, so I&#8217;ve added the missing words in the square brackets.</p>




<h3>Winter</h3>


christmas lights are on.<br />
you bask in [the] warm weather; <br />
we retreat from cold.


<h3>Spring</h3>


You bake in [our] heat;<br />
we have your clouds, rain, your spring.<br />
The grass is greener.]]&gt;		</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				<![CDATA[Leadership is Adam, giving to the livestock, the birds of the air, the beasts of the field, the fish in the sea, and of course, Eve.
<br />
Leadership is Noah, rounding animals two by two into the ark, preparing his family for the storm that was to come.
<br />
Leadership is Moses commanding Pharaoh, “Let my people go,” and then bringing them out of Egypt, trusting Jehovah Jireh, their Provider.<br />
Leadership is Miriam, the prophetess of God, her voice leading in song of praise and jubilee.<br />
Leadership is Deborah, the prophetess and judge over Israel, mediating disputes between the Israelites.<br />
Leadership is David, the shepherd boy stepping up to face the giant Goliath with El-Shaddai, the Almighty God.<br />
Leadership is the Shepherd who leads the sheep beside still waters and onto lush green pastures.<br />
Leadership is the Lover inviting His Beloved to come with Him in words of the Song of Solomon.<br />
Leadership is John the Baptist, the strong voice in the desert crying, &#8220;Prepare ye the way of the Lord!&#8221;<br />
Leadership is Jesus, kneeling to wash the disciples’ calloused, dirt-covered and pungent feet.<br />
Leadership is the husband who loves his wife, just as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her.<br />
Leadership is servanthood, for where a servant’s heart is, there a leader will be also.

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				<![CDATA[The vastness of the oceans <br />
    The depths of the seas <br />
    It is the void <br />
    That lies inside of me
  

<p>The echoes of soaring eagles <br />
    Between the peaks at the top <br />
    The emptiness is filled <br />
    By the power of God </p>


  

<p>The grey of stormy skies <br />
    The blackness of night <br />
    Is the searching soul <br />
    Where there is no light </p>


  

<p>The flame of a bonfire <br />
    Burning &#8216;neath the stars <br />
    The Father of Light <br />
    Suffocates the dark </p>


  

<p>The icy waters of the Arctic <br />
    The glaciers of high mountains <br />
    Lies the coldness of the heart <br />
    Like sharp icicles: frozen </p>


  

<p>The heat of the Sahara <br />
    Warm rays of sunshine <br />
    Thaws the hardened spirit <br />
    From the heart of the Creator to mine </p>


  

<p>The deep canyons of raging waters <br />
    The burst of the fiery volcano <br />
    A lost spiritual battle <br />
    Out of control </p>


  

<p>A vibrant rainbow <br />
    Reaching across the sky <br />
    A promise of God <br />
    That He will forever be standing by </p>


  

<p>(1998) </p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				<![CDATA[  

<p>It was a seemingly normal day, <br />
    When they came and took Him away. <br />
    From a place called Gethsemane, <br />
    Where He was praying on bended knees. </p>


  

<p>They put Him to shame, <br />
    As they made fun of His name. <br />
    They struck Him with a splintered rod, <br />
    Because He claimed to be the Son of God. </p>


  

<p>They used metal, glass, bones, and lead, <br />
    To construct a whip that made Him bled. <br />
    Flogged Him forty-times minus one, <br />
    But after all that they weren&#8217;t quite done. </p>


  

<p>He suffered from great pain, <br />
    When they struck Him again and again. <br />
    Bleeding, bruised, and almost dead, <br />
    They placed a crown of thorns upon His head. </p>


  

<p>Flesh torn open from the thorns and whip, <br />
    They put a robe around His body and hip. <br />
    It soaked the blood that was shed, <br />
    The royal purple turned scarlet red. </p>


  

<p>They mocked Him and spat on His face, <br />
    The once recognizable man was now at utter disgrace. <br />
    They heeded to drive wrought iron nails through His wrist, <br />
    And through the heel bones without a single miss. </p>


  

<p>&#8216;The King of Jews&#8217; was fixed above His head, <br />
    And on the cross He was crucified and left for the dead. <br />
    Imagine, if you had the power of this man that day, <br />
    Would you throw yourself off the cross and say, </p>


  

<p>&#8220;I condemn you all for bringing me through this!&#8221; <br />
    For He did no wrong in God&#8217;s midst. <br />
    But with a single cry and a soft moan, <br />
    He chose to die even when His Father left Him alone. </p>


  

<p>The man, Jesus, was indeed He, <br />
    Who gave up His life for you and me. <br />
    Who conquered death after three days, <br />
    For He was no longer where His body was laid. </p>


  

<p>So, we are saved by His grace, <br />
    From falling into the eternal fiery place. <br />
    We never truly realize why He freed us of our fate, <br />
    Until we learn that His love for us was just too great. </p>


  

<p>This is where God demonstrated His love, <br />
    He sent His only Son from above. <br />
    We need to give glory where due, <br />
    Because Love sacrificed itself for you. </p>


  

<p>(1997) </p>

<p>Life is like a dream<br />
    Endless hours of<br />
    Reckless adventures<br />
    Life is like a dream<br />
    Filled with surprises<br />
    Full of excitement<br />
    Life is like a dream<br />
    Sweet memories of<br />
    Tender moments<br />
    Life is like a dream<br />
    Pale blue skies<br />
    Sunny weather<br />
    But, like a dream<br />
    It too ends</p>
